There will be battles ahead but this was another amazing people-powered victory. When people unite, we have power. This time people power defeated big oil and big finance. View of the camp from Media Hill. When we arrived at the Oceti Sakowin Camp this morning, we were impressed by its size and organization. From our view on the highway, the camp stretched far into the distance and was packed with all kinds of structures. Some long time camp residents said that the camp population had doubled this weekend. We estimate that at least 1,000 cars and buses came to the camp today.When we arrived at the Oceti Sakowin Camp this morning, we were impressed by its size and organization. From our view on the highway, the camp stretched far into the distance and was packed with all kinds of structures. Two of the Yurts at the MedicHealer Council. The camp looked full and we were concerned that finding a parking space would be difficult. We called Popular Resistance reporter, Crystal Zevon and she met us at the entrance gate to show us around. The main street is lined with flags. We followed it to the MedicHealer area and found a spot not too far away. We had a large bag of donations to deliver. The MedicHealer area consisted of a series of yurts with colorful doors and storage tents and sheds. The daily noon orientation was cancelled due to the overwhelming influx of new people. Margaret set to work helping to organize new donations and Kevin set out to deliver non-medical donations and find the legal tent. People hear the news of the Corps of Engineers decision at the Sacred Circle. The courage and ethics of the participants at Standing Rock, some of whom have been there since April, were like a magnet to those of us who care about justice and the future of the planet. Tens of thousands showed up in solidarity at this ceremonial, prayer camp that stood for Indigenous rights and the people and planet over corporate profit. In the afternoon, the news went around that the Army Corps of Engineers denied the permit for the final phase of the pipeline. At first it was hard to believe and we were skeptical. People whooped and hollered, pumped fists in the air, beat drums and danced in celebration. They were installing military tents with wood stoves, indeed wood stoves could be seen in many parts of the camp ready for installation. Solar panels were also evident in various parts of the camp, ensuring a long-term energy supply. Youth snow sliding down Media Hill. There were so many people there that it would have been very difficult to clear the camp. We recognize this is an important victory, but not a final one. On their Facebook page the Standing Rock Sioux are also clear. They write that there are still many questions to be answered . Here are ten issues they have initially raised, no doubt more information will be coming from them soon. 1. 6. 10. Last week people united stopped ratification of the TPP against transnational corporate power. Now, this is a tremendous victory over the oil industry as well as their big financiers. Watch out, people may soon realize we have power when we join together and mobilize. Kevin Zeese and Margaret Flowers We head back to the Oceti Sakowin camp tomorrow. We look forward to finding out what the next steps will be in this campaign.

Comments Stephen Fox says December 5, 2016 at 9:26 am I have to say that I think National Monument idea is untenable. These last minute deals people are asking Obama to do are like crying out for someone to bring a couple of band aids to cover up a major gash. In the context of the coming administration such last minute efforts would be targeted to be immediately overturned, I regret to say. To the authors: I would love to discuss this someday on the air with you. In the following article, I am particularly interested in what you might have to say in the context of my discussing two Cabinet appointments., Attorney General and Homeland Security.

KARIM-ALY KASSAM: Ladies and gentlemen, we are on the traditional lands of the Cayuga. And, therefore, it is appropriate that this event begins with that acknowledgement. It is my honor to ask Sachem Sam George, a chief of the Cayuga people, to welcome Chairman Archambault, leader of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation. Sachem George. And what happens is usually, when we have newcomers or people come visit, we have a words before all else. And I'll just do a short version today, because we have big, big things going on. I'm a little nervous here. Lot of people in partner. I still get this way. And I have a present for you from all of us. Representatives of the Cayuga Nation; executives of the Seneca Nation; representatives of the Oneida Nation; Dr. Laura Spitz, Vice Provost for International Affairs Dr. Patrick Sullivan, Chair of the Department of Natural Resources; Dr. Jolene Rickard, Director of the American Indian and Indigenous Studies program; students and faculty; ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today. I am told that this event is being watched from California to Central Asia, in the Kyrgyz Republic, in Tajikistan, and in Afghanistan through Livestream. It is tradition in my department that we begin our events by acknowledging those who have made it possible. The work of staff, students, and faculty in the Department of Natural Resources, in the American Indian and Indigenous Studies program, and at the vice provost's office have made this event possible. Thank you, all. Now, it is my honor to introduce a soft spoken, gentle, courageous, and thoughtful man, who needs no introduction. Members of my research group at Cornell University have been undertaking research in partnership with tribal institutions in Standing Rock for nearly a decade. I've had the opportunity to interact with Chairman David Archambault several times. And I'm consistently impressed with his humility and his commitment. He was recently named by Foreign Policy magazine as the global thinker of 2016, for his stewardship of the Dakota-Lakota homeland. Just 24 hours ago, in Washington, he received the Native American Leadership Award from the National Congress of American Indians. We looked around and saw tremendous work being done here and elsewhere, in partnership with communities and scholarly institutions. Concrete efforts were being made to bring about hope for the future. Today, let us listen and then act wisely, because we have a man here, despite recent setbacks, where his community and he are building hope, not just for themselves, but for humanity as a whole. Folks, please help me welcome Chairman David Archambault, leader of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation. You said you're nervous. I just hope that if I have anything that I can offer, that you receive it. And I'll try to do my best. And one of the things that I want to do is make sure that we do create that hope, the hope that is necessary for the future. And so when I look at everything that I do, it's always trying to base my decisions on the best outcome for the kids who are not even born yet. So there's a lot of things that I face with every day. There's a lot of different challenges where I live. And I deal with them on a daily basis. And it's not always easy. But as long as I put a focus on the future, I could sleep at night. So that's kind of how I look at things. So what I'll do is I'll try to-- if I could instill any sense of hope in where we have to go-- and I'll talk a little bit about the history of my nation, of why we are in this stance. And I'll try to tie it into what we can do in the future and the things that we have to be aware of. So with that, I just want to first start by thanking Sam George for the welcome and for letting me be on your lands and all the leadership who has come. I created friendships with many tribal nations across the country. And it's hard for me to remember names, but I know faces, and I know character. And I know I have some really good, close friends that I trust. And that's just because of the support that I got when I was in a time of need for it. So I thank you guys for being here and showing your support. Karim, I want to thank you for giving me this opportunity. Karim was at Standing Rock. And so that was our discussion. And I promised him I would come out, and we could have that conversation here. This was in 2015, before pipeline was a big issue, before Dakota Access Pipeline was a big issue. And so I promised him I'd come. And we set this date. And I made sure that I was going to be here for it. So I'll start by just going with our history. So as indigenous peoples, the first peoples of these lands, we entered into treaties with other nations. And it was something that wasn't uncommon. It was about peace. And so there's different types of treaties that were honored and created. And one of the treaties that we entered into, with our own membership, was not on paper. It was with the peace pipe. So a pipe was loaded. And that pipe was a reminder. And it never was smoked. And as long as that was filled, our treaties were honored. And then, around here, they use wampum beads as a treaty. So each tribal nation had a way, without writing on paper. And it was oral history and something that we've learned and known about. But in the early 1800s, when we started interacting with the Europeans, we started entering into written treaties. And early on, like 1803, our tribes entered into treaty. I want to say 1830s. There was a treaty that was written that put us under the federal government. So that was one of the first things that happened. And then, in 1851, we had a Horse Creek Treaty. And this Horse Creek Treaty was on the North Platte River in Nebraska. And it was a trail from the east to the west. And there was a trail where-- they called it the Mormon Trail. And they were going up towards Oregon. But there was confrontation. So 1851, we said we'll enter into a treaty with the federal government. And it encompassed 60 million acres. And the first thing on there, the first article was there will be no war. So it was a peace treaty with us. And 1868, on the Fort Laramie Treaty, it was because there's a Powder River. There was a finger on our 60 million acres. And the Mormons were cutting across it. And we had a Powder River War. So we had to enter into another treaty. But in this treaty, they took some land from the 1851 boundary. And that was kind of like-- today, what we call it is a poison pill. We'll never get that. So we understood that. And we knew that. Because of this resource that the United States looked for, gold, which is more precious to them than life, they wanted that land. And so they knew that they couldn't get it. So what they did was they came out, and they negotiated with a few leaders. But at the same time, 60 million acres was the territory that buffalo roamed. And buffalo were getting killed. So food was becoming a hardship. So it came to a point where we either have to sign or we have to starve. Sign or starve. And I always resented the leadership at that time for signing, but I really didn't understand until today, in my capacity. I know what they were dealing with. It's hard when you're thinking about the future. So those leaders back then, when I think about it, were thinking about me. And I'm here today because of what they've done. So it was an agreement that they worked not with Congress, but with agents. Federal agents came out. And our 60 million acres was reduced down to the west side of the Missouri River in South Dakota and cut out the Black Hills. When we signed this agreement, the agreement went back to DC. And then, there was an act of Congress. So now, it's no longer treaties or treaty amendments. It's now Congress taking action, Congress saying, OK, we can take land. So another act came in 1889. And this act said, we will reduce that land to today's current day reservation. So the Standing Rock Sioux tribe is on about the size of Connecticut, 2.3 million acres. We straddle North Dakota and South Dakota. We're along the Missouri River. , Today we have about 16,000 members. About 8,000 of our members live there on Standing Rock. So remember this number, 8,000 members. And that's who put me in office, in my office, in my capacity. Soon after that, another act came. It's called Dawes Act. In 1908, we had-- It's also known as the Allotment Act. So what they did was they said, every individual here is going to be a lottee, and you're going to get land. And whatever's left over, we're going to open it up to settlers. So when I think about why are they doing this, why are they continuing to take land, it's for economic development. In North Dakota and South Dakota, you have agriculture, grazing. One good thing about Standing Rock is we'll see a lot of native grass. You don't see a lot of agriculture taking place. So agriculture, they'll kill everything, and they'll put one species, plant species in. With us, we maintain, and we try to protect the Native grasses that exist. In 1876, the Great Sioux Nation and the Cheyenne defeated General Custer in a war, in Greasy Grass, Battle of Bighorn, Battle of Little Bighorn in Montana. And there was lessons from that. Our leader, Sitting Bull-- I always used to say this. And Sitting Bull is a world renowned leader. And they all say, yeah. That's my tribe. But recently, I would say Standing Rock, and people know where Standing Rock's at. So in 1876, we defeated Custer. Sitting Bull took off to Canada. And then, he came back. When he came back, he was considered hostile. So the federal government at that time implemented-- trying to think of the word-- simulation. Or it was to try to make him non-Indian. Assimilation. And it was with his family. So with our tribe, you'll see a lot of the leadership was killed. Sitting Bull was killed. Any tribes that had resistance to the federal government, they would take the heads off. In 1914, we had World War I. So the same names that defeated the United States were the same ones that were fighting alongside US in the First World War. My wife and I-- my wife is with me. And I always have to point her out. She's the most beautiful thing ever. Sorry. We got a chance to visit the President. And when we went to the White House, there's this room, the secretaries' room. And they have flags, all the flags from all the military branches. And they have the United States flag. And then, they have war ribbons hanging off. And one of these war ribbons, it had Pine Ridge. And Pine Ridge is in South Dakota. Every ribbon represents a war that the United States was in. And that was that one. That was a war in, I want to say, 1880, Wounded Knee Massacre. They called it a war. And it was a war where they got the most Congressional Medals of Honor for the guys that mowed down with Hotchkiss guns women and children. And they were from Standing Rock. They left Standing Rock when Sitting Bull got killed. So 1914, we are fighting in World War I. 1918. 1924, they say, you can be the citizens of this country. So before 1924, and in the 1800s, we weren't even considered humans. And if you look at all the acts that were taking our lands, we were not even citizens. We didn't have say. And so this is just the beginning of a lot of the wrongs that were committed. And there's similar stories to other nations, other tribal nations. In 1934, there was an IRA Government Act, another act. You have to create an IRA government. Standing Rock said, no, we're not going to accept that government. We have our own constitution. 1914, we passed the constitution to organize. And we're going to stay with that. But there was two things that came with the IRA. We received the benefits from the government. And we see their Constitution. Who pushed their Constitution aside, but we said, we'll receive your benefits. So in every decade, there was something happening with Indian country and with Standing Rock. In 1944, in that area, there was this act. It was called the Pick-Sloan Act. And it was named after a general in the Army Corps of Engineers and a general in Bureau of Reclamation, Pick and Sloan. And it was an act to create a dam system on the Missouri River. And there were seven dams that were built. So when we had the Allotment Act, our members were given a piece of land, 640 acres. And everybody in our membership said, we want it by the river. We want it on the river bottoms, because there's trees. There's fruits. There's game. There's everything that we need to survive. So if you look at Standing Rock, and you see the allotments, it's all along the Grand River and the Missouri River. And the rest of the farmland was turned into fee land that was settled by non-Indians. So in 1944, Pick-Sloan Act, it was the largest dam system in the world. And by 1958, they completed the dam. And we had our most precious lands flooded. To create these lakes for recreation and for energy independence. So when I look back, the Black Hills, national security, gold is used to back the currency. Taking of our land is economic development to this nation. And then, we have energy independence, hydroelectricity. So these things are coming up. Not only are these wrongs that were being committed to us, but because we were considered aggressive or hostile, our kids were taken and are put in boarding schools. And when our kids were put in boarding schools, they were not allowed to speak. So I have a grandmother. She had passed away. But she was a fluent speaker of our language. And she did not speak to her kids, my dad, because she would get beaten in school if she spoke her language. And she didn't want that pain to go on to her children. So she did not allow them to speak our language. And this was the federal policy at the time. The federal policy is kill the Indian, but save the man. Let's assimilate them as fast as we can. And if your tribe was considered hostile, the assimilation was more forceful. There was a lot of things that were happening that created trauma. It's hard to explain the boarding school era. All I can say is if any of you have children-- I see a little one. Soon as she turns three years old, we're going to take that little one away and put them in another country. And they cannot speak the language, your native tongue. And if they do, they're going to get beat. And not only that, the schools are going to rape them. That's what's happening to Indians in this nation. And so that hardship comes back. And when we have our students graduating high school, all they want to do is be home. They don't want to go to school anymore. They don't want to go to college. What I'm sharing to you is kind of like the wrongs that have been committed to us. And there's been a lot of wrongs. And it's important that you understand that, so that you understand what happened at Standing Rock in this movement. It created trauma. It created hardship. We didn't do it to ourselves. So if I look at the 10 poorest counties in this nation, 10 poorest counties, five of them are of the Great Sioux Nation. We have Pine Ridge, our Oglala, Rosebud. We have Cheyenne River and two of them on Standing Rock. So there's five of the poorest counties in this country come from the Great Sioux Nation. This is because of the treatment of what happened to our people. And with poverty comes all the symptoms. So you have high suicide rates, high abuses, high alcoholism, high drug use, lack of housing, lack of law enforcement. These are symptoms. And it's not just common in any country. It's common in any area where there's poverty. You'll see the same symptoms wherever you go. Nicole and I grew up on the reservation. And we have two children. Our daughter is 23, and our son is 17. I taught them everything I know, but they don't know anything. But you have to have a choice. And our parents made a choice to stay on the reservation. And so when it's our time, we have children. And what we can look at is the environment. And I say, yeah, because even though you have high poverty, there's so much beauty with our culture. There's so much beauty with our land. There's so much beauty with the people. There's so much that is there that we love. And it's our choice. And we know that if we love our children, no matter what, they're going to do good. So it was our choice to stay. And if you ever get a chance to visit any reservation, you'll see for yourself, with your own eyes, beyond the poverty. You'll see the prairie grasses. You'll see the hills, the rolling hills. You'll see the people. You'll see the songs. You'll see the ceremonies. You'll see the things that we cherish. The community, all the communities. So that's why we're there. Now, in 2003, in North Dakota, there was this oil boom taking place, taking off. So North Dakota became a state that was recognized in the nation as the lowest unemployment. But they didn't count the reservations. They just said, it's the lowest unemployment. There's 20,000 jobs. People from all over the country were flocking. People were coming all over. And this oil boom brought a lot of things. Brought money, but it also brought crime, and it brought drugs. When this thing hit North Dakota, I think marijuana was the drug that was on our reservation. But then we start seeing stuff like cocaine. That We never saw that before. It was stuff like heroin, black heroin, meth. Meth became something that is rampant. And it's different. These drugs are completely different. So in 2007, our tribe said, we don't want pipelines in our ancestral lands, because we saw not only the bad that was coming with the social ills with this oil boom, but we saw the environmental ills. And we saw unregulated pipelines being punched in. We saw fracking solutions, fracking water. That's crazy. He was going around buying fee land. And he was going around telling people that he wants to frack. He's going to frack on Standing Rock. So the Standing Rock Sioux tribe said, we don't want that. We know what happens to the environment when you do that. So we said, we don't want this. Not only that we don't want the fracking. We don't want the pipeline. So we took action way before Dakota Access Pipeline. 2013, There's this KXL Pipeline. And it's trying to cut through our treaty lands. And there's this stance. There's a movement by reservation, by tribes in Great Sioux Nation, saying no KXL Pipeline. But we officially opposed it. We also sent letters to the Department of Interior, the EPA, Department of the Army. We sent letters out saying, we oppose this. And we also passed resolutions opposing KXL Pipeline. 2013, I get elected as the chairman of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. And the only reason I get elected is because I want to try to-- I love our people. I love our home. And I know that we're in a state of dependency. I know that there's poverty. But that's not the only thing there. I know that we can do things like food sovereignty. There's all kinds of opportunities that we can pursue. And if I could just bump us in a new direction, and if I could-- our focus has been focusing on our children. And all the problems, the issues that we have, we create the brilliant minds to solve all the things that plague us. So that's why I became the chairman. And I know this is something that took place over 200 years. I can't reverse that overnight. I can't reverse that in my term. But I can nudge us in a new direction. So that's what it is, showing that I care for kids and that if we invest in them, they'll have the answers in the future. 2014 comes. There's the Dakota Access Pipeline. And we have this company approaching our tribal council, saying we're going to build this pipeline right here, 500 feet away from your lands. And the tribal council and I said, don't do it. You're going to meet resistance. And we have it. It's on YouTube. If you look it up, you'll see the meeting. And it's verbatim, the conversation that we had. I go home, and I tell Nicole about this. Well, it threatens water. Well, she's telling me that-- that's why I said that's funny. She don't even bathe in water. I'm just teasing. I have to pick on Nicole. I love her, so she understands. But water is important to us. Water's a part of our ceremonies. Water is-- it's a source of life. So water is a source of life, just like the sun is a source of life, just like this Earth is a source of life, and just like the air that we breathe is a source of life. Those are sources of life that are beings need to exist, so that our spirits can occupy these bodies that we're in. But it means that everything is connected. Everything is related. So it's important. Water's important. And it was something that started with our kids. Our youth said, we don't want oil in our water. And they made a stance. And they ran to DC. And when our kids speak up, it's time for us to stand behind them. It's time for us to support them. When they want to say something, we encourage them to say it. When they want to do something, encourage them to do it. And it's a different time for me, because when I was growing up, it was hard for me to identify as who I am or what I am. But our kids today are saying, I want to learn the language. I'm proud to be Indian. It's cool to be Indian. And so we are very supportive of them. In 2015, we did everything that we could. We wrote to all the agencies. We visited DC. We went to Department of Interior, went to EPA. We went to Advisory Council Historic Preservation. And we got them to write letters in support. And our argument is that we never had an opportunity to have a say in the scoping of this Dakota Access Pipeline. If we did, we would have said, stay out of our treaty lands, because there are sacred places there, something that's important to us. And so, by protecting the water, it helps us remember and know what our ancestors had left behind. And it also helps us protect the future for children who are not yet born. So in 2016, there was a notice of construction. All of our efforts went to the wayside. This company, Dakota Access Pipeline Energy Transfer Partners just kept pushing through. And when this first notice of construction started, the movement began. There's a huge movement. And it continues today. There's still a movement today. In 2016, it felt like the first time we were heard, on December 4. The Department of Army said we're not part of that. We went to court. We had to file a court case. We knew that our chances were not very good, because throughout history, federal court has never ruled for tribes. So we know that our chances-- and we know that the deck is stacked against us. We know that the federal laws are in place. We know that this company has complied with the federal laws. But yet they didn't consult us. We had an argument, when we took them to court. We wanted to take them to court. It was something that we had to do, even though we knew the deck was stacked against us. And first, we filed a temporary restraining order, saying you're going to destroy our sacred sites. Don't go through there. Company continues to work, and the judge rules in their favor. They destroy sacred sites. So all of our initial court case was on sacred sites and consultation. We lost that. But it doesn't mean that it's over. We're going to continue the fight. When the court ruled against us, the Department Interior, Department of Army, and Department of Justice wrote a memo saying, we're not going to approve of an easement for the company to cross our land, until we take a closer look at this and do some further reviews. And then, in December, 2016, they didn't grant the easement. And they said, until we conduct environment impact statement-- and that was something that we were asking for. To get approval, they will give an environmental assessment. They will get a FONSI, Finding of No Significant Impact. And they will get a 404 permit. And then, the last thing they need is an easement across the federal lands. The agency said, we're not going to give that, until we do an environmental impact statement. They put a notice in the Federal Register, notice of intent in the Federal Registry. And then, the new President took office. And the new President said, we're going to do Dakota Access Pipeline. We're going to restart KXL Pipeline. And he wrote a presidential memorandum. So we're still in court over this matter. We appealed what the judge did. And things were changing, because our complaint that we filed was starting to look like null and void, because they went and destroyed all the sacred sites. And the judge ruled, saying that we were consulted, because we had 380 correspondences with the Corps of Engineers. And those correspondences were, we're not consulting with you until we get an opportunity to share. Well, we need to consult. Well, we don't want to consult until you give us the opportunity. So we went back and forth with emails and phone calls. So in February, this month, February 8, there was-- let's see. The week before that, I was trying to get a hold of President Trump. And I've been trying different angles. I know he said that. I know what he's doing. So maybe if he just hears us-- so I was optimistic. If I just get an opportunity to get in front of him. The President said, in his presidential memorandum, he said, we're going to approve these pipelines, because it creates economic development and jobs, creates national security. And it creates energy independence. So when I hear those things, I said, perfect. I get to talk to him. And I could show him that today, we are continuing to pay that cost for those things. While this nation benefits, there's a cost-benefit. And it's bringing harm on our people. And it's going to create another. So I wanted to have the opportunity. First week of February, I finally got to talk to someone in the White House. His name's William Kirkland. I talked for an hour, said I need to sit down. I need to show you. I need to show you. I need to talk to anybody in the White House, anyone who would listen, that you cannot approve of this easement. And so he says, OK. We'll meet on February 9. February 6 is a Monday. We have a status conference on our court case. And they say not until Friday, which would be February 12 or February 10. OK, I have some time, one last chance. Make a run at it. That was February 6. February 7, I'm flying to DC to meet with William Kirkland in the White House on February 8. February 7, I get a call. I call the general. We're giving the easement. We're canceling the notice of intent for an EIS. And we're going to waive the 14 day congressional notice for the easement. So that's the call I get. And so I feel like I got slighted by this. The reason I feel like that is because we originally had our meeting set up for Monday. And then, they moved it to Wednesday. And then, I go on Tuesday. And Tuesday, they come out and let me know that. So I try to forgive. There's some lessons that I learned. And one of them is to forgive. But it's really hard when somebody does that to you. I feel like I was set up. So that's kind of where we are. And we filed a summary judgment two days ago. And our argument is that there was no change in circumstances. The Department of Army gave a notice to do an environmental impact statement. And because there's no change in status, they need to honor that. But the one question that we always ask the Corps of Engineers, and the reason why we got the environmental impact statement from the beginning was because we asked a question. We will be the first ones that are affected by it. And they couldn't. So that's when Jo-Ellen Darcy, the Assistant Secretary for US Civil Works said, we need to do an EIS. And then, this President comes in and takes away. The Administrative Procedures Act says they can't do that. So we now we are also saying we have treaty rights. We entered into this treaty. So I started talking about treaty. We have treaty rights. And those treaty rights are hunting, fishing, and our water. And those three things have been successful for tribes in the past, when we've filed claims on them. So we're pursuing those. And I believe that we have a strong argument. I know we have a strong argument. It's just going to depend on how the judge sees things. And it's crazy, because we have this billion dollar company, who's coming in acting like the victim, like we are hurting them. We are keeping their project from going. And so we're going to continue to do that. This movement has been something special. It's been something that I never anticipated. I never knew it was going to be like this. I never thought that it was going to be something this special, something this great, something this beautiful. And I know it's because-- and I believe in the creator. So it's not like God or a puppet master. It's more like everything. And I believe in that, because there's been so much prayer. In August, September, October, when you guys came, you felt it. You witnessed it. And then, I had a hard time. It wasn't easy. I have all the things that plague our people. And then, we have this movement. So 8,000 members on Standing Rock. At one time, we had 10,000 members at the camp. So 10,000 members. So that doubled our population. So I always question myself. You can ask Nicole. And I believe that the creator has been guiding me. Every time I had doubt, there was a tribe that showed up. And they shared a song. Or they shared a prayer. And they were behind me. And they gave support. So it wasn't as difficult. There is momentum there. And we can keep that momentum going, regardless of what happens. I call Facebook alternative facts. And there's a lot of things that are said. And there was implosion that took place, imploding. And I was accused of stealing-- or not stealing, selling out, taking money. Or I had a house in Florida. All this stuff was on Facebook. And it's kind of humorous to me. I don't have Facebook. There's a reason, because if I did, I would go crazy. I'm already going crazy. Ask Nicole. So I don't watch social media. I don't pay attention to it. But someone will come, and they'll show me, look at what they're saying now. Well, the sad thing is it's our own members, and it's our own people who do this. But I forgive them. And I understand, especially when it gets tough. So if I didn't love my people, I'd probably be on Facebook myself and firing back. I know what you did. So that doesn't help anybody, though, if you react to negativity. It doesn't help me, doesn't help my wife, doesn't help my kids. So I have to let it go. I have to forgive them. And I could honestly look at them in the face and not have any ill feelings towards them, anybody who says anything bad about me. So this movement is something that started Standing Rock. And it is about water. But it's also about what each and every one of us can do, because we know that this Mother Earth is in trouble. And all we have to do is look at the facts. And I'm not trying to argue. I know there's this debate about climate change and global warming. Let's just set that aside for now. The temperature of this Earth is heating up. The ice caps are melting. Glaciers are disappearing. The ocean levels are rising. Currents are changing. Coral reefs are disappearing. These are facts. So there's something happening. And so we have to make a difference. And this is what this whole thing helped me understand. And I'm guilty too. I drive a car. I wear clothing that has petroleum in it, the dyes. Everything in this-- I could look here, and I could see petroleum products. It's not our fault. I get called a hypocrite because my wife and I own a gas station. But that's because that's the only thing available. And the means of transportation for us, for our community, is our vehicles. So it's OK. But now we have to make a change. And there's movements like this all the time. I like this one. Let's change all our light bulbs, so they're incandescent light bulbs. Now I'll reduce my carbon footprint. That's not enough anymore. And just for my community, we had this hardship that is there. And it's about trying to look at the kids, invest in the kids. We have to believe in them. So when you see someone, when you see a little one, this is the change. It's so simple. Life is simple. The change is acknowledge that little one. We acknowledge the baby. Acknowledge, and you'll see them light up. And believe in them. The children are going to be the ones who make the difference. And then, we can also do things. I don't know why we have plastic bottles. There's a lot of things that we can do. But we have to start creating the demand, because this country is ran with money and greed. We have a President who is driven by money and greed. So we have to create the demand and force that change. The reason why everything is in petroleum is because-- I don't know if you know who the Koch brothers are. They own Congress and all the rules and all the policies that allow for this pipeline. So this thing that happened at Standing Rock is greater than just Standing Rock. And there's something each and every one of us can do. I used to think it was at the individual level. That's not good enough. All of you will make that change individually. And we've seen it with Las Vegas. All the light bulbs are powered with renewable energy. A community doing it. And the only way we're going to change is if we get the United States to change. So it is something that's bigger. And I do believe that the creator is driving this. And it's possible. It's doable. And instead of saying, I'm guilty. I want to say, this is what I'm doing. I walked to Ithaca. I didn't walk here. It's too far to go. But we've got to create the alternatives, so we can all drive Teslas. We have to create the demand. Electricity can be produced with sun or with wind. And I think this is a perfect place to start. I know this community, this campus is moving in that direction. So I don't want to talk. I want to let you guys ask questions. I know there's a lot of questions that you might have. And I'll answer them. I didn't talk too much about the camp. I'll tell you right now, at the camp, there are people there. My focus with the camp is to make sure that we clean it and to make sure that people are safe. It is in the area where there's a flood zone. So we're going to continue to try to make sure people are not there. And it is a real risk, because of the amount of snow that we had, the cold temperatures, and the ice damming up and creating a potential flood. And when that flood hits, if it's not clean, we become the contaminators. And we don't want that. So that's our focus. That's been our focus the past three weeks. Nicole actually was out there and helping clean up. So this is what happened. 10,000 people, December 4. December 5, the snow storm hit. 10,000 people, a lot of them from California and the southern states. So I come out, and I say, it's OK to go home. You can go home. And there was about 1,200 people left. And that's a peace of mind, because I'm not worried about all the other people. But at the same time, when they left, they didn't take everything with them. So the things that they left behind is what we're cleaning up. And I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm just saying that I'm thankful nobody lost their life. And I'm thankful for the support. I'm thankful for this community and all the tribal nations who came. It's powerful when we unite. It's powerful when a collective group come together. And when we do it with prayer, there's all kinds of lessons. And I could tell you a whole bunch of things about the lessons that I was given by the creator. But that's another whole different seminar. It would probably take twice as long. So I'll ask if you guys have any questions. Just raise your hand, and I'll try to do my best to answer them. Go ahead. SPEAKER 2: First of all, I'd like to say welcome. I'm a Cayuga woman, so welcome to our lands here. I have a lot of questions. But we just seen it on the news earlier today that there was a deadline for everyone to move from the main camp. But they said that there was still 200 people there. DAVID ARCHAMBAULT: So what's happening is there is a flood risk. And the main camp is located off Standing Rock. So Standing Rock never gave an order. And in fact, Standing Rock has always been asking that the National Guard, the Morton County Police, the state government, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs do not use force to remove people. And we've always been concerned about safety. Because we're concerned about safety, and because we're concerned about the environment, we ask people to voluntarily leave. Now, that's where the implosion takes place. There's accusations that I'm doing that because I'm helping the pipeline go through. But I'm not. I'm worried about the environment. And I'm worried about the safety. So the orders that are coming out are coming from the state government. And that land, where the big camp is, is off Standing Rock. And it's on Morton County land. And there is an argument, when it comes to treaty land, that there's treaty land and then there's federal lands. Now, the argument that we have is there's a land dispute. We never ceded that land. And this case was tried in 1980 with the Black Hills. And the judge said that this was one of the worst things that ever happened to Native Americans, but you're not going to get your land back, the 60 million or the Black Hills. So there's still a land dispute. Now, what we're arguing with our treaty rights are hunting and fishing and water. We know that those three things have been successful in federal court. We know that the land dispute-- there was an attempt to settle. And we didn't accept that. But if we start that argument up here, I have to make sure all the Great Sioux Nation is on board, because what that's doing is that's putting it at risk. And all it will take is an act of Congress to say, you have to take that money. And it's done. And you don't have nothing. So we're not going there. Now, because we're not going there, the state is going to issue these eviction notice. There are 200 people there. And I'm still maintaining don't use force. We don't want anybody to get hurt. And we're really fortunate, if you think about how everything made out that no lives are lost. DAVID ARCHAMBAULT: And I appreciate all the support. And you can continue to do it I think this pipeline is one-- as a chairman, I deal with health care and the law enforcement. I deal with welfare. I deal with education. I deal with housing. I deal with everything that you could think of. And include the pipeline in there now. And include the people. So these are all the issues that I look at. And so when I base a decision, I look at how is it going to impact everything, not just the pipeline. So this is just one. And what I see with this new President coming in, everything is going to be attacked, our economies, our health care, our education. So it's a real threat. And we have to stand up and make it go beyond this pipeline. I can't tell you how much I appreciate everybody, the non-Indians, the Indians from around the world, who came. If we focus everything on this pipeline, there's a lot of other things at risk. We have to stand up. And on March 10, we're going to rise in Washington to let this Congress know. And then, we're going to let this President, this administration know that we're still here. And we've been here. Regardless of what this country has done to us, we're going to continue to be here. And it doesn't matter which administration. If you can't go to DC at that time, you can have a movement. And I know you have movements here in support. What are some things at home that can change. And I know it's beautiful that we stand up for this. But for my community, I need my members to stand up against meth now, because meth is killing our people. I need our community to stand up against pollution. There's a lot of things that we can start standing up now. And this movement, it's an awakening. It's time now. It's time to do something and no longer sit back. I get two questions asked every time I go somewhere. But it's more like this. I'm fine. I'm good. I have prayer. I have the creator. I have my family. I'm OK. And what I say is follow your heart. You need to follow your heart. And your heart will tell you what to do. And it's that simple. Life is simple. So mni wiconi in our language, it means life giving water. So there are a lot of things that give life. And there is a tag line that says life is war. Our water is life. So if we start to interpret those three words. So if something equals something, it goes both ways. So I would say water is like. Life is water. It's a source of life. So there are many things that are sources. There are four things that are sources of life. So life to me is an experience. We are all here in a moment in time. And we are experiencing things that we have to pass on. And we need to take the lessons that we learn in this moment, pass them forward. And to me, it's precious. Life is precious. DAVID ARCHAMBAULT: No, I didn't. What I did-- KARIM-ALY KASSAM: That's enough questions from one person. Because we don't want to accuse our guests. DAVID ARCHAMBAULT: No, I'll answer that one question. And I never used BIA. What the BIA does is they are the administrators or the trustees of allotted land. And so when somebody is out of compliance with allotted land, this happens all the time. The BIA will issue a trespass order. And so I'm informed when they do things, but it's not something that I have asked for. Again, I asked that there's no force used, whenever they carry out their actions. And I've been thankful for all the support. And I appreciate everybody who has come. DAVID ARCHAMBAULT: Media. So from the beginning, there has been concern that mass media will not cover this. So there's different types of mediums to get the message out. There's different ways to tell stories. And there's radio. There's television. There's news. There's movies. And then, we have social media. So what social media did was it helped this movement go worldwide. When social media came about, people from all around the world got to see firsthand what's happening. And that also allowed for mass media to have to turn and take a look. And so we have had major networks like CNN, MSNBC. There's just different ones that came up and did a story. But it's not the media that we had hoped for. And I think some of it has to do with politics and the type of stories that they want to cover. One time, we had an interview set up with CNN. And then, something happened in North Carolina. So they left. And they didn't want to be here. What I took for granted was all media that was there was there to help with the movement, because we were not getting the attention that we're supposed to. And when I took that for granted, then I did an interview. And that's why the question came up. What they do is they take what you say, and they splice it. And they only show what they want. So it doesn't help. What it does is it creates division. And what made this movement so powerful was the unity and the togetherness. And so when I took that for granted, and these other medias came in to do interview, I assume that they were there to look good. That's OK, though. I don't hold anything against them. I don't hold anything against anyone that has a resentment towards me. I have to let it go. And I have to forgive them. And I believe that the creator's only there to help, and he's going to guide us. Go ahead. We have a lot of relatives that have gone. And we started this two years ago. And we don't have any intention in stopping, regardless of what happens. And we understood that from the beginning that there's always a chance. Even if this pipeline gets through, it doesn't mean that we're going to stop. We're always going to pursue-- we'll appeal. And we'll go as far as we can with this. We won't stop. The big camp is in a floodplain. And there is a little high ground there. But that's off. Now, the other camp that has started-- I was put in a hard position, because my intention has always been for the safety of people. And I wanted to set up an area so that people will move. And this is when it was nice. And I made that available. And then, at that time, people at the camp said, we're not moving. We're not going to move. But I still wanted to make that available. And what happened was the community of Cannon Ball passed a resolution saying, please close the camps. And that was passed, given to our tribal council. So our tribal council has to listen to the members. And then, I follow out the orders of our resolutions that are passed. So it didn't allow me to put the land aside for them. So there are some private landowners that are saying their land is available. So it really gets difficult. And people really don't understand all the things that I have to deal with. They make assumptions. And that's OK. I'm all right with that. They'll attack me. And I just-- I have to listen to our members. And I have to try to do what's best to assure that people are safe and that this environment that we are occupying is safe. KARIM-ALY KASSAM: Well, Chairman Archambault, thank you very much.

Our perception of the world depends largely on how much and how little we know. What we each think and believe depends largely on the information society has handed to us. We are all shaped by the people around us, and whatever location and culture we are born into in the world. If you were born in another place and time, your life, your thoughts, your beliefs all would be very different. Imagine if we were not given the information, the learning, the perspectives that have developed and accumulated over thousands of years. If we started from scratch, with no language, no beliefs, no rules, no thoughts or ideas about the world provided for us, and began life as a blank slate with no external input on what to think about reality, our lives would be closer to that of wild monkeys than who we know ourselves to be today. Consider how much civilization has changed in the past 100 years alone and how that has changed who we are. The life we live today is as it is because of what our ancestors learned, believed and taught to each generation, building over time throughout history. Yesterday, I talked about the importance of expanding our worldview, and to expose ourselves to more information so our perceptions of reality grows. Now, with Mercury meeting Saturn, it is a good time to consider how limited we are. Take facebook for example. The information provided to you is largely passive. As you scroll down the page, you see things other people have posted. It is not information you are actively curious about seeking. It is merely random information others have chosen to provide to you. They have all kinds of reasons for deciding how information is displayed to you - mostly to benefit their bottom line of course. Well, yesterday I read that Facebook will be implementing censorship algorithms so that the Chinese government will allow facebook to expand in China. In other words, Facebook, a corporation, is agreeing to censor people from sharing information so that it can go into China to make money advertising. But what struck me as most interesting is that I did not see any articles listed on google news, which draws on mainstream news sites, about the pipeline whatsoever, unless I did a search. The story was basically buried by other news, as if it is not very important. These are the types of things that Jupiter in Libra is bringing our attention to, truth, justice, fairness, equality, balance, particularly in the media. On a personal level, this is a time to ask yourself how your own limited perspective, is holding you back from experiencing the greater potential of your own life. Putting in the effort to seek more information that matters will open you up to a whole other reality. Intentionally choosing what you want to focus on today is rewarding.

Meanwhile, one thousand miles from Flint, water protectors at the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota are celebrating the temporary halting of construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Ironically, but not surprisingly, those obstructing access to clean water will never have to experience a life without potable water as communities in Flint are now, for the second holiday season in a row. They do not have to fight for their land. Instead, they approve lucrative business deals to build through sacred ground. Those of us who fight for social justice know that it is no coincidence that the communities bearing the burden in Flint and Standing Rock are low-wage communities of color. In both Flint and Standing Rock, majority of residents are people of color, with poverty rates three times higher than the national average. We also know too well the disproportionate impacts of these injustices on women. As a North Dakotan with indigenous American roots, the protection and the plight of native people and lands has always been important to me. As a black woman, I know all too well the direct result of silencing the voices of the voiceless. These actions and failures to act are nothing less than direct assaults on the lives of women of color. In the case of Standing Rock, those assaults have moved from creating hazardous and deadly conditions to actual physical acts and state-sanctioned dehumanization of peaceful protesters. Communities are being destroyed right now. Voices are being silenced and bodies criminalized over access to water and rights of the sovereign nation to protect their lands. Discrimination that these communities have fought long and hard against. In effect, the failure to appropriate necessary dollars to Flint and the direct actions resulting in violence against protesters in Standing Rock, is political obstruction, poisoning communities. But understanding this allows us to see clearly what the antidote is - dismantling the oppression of marginalized communities. Congress and the incoming administration must take action. Before Congress adjourns to celebrate the holidays, they should pass a budget that includes funding for Flint. The incoming administration should uphold the current decision to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline through native lands. And you can do something too. Now is not the time to sit idly by, watching as our sisters and brothers fight for the most basic of resources. We must stand with Flint and Standing Rock. We must be diligent. We must guard their wells as we would our own. If we fail to do so, we dishonor the work of our foremothers and ensure that a system that has, since its founding, been geared to benefit the few to the detriment of the many.

But the woman on the loudspeaker saw it as a tactic to try to move the water protectors out.

You can change the location at any time. It's got to be more than veterans. The uncompleted stretch of the project was set to run under Lake Oahe. In recent weeks, there was an all out call for military veterans to join the fight - a move that Flint resident Arthur Woodson said may have helped end the fight. Protesters have been fighting against the pipeline for months and have endured being shot with rubber bullets and sprayed with water in freezing temperatures by police. So far, reports say an estimated 564 people have been arrested. Woodson traveled to North Dakota on Dec. 3 to show support with fellow veterans with another Flint resident and military veteran, George F. Grundy II who said he was overwhelmed by the amount of attention the Flint water crisis had gained with supporters of the Standing Rock fight. Both Woodson and Grundy talked to community activists, veterans and Native Americans about Flint's water crisis and stressed the need to keep the national spotlight on the issue. An estimated 4,500 veterans came to Standing Rock to support the protest. Community activist Jay Ponti said momentum has been loss with the Flint water crisis and journalists need to make sure it stays relevant in the news. It's a great disservice. You cannot have a healthy democracy if the citizens are not informed. When there is no information...the citizens cannot make decisions...Our people are suffering. They are suffering in Standing Rock. They are suffering in Flint. Ponti who was covering the Standing Rock protest said he making plans to come to Flint to help with the city's water crisis. In September 2015 it was found that children in Flint had elevated blood lead levels since the city's switch from using Detroit as a water source in 2014 to the Flint River. They are poisoned.

Cannupa Hanska Luger, artist Share quote & link A lot of artists I've spoken with have described their journeys to the Standing Rock encampment as transformative. They ask you if you have weapons or drugs. This is an exclusive country. It's all about fences and borders. You set up camp and someone gives you firewood. The whole thing of guarding your stuff goes away. As you walk through the world, you are not yourself. You are not a singularity. You are not an American individualist bootstrapping bull .... You are only borrowing this place from children you will never meet. And the only reason you have an opportunity to do that is because elders took care of it for you. Everybody came in hoping to experience something new, something profound. But when they got there, they realized they're not a part of something new, they've just been absorbed into something that is much older than the entire country. That's incredibly humbling. This is our culture. It's a part of our society. Our original bible, that comes down from on high, it is the land. We have an oral tradition and we tell stories about magical characters that are bound to the landscape, that are bound to geology. There is a story. Artist Cannupa Hanska Luger on the Standing Rock protests Share quote & link The battle for the pipeline isn't over, but having the Army Corps of Engineers deny the permit certainly stands as an important victory. It was so grass roots. Native people have never been subject to that amount of solidarity. It left everybody awestruck. And the number of Native people coming together, nothing like this has been seen since the 19th century. It's far too profound. I was inspired by these activists in the Ukraine. From the photos I saw, it seemed profoundly effective. I wanted to bring that same level of recognition to the front lines there. But Standing Rock is in the middle of nowhere. So what we needed was a mirrored shield. From one sheet of Masonite, you could make six shields. I started making them after that Sunday that they were hitting people with hoses. I personally made close to 100 of them. But then another group out of Minneapolis made 500. I have no idea how many are in circulation. But I keep seeing them here and there. Being an artist, it is a way to weaponize privilege. Artists, we live on the periphery. But we are the mirrors. We are the reflective points that break through a barrier.

This is intended to widen the perspective beyond that of an arriving journalist and to give everyone a chance to show their relationship to the land and camp. Some of the people have been watching this protest unfold for months; others arrived more recently. My last meeting was with a Lakota man named Travis who lived in Pierre. At the end of our conversation, he told me that he was heading to a pipeline protest that weekend and I should come along. As far as the Lakota were concerned, this was their land, the site of their burial grounds and sacred spaces, and their main source of water. They saw the pipeline as a direct threat to their environment. Right: a teepee in the nearby Standing Rock camp. Over the next few months, thousands of people amassed in the Standing Rock camp along the banks of the Cannonball River, with tribal representatives arriving not just from across North America, but from as far away as Norway, New Zealand, and the Amazon. Having spent several years photographing the ways that the US and Canadian governments have tried to subjugate, marginalize, and assimilate First Nations peoples, it was frustrating for me to have to leave after a week. I knew I had colleagues on the ground who were doing amazing work, Native and non-Native, and realistically I knew that my presence would have been completely redundant. I focused on other projects and commitments, but kept an eye on Standing Rock. To tell the story properly, I knew I had to do something different. So instead, I turned to the residents of the Standing Rock camp, to the water protectors and local North Dakotans who had been living through this conflict for months. These are their photos, and their words. He mills all of the pieces at home in New Mexico and drives them up in a moving truck. The structure is made from wood, covered with tarp, and insulated with blankets. I went back home and it was bugging me, so I figured out how to put a yurt together. I used to work in construction and I like to build things, so it was easy for me. I brought the first one up and got it set up in about two hours, and now I've made six here. They're warm and sturdy and can fit about six to eight people. He took this photo of officers on what has become known as the front line of the DAPL protests, before various barricades were erected on Backwater Bridge. The figure in the hoodie and gas mask stared down the officers in silence. There are peaceful people, there are prayerful people, there are violent people. And I'm just here to worry about the people with violent intentions. When we looked fire hoses, well, that was a bad optic. That made us look bad. Using water was a means to remove those agitators from that situation. We stopped at the sacred fire, and I busted out my hand drums, and I knew how I could contribute. She took the photo of bison roaming freely in Theodore Roosevelt National Park over the summer. Half of them are paid to be here. But they think they're entitled to go on the Army Corps of Engineers' land and just set up camp. They think they're entitled to go on neighboring farms and ranches and run amok. Their ancestors may have been here before my ancestors, but that doesn't mean anything now. Now we all are having to suffer. I would be mad if anyone would sit here in the house and make a derogatory joke about black people. Left, Benita poses for a photo at camp. We're only here for a few days, but I'd definitely come back. At right, he poses with a fish. Even if it breaks, it's going to be beneath the river, so it'll be fine. Those protesters are saying that it's on reservation land, but it's not. Right, he paints his face in a Pueblo tradition for ceremony or times of war. I'm busy all the time. I didn't think I could make it up here. But all of a sudden I started seeing all these signs: It was always raining, I saw this amazing double rainbow, all of these things pointing to water. Every sense was telling me I had to come. Right, a photo by her shows the yurt at Pueblo Camp, which was painted by Legun Coriz. We have this connection to our land. We've all experienced similar traumas. It's that solidarity with sovereignty. It's stepping up and saying that as Native people, we're still here. I was working on a degree in environmental science and sustainability at UNM. Right, a photo that he took shows the ceremonial relighting of a sacred fire. It's been eye-opening for me. It's been an awakening. I came to bring back stories to my community about what this means, what it means to be part of this. They know there's a pipeline, but they don't really know what's going on. At left, a photo by Stacey shows her and her grandson Benjamin in Carrington, North Dakota. One of the days they came in to protest in Mandan, I was trying to take my son to dialysis in Bismarck and it took us forever to get out because they were blocking off the roads. I didn't appreciate that. I don't want to see pipelines near sacred lands. It's our water. We need to think about the next generation. At right, he takes shelter from the weather in the Standing Rock Casino, which became a base for water protectors to take an occasional break from the harsh winter weather. But for me, it's turned into a spiritual awakening. We're all going to take this home. This is going to mean something to all the other pipeline fights. At right, one of his images shows a police clash with water protectors after a man brandishing a loaded AR-15 began to threaten the crowd. And people here need help. I've seen police abuse first hand and I know if there's no evidence, it didn't occur. Without photos, it's just our word against theirs. So I'm here, and I'm taking photos. At right, a photo that he took earlier this year shows a view of Oceti Sakowin camp shortly after the Wabashaws first arrived. We had to be here. This is more important than all of us.

He was there to ask if the judge had arrived for a motion hearing that blizzardy afternoon on Wednesday, but instead was told the hearing was canceled, the charges dismissed. Twenty-five people were arrested that day. Many of those defendants face felony tampering with a public service for the events on the train tracks. Their cases are among the first felony charges to go to trial from the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Two trials already have taken place, with one acquittal and two convictions, including the first protest defendant to be convicted of a felony at trial. Cobiness, 22, is a resident of Buffalo Point First Nation in Manitoba. Her client, Rodrick Joe, was convicted of a protest-related felony at trial earlier this month. At sentencing, Harris said Joe had wanted to enter the military or a trade school. Grosinger was in a meeting and unavailable for comments Wednesday. Last winter, he left the protest camps to participate in a cross-country ride with the Mothers Against Meth Alliance. Earlier this month, seven felony defendants were bound for two trials in two days stemming from the railroad incident. Only Joe, Erica Gonzalez and Rebecca Jessee proceeded to trial. For example, Hannah Grover was bound for trial with Joe, but court documents indicate she is taking a pretrial diversion agreement. John Platner also was to join them but his trial was continued. Sarah Shomin was to be tried alongside Gonzalez and Jessee, but has indicated her change of plea. Sarah Hogarth, spokeswoman of the Water Protector Legal Collective, said late last month that about 20 defendants were set for trial this month from the railroad incident. Saylor said Wednesday he has 10 protest cases left, two of them from the railroad incident. Harris said Thursday she has 11 cases remaining, including two involving felonies, with her latest trial set for June.

We are protecting the water for our children and yours. Send one out here to negotiate. Cars were searched and impounded, personal possessions were taken by police. Lost in that day, in the horrific stories of degradation, is a small story of victory. Everyone by now has seen the videos of the assault last Thursday. But lost in that day, in the horrific stories of degradation, is a small story of victory, of how 40 to 50 Native people stood against more than 250 police on a bridge on County Road 134 in rural North Dakota. Word-of-mouth announcements went out to the Oceti Sakowin camp that there was going to be a police raid of the front-line camp that had been set up in the way of the pipeline. A raid means people are in imminent danger, and that is widely understood here. Over Labor Day, campers were attacked by dogs and pepper sprayed by Dakota Access security. My original plan was to take County Road 134 to photograph the pipeline being forced into the earth. History rarely teaches us about when Natives win against the state. Instead, I found a blockade of wood logs and hay bales set up in an area where water divided the back country road. No one there was armed with anything other than prayer. If they were stopped at this bridge from the east, they could only come from the north. In the morning, police did come, and from both sides. People began dancing to a hand drum, entranced by the power of prayer. Please. We are protecting the water for our children and yours. Send one out here to negotiate. He was met with no negotiation. But the water protectors held the bridge. For hours and hours, police advanced and retreated. This was an unforgettable moment unfolding. With the dancing going on and the veteran trying to negotiate out front, a young woman stepped up and began moving her body to the beat of the drum. She was power incarnate. Her arms were wide open, her pink fingernail polish glistening. She was crying. The untold story of this day was that those troops never made it from the east to join the others in raiding the camp, dehumanizing the friends and families of those on that bridge. History rarely teaches us about when Natives win against the state. On October 27, when a colonial force armed with military weapons faced off on a bridge against veterans armed with only prayer, the Natives won. No Paywall. No Ads. Just Readers Like You.

Tipis and sweat lodges were destroyed. Vehicles were set ablaze. More than 140 protesters were arrested. More than 140 protesters were arrested. The county sheriff is claiming the water protectors were violent and that police were stopping a riot. But hours of live video feed from people caught in the confrontation showed instead a military-style assault on unarmed people: police beating people with batons, police with assault rifles, chemical mace, guns firing rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, tasers. Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, has maintained that its citizens and supporters are engaging in peaceful, nonviolent expressions of their opposition to the pipeline. Tara Houska, national campaigns director for the Native environmental group Honor the Earth, and Thane Maxwell, an organizer with Honor the Earth, have been at the camp for months. They describe what is happening: Law enforcement from at least six other states have been involved in the assaults in North Dakota. Tell me about the law that allows this. The troops from other states (Wisconsin, Indiana, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming, and Nebraska) are sent here through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, which was designed for natural disaster situations. DeSmogBlog did an excellent, in-depth piece on this. I (Thane) am from Minneapolis, where Hennepin County Sheriff Richard Stanek has sent 30 Special Operations forces to Standing Rock. We encountered them here on the front lines on Thursday and documented their brutality against us. Tara shot footage of Hennepin County officers violently beating a man with batons that they had pulled out of the crowd. Honor the Earth has a substantial constituent base in Hennepin County, so we and our allies have pushed hard to demand the sheriff withdraw the troops. Thousands have signed petitions and attended rallies at government offices this week, and many elected officials, nonprofit leaders, and faith leaders have issued public statements calling for immediate withdrawal. But so far, we have not won. We encourage people in other jurisdictions sending troops to demand their elected officials put an end to this violence. Over 400 people have been arrested. Some are still in jail from the mass arrests on Thursday, as law enforcement makes it extremely difficult to track people, so an exact count is unknown. Yes. Elders and children have been bitten by DAPL private security attack dogs, pepper-sprayed, shot with rubber bullets, and beaten by police. One member of the International Indigenous Youth Council suffered a broken wrist from a strike with a police baton, and just a few days later an officer saw the cast and intentionally twisted her wrist to reinjure her. Arrestees have reported numerous experiences of abuse and torture while in police custody. Folks have been strip-searched for misdemeanor charges, and there are reports that women have been left naked in their cells and harassed by male guards. Others have had hoods placed over their heads, been incarcerated in dog kennels due to lack of cell space, or marked with numbers on their skin. Water protectors who locked themselves to construction equipment have also reported the use of waterboarding and pain compliance techniques such as zip-tying people in contorted positions for hours at a time. These are internationally recognized as methods of torture. I heard police are targeting medics and journalists. Yes. Journalists are often targeted during confrontations because they possess and disseminate evidence of police brutality and human rights violations. Medics are also targeted because they make it possible for protectors to continue fighting the Dakota Access pipeline on the frontlines. Arrestees have reported numerous experiences of abuse and torture while in police custody. These are recognized combat tactics, and if it were actually a war, clear violations of Geneva Convention humanitarian rules. Clearly identifiable medics have been shot in the back with less-lethal ammunition while attending to patients. On Thursday, several people saw police use batons to hit two medics who were sitting on the back of a vehicle, slowly retreating from the police line. They also pulled the driver out of the car while it was moving, and it continued into the crowd. Luckily, a bystander jumped in the car and stopped it before it hit anyone. Yes. On Thursday, I saw the police shoot many rubber bullets at a horse at point blank range. Police in ATVs also chased horses in full gallop herding buffalo towards the confrontation, and shot them with both rubber bullets and live ammunition. One horse did not survive. Arrestees have had a huge range of experiences, and it keeps getting worse. Some have been bonded out for a reasonable amount of money in just a few hours. Others have stayed in for days and been tortured and abused. Many have faced trumped-up charges and inflated bonds. This is partly an intimidation tactic by Morton County and partly an attempt to seize as many of our financial resources as possible. Almost all of the estimated 142 people arrested on Thursday are facing felony charges. Currently, a team called the Red Owl Legal Collective consults with people while in custody and prioritizes bond for those with medical conditions, immigration issues, proximity to structural violence. They bond people out as quickly as possible, and sometimes represent arrestees at bond hearings where a judge may or may not reduce the inflated bond. Hopefully none of these charges will stick, but it puts an incredible burden on the movement. At that point, a plea is entered and the defendant is expected to return again for either a pre-trial conference or a trial. All of this is of course very taxing for people who live far away and, in many cases, in poverty. We are both members of The Freshet Collective, which raises money and manages the Sacred Stone Legal Defense Fund. We work closely with the legal support team on the ground at the encampment, operating with support from the National Lawyers Guild, and we are currently seeking additional attorneys experienced in this line of work. Many other groups on the ground here support this effort, as expressed in this solidarity statement. Any remaining funds will be used in civil cases against Dakota Access, law enforcement, or other parties responsible for human and civil rights violations. Well, the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851 clearly affirmed all of this land as sovereign, unceded territory belonging to the Great Sioux Nation. But according to the current laws of the occupying colonial forces, yes, the treaty camp was on Dakota Access land and the main encampment is on Army Corps land. The Obama administration could intervene any time. So far, they have taken measured steps of delay, such as the suspension and review of Army Corps permits related to this project. But no firm answers have been given and construction of the Dakota Access pipeline has sped up. The Obama administration could intervene any time. The U.S. Army Corps has still not sent the final easement to Congress that is required for DAPL to drill under the Missouri River. We at Honor the Earth recently teamed up with the Sierra Club and the Indigenous Environmental Network to submit a letter to the Army Corps spelling out the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the National Historical Preservation Act in this situation. Since DAPL intentionally destroyed sacred sites to circumvent their protection, the Army Corps cannot legally issue any more permits. All we can tell you is that we will be here until the end, and we will do everything in our power to protect this land, this water, and all the beings who depend on it. We cannot express to you the courage, dedication, and passion in the hearts of the people. You are seeing the videos and images and hearing the stories, but you really have to be here to feel it.

On Sunday night, November 20th, temperatures were below freezing when peaceful protesters were fired on with water cannons, tear gas, and rubber bullets. We need to act now to help support their peaceful, unarmed efforts to protect their sacred sites and native homelands from the encroaching Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). In an email to Edenkeeper from Susan Stephenson, Executive Director of Interfaith Power & Light (IPL), Susan shared the beautiful experience of Minnesota IPL members participating in a prayer event with the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. Undoubtedly, one of the best ways to help is prayer. Lifting up our Native American sisters and brothers on the frontline of this crisis offers a tangible solace to our souls. Both those being prayed for and those offering the prayers are joined in a cosmic bond of compassion, invigorated by an unseen force unlimited in its ability to strengthen our resolve, patience, and energy. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard is a member of the Standing Rock Sioux of Fort Yates, North Dakota. She is a landowner impacted by the DAPL route and is one of the founders of the Sacred Stone Camp. If we are to live as a people, we must have water, without water we die. So everything we do as we stand here, we must make sure that we do it in prayer, and that we do it in civil-disobedience. We stand. But this past Sunday evening, November 20, water protectors faced an even worse onslaught of abuse as police authorities attacked again. As temperatures fell below freezing, police forces outfitted in riot gear formed a line to prevent protesters from moving. Then, careless of inflicting hypothermia on their trapped victims, police sprayed the activists with a water cannon mounted on top of an armored vehicle. Throughout the terrible attack, which lasted long into the night, mace, tear gas, rubber bullets, and concussion grenades were also used against the unarmed Water Protectors. Tara Houska, an organizer with Honor the Earth, said over 200 people had been sprayed with mace and tear gas, pelted with rubber bullets, or soaked with water. Sign the petition today asking President Obama to direct the Army Corps to deny the permit. We urge you to direct the Army Corps to deny the permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline which violates the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty, would endanger the drinking water of 10 million people, and is a risk to our climate. This pipeline will not only jeopardize the local environment in North Dakota, but by sending dangerous tar sands oil 1200 miles across the heartland of our nation, it threats many millions more. We know by now that leaks and spills are almost inevitable, and we do not believe this is a risk worth taking with our Earth and our communities. Constructing one thousand miles of pipeline through 58 counties and four states represents a long-term investment in fossil fuels. Scientists tell us we have only a few short years to transition to renewable energy and stop burning fossil fuels if we are to have any hope of keeping global warming under 2 degrees Celsius, as we committed to do in the Paris climate accord. Approving a new pipeline now, to carry the most dangerous and dirtiest form of oil, is counter to that commitment and will undermine our progress in shifting to clean energy. Therefore we implore you to revoke the permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline project entirely.

Using water cannons in below-freezing temperatures puts people at risk of hypothermia. Hundreds of protesters were hospitalized, with several in serious condition.

It is also inconceivable to think that police would fire a missile to take down an amateur drone with hundreds of innocent people below.

We keep getting cut off: I assume the weather is affecting our cell connection, but Clark tells me all his phones are tapped. He may be right. Clark was raised around the military and loved his upbringing, but he says he and his famous and dad are diametrically opposed when it comes to his involvement with the cause of the Standing Rock Sioux. I always thought I was going to serve in the military. First, I was a lieutenant, and then I became a second lieutenant. I had a great experience. I loved the men I worked with. It is not until you are an officer that things become gray. I watched it all happen from 6th Avenue and 14th Street, and everyone I worked with died. I took that big long walk home north with everyone else that day. I had just gotten out of the service, and they could have called me back. If you go, you will see your friends die, and you may lose a limb yourself; maybe you will end up killing somebody. When you come home, you will realize you got used, and you will be angry and bitter. I listened, and I watched my friends go back in and get hurt and worse. My dad was right. He and I don't agree about my going to Standing Rock, but I'm going. We put up an event on Facebook with Michael Wood Jr., and we put out an order for veterans to join us at Standing Rock. I have been on the left and the right in this country; neither party is acting in the interest of the people of the United States. We have about eight years. When the Oglala Aquifer runs out of water, it's gone. If you bought a house in Florida or own any property at sea level, 25 feet or lower, by the time you're done paying off the mortgage, no one will insure the property. We will have a ceremony with the Sioux tribe on the morning of Dec. 5. Some members of Congress will be there, like Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Then we'll have a press conference, and the rest of us will mobilize to execute the multiple contingency plans we have come up with. There is a waiting list of veterans who want to join the peacekeeping activities. We are out there to help, to do good and to put our bodies on the line to try and help save this country. My sons are worried about my safety. No one is being paid a dime to stand out there and get beaten up. We will follow the example of Gandhi or Martin Luther King and turn the other cheek. People join the military, police and fire departments because they want to help people. We all take an oath when we join up to protect the Constitution of the United States from enemies foreign and domestic. This government has run roughshod over constitutional law, especially in the last 16 years. We are doing what the actual terrorists want. We are breaking our own values, disobeying the Constitution, spying on people's emails and phone calls, putting people on no-fly lists and restricting their travel. We have officers who can confiscate cash from people that they pull over. I want to create a future for my children. I just want a job that pays the bills. I tried meditation, I tried to pursue religion. I'm no Jesus: I've been a sinner. The most important things in life are kindness, compassion, honesty, caring for neighbors. Most important is forgiveness. I want forgiveness. We are raised in America to be spectators. Life is about living not watching other people do it. Everyone is going to Standing Rock with the same idea. We will not stop until this country gets it right, until we live by our proposed ideals.

It is these phenomena which help model an ideal society. Everyone engages in participatory roles that contribute to a common goal. She further reasoned that people want to make a difference and alleviate the current situation during these times. Memorable protests throughout history were named, including the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong for universal suffrage and Arab Spring in Tunisia to protest a political regime. This protest camp in Washington had a medical clinic as well as access to education, shelter and food for all participants. Here was another example of the people creating an ideal society of their own. Addressing another issue, Fiskio explained that the protests are not anti-institutional, for people could not create the results needed if that were so. Occupy Wall Street, for example, was not about tearing the bureaucratic institutions down, Fiskio said, but rather a movement that exemplified a caring, just society speaking for what they believed in. The Tar Sands Healing Walk in 2010 was discussed. This was a peaceful demonstration to acknowledge the people, air quality and wildlife affected by the Athabasca Oil Corporation in Alberta, Canada. The significance of this event can be traced in the simple, everyday act of walking. This march communicated decades of exploitation and suffering received by the local First Nations people, where water contamination, food security and disease were key issues. It can happen in a garden, in classrooms, or in the work space. During a discussion following the presentation, Michael Omps posed a question regarding issues today. Omps said. Fiskio reasoned, it is not that we need to think in that mindset. There are different strategies for being effective in different ways. They were going through the Supreme Court. They were going through the state system. They were using boycotts. Among the audience was Dr. Fulbert Namwamba, a professor of environmental studies at Southern University in Louisiana. We are watching things happening. There is no fantasy. Namwamba further stated that there are three things necessary to create change. The first one is the use of knowledge, for that will always be present. The second is being able to use science, and third is the need to organize. Among the stifling of the EPA and loose regulations for fossil fuel industries, knowledge will always be there to provide substantive evidence. Several members of the audience remained to speak to Fiskio following her insightful presentation. Massey is an environmental and political science major at Salisbury University. This presentation offered great information about the history of protests, the implications of those movements and the knowledge to be gained in the current climate of political activism. but there was an error posting your comment."}, {"URL": "http://www.justicenewsnetwork.com/now-is-the-time-to-dig-in-at-standing-rock/", "Timestamp": "20180919002350", "Sentences": "Register for an account A password will be e-mailed to you. If you are one of those people that believes that the Standing Rock protest is over and that the protesters should all go home, you are one of those people that needs to check again. Further, it is also true that they are swiftly approaching their construction deadlines to retain their contracts with the various oil companies that they are working with. However, this does not mean that the battle is over. This is the power of nature. It is very difficult for construction equipment to dig under earth that is frozen solid and covered with six to ten feet of snow. This is very important to make note of, but it is more important to make note of the fact that this also cannot be taken as meaning that the battle is over. There is, yet, something else that is also important to make note of, however. Just one day before the Army Corps of Engineers was ordered to stand down, a whole slew of American Military Veterans showed up at Standing Rock, and in an extremely emotional, and frankly, surprising display, they apologized, directly to the Elders of the Standing Rock Lakota Tribe, for all of the past evils committed against the Lakota by the United States and its military personnel. Even more emotional, and extremely important, is the fact that they then swore their allegiance to the Lakota and their cause at Standing Rock. It is not a coincidence that the very next day, construction on the pipeline was halted. The government would have had an extremely hard time explaining to the American people why they fired on, assaulted, or arrested American War Heroes. There is no doubt that this is a massive victory because this delay gives the Standing Rock Lakota the opportunity to prepare for the lengthy court battles that they will soon find themselves entangled in. It is not as if the DAPL is just going to give up on construction of the pipeline. They have millions of dollars invested in the project. They are going to use every resource in their arsenal to ensure that construction continues as soon as it is possible, no matter how much harm it may cause to the Lakota at Standing Rock. If it is a lengthy court battle that they believe that they can better afford than can the Tribe, which will win the day for their profit margins, they will use that tool to its fullest possible extent. What this means is that the DAPL is not going anywhere anytime soon. They are going to have their equipment and an appropriate compliment of guards and workers camped out right next to the last work site, waiting and ready to restart construction just soon as they are given the go. Though, lengthy legal cases could hurt their cause; as well, people need to realize that the American legal system is extremely friendly to multi-million dollar corporations. There are multiple hardship delays and extensions that the DAPL can and is already applying for, which means that they may very well be able to get an extension on their deadlines. The extensions will either give them the time that they need to wait until the earth is unfrozen, or they will give them the time that they need to wait until Donald Trump, who has already shown his support for the pipeline, takes action. He has promised to help them get back on track; so, all the DAPL really needs to do is stall for time. So, to anyone who is encouraged to help the Standing Rock Lakota defend their lands, please, do not be fooled into going home early, not coming, or into to delaying that shipment of badly needed equipment or supplies. It is true that the Chairman of the Tribe, Dave Archambault II, encouraged a lot of people to go home, but he was not encouraging them to go home because the ordeal was over. He was encouraging them to go home, or stay away, because the weather at Standing Rock is not going to be friendly for a little while. The Northern Great Plains Region of the United States can reach Tundra conditions during this time of year. He was looking out for the health and well-being of people who are not accustomed to that type of harsh weather. He and other members of the Council have made it clear that if people are willing to stay and commit to the arduous work that is surviving in that kind of weather, they are more than welcome to remain or make their way to the camps. However, it is the opinion of this writer that the Tribe needs to call for as many reinforcements as they can, long before that ever happens. Starting now would be more than appropriate. If you can survive the cold, get there, and help them make all of the necessary preparations for the next round of encounters. History has shown that conflicts like this do not end until there is an absolute winner. The better that the Tribe is prepared now, the more likely it will be that they will be able to outlast the corporation when Spring comes. I am a Veteran. I am college educated. I am fighting for survival."}, {"URL": "http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/opinion/at-standing-rock-and-beyond-what-is-to-be-done.html?_r=0&referer=https://www.google.com/", "Timestamp": "20180919002543", "Sentences": "We were facing Dakota Access Pipeline workers threatening us with baseball bats and wrenches, one of whom had only moments ago sped his large truck through our ranks.

They have been edited for wider publication and accessibility. Read more I. At the same time, fascism is an even more grotesque and openly murderous form of this same system, representing horrors for humanity and the planet, beyond what this system already inflicts every moment. The communist revolution aims to get rid of the capitalist-imperialist system and replace it with a radically different economic and political system, socialism. As a form of rule, fascism resolves the contradiction between the essence and appearance of bourgeois democracy by exercising this class dictatorship of the bourgeoisie in its naked form. The capitalist-imperialists can enforce their system and its dominance through either bourgeois democracy or fascism, even as they may differ sharply as to what is the necessary and desirable means at a given time. They have advanced fascist mass mobilization around these themes. For many years now, Bob Avakian has pointed to the rise of fascist trends and a definite fascist movement in U.S. political life. Bob Avakian (BA) is the Chairman of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA. He is the architect of the new synthesis of communism, a whole new framework for human emancipation on a thoroughly scientific foundation. For more, we encourage readers to read and engage THE NEW COMMUNISM, by Bob Avakian and other works of BA, along with the interview with award-winning scientist and advocate for BA's new communism, Ardea Skybreak, Science and Revolution: On the Importance of Science and the Application of Science to Society, the New Synthesis of Communism and the Leadership of Bob Avakian. They are available on this website, revcom.us. BA leads the revolution in the U.S., theoretically and practically. And Why Clinton and the Democrats Are No Answer, and (b) the compilation of excerpts in The Coming Civil War and Re-polarization for Revolution in the Present Era. And theocratic Christian fascism is a critical dimension of this. In a large section of the world, U.S. imperialism is bogged down in wars for empire, locked in struggle with the historically outmoded forces of Islamic jihadism, even while they mutually reinforce each other in a dynamic that is deadly and oppressive to hundreds of millions. The U.S. faces challenges from China as a rising economic and military power, and inter-imperialist rivalry with Russia and Europe. The warming of the planet has growing and long-term implications, including mass migration from the oppressed nations which are disproportionately affected. In this society, the oppression of Black, Latino, and other oppressed nationality people, of women, and of immigrants intensifies, even while the traditional social fabric is strained by changes in demographics, the role of women, and gender and sexuality norms. Imposing this fascist program on society requires going after and replacing the norms and institutions of bourgeois democracy, especially those that pose obstacles to them like the press, the judiciary, and other sections of the ruling class. This is the dynamic of the fascist juggernaut. The imposition of different and more oppressive cohering norms in society, the escalated, violent, and viciously cruel attacks on sections of people, the trampling of civil and legal rights, the mobilization of violent fascist social bases, require, contribute to and are part of this dynamic and momentum of the fascist juggernaut. II. Resistance, protest, and outrage among the people have been and continue to be a feature from the very beginning of this regime. We have to learn from these, to lead what is needed. In assessing and understanding this moment, it is similar to the time period between Hitler being appointed chancellor and the consolidation of fascist rule where the Nazis had crushed the opposition. At this moment the former is principal and the latter fundamental. This is integral to everything we need to be doing and to actually even succeed in this crucial political battle... in line with what is ultimately needed to get to a radically different and far better society through revolution. III. It needs to be replaced and superseded, however, not by an even more grotesque and more openly murderous form of the same system, but by a radically new society, and a radically different kind of state, that will open the way and lead finally to the abolition of all forms of oppressive and repressive rule and all relations of domination and exploitation, throughout the world. First, this orientation highlights the even greater import of projecting a radically different and far better society that is represented in concrete and visionary form in the Constitution for the New Socialist Republic in North America (CNSRNA), authored by Bob Avakian. Particularly at a time when the question of how society should be organized, and on what principles, is much closer to the surface, this needs to be much more widely known. Second, this orientation stands in contrast to a position or orientation, historically characterized as United Front against Fascism (UFAF), which was dominant in the international communist movement in the 1930s in response to the rise of Nazi Germany. This line fundamentally divorced fascism from the capitalist-imperialist system, ultimately drawing too sharp a distinction between the democratic, antifascist section of the bourgeoisie and the reactionary section of the bourgeoisie for whom fascism was a response to and resolution of underlying contradictions. All this stands in opposition to leading the masses of people in independent historical action to achieve a crucial objective short of socialist revolution, with the overall strategic perspective and goal of working towards a radically different future embodied in that revolution. In this, there is an aspect common with UFAF, but this aspect in common is very secondary to the fundamental differences in approach, orientation, and goals. This is therefore relative, and contingent on an objective situation in flux. IV. This is first and foremost. When people understand this and become convinced, all sorts of things become possible with people doing all kinds of things, taking initiative, with creativity and defiance. This is what is needed, on a growing mass scale. Living, compelling agitation on this is critical, in person and even more on social media and online. The more this case is made and becomes a reality, the more people will grasp the necessity and feel compelled to act to do so. With the right orientation of unity-struggle-unity, we need to make the case to drive out this regime because fighting rearguard actions against the fascist juggernaut are incommensurate with its dynamics, not only because (a) the horrors qualitatively accentuate and accelerate but (b) there is a weakening basis to fight. To fundamentally win this on a societal basis, there is a need for, and openings for, ideological struggle. articles, related memes, etc. that expose all this. The more this is out there, the more it sets favorable terms for the struggle that is needed. This is strategically very, very favorable ground, including provoking big questions on, in short, the 5 Stops and the 3 Things4, to which we have thoroughly scientific answers. In this context, especially on campuses, among the intelligentsia and artists, and in the middle strata overall, grappling with and even sharply struggling around the questions of epistemology to make a breakthrough is critical. Obstacles are approached differently in this context, bullshit included. This has to be the orientation, setting and re-setting terms, not letting the terms get set by answering every question posed, questions that objectively represent a bourgeois or petite bourgeois outlook. The best of what is done is far from enough. We need an impatience grounded in science... - Training people to be strategic commanders of the revolution. 2) People have to dig seriously and scientifically into how this system of capitalism-imperialism actually works, and what this actually causes in the world. 3) People have to look deeply into the solution to all this. What people think is part of objective reality, but objective reality is not determined by what people think. These two guidelines are gone into during the opening chapter of THE NEW COMMUNISM by Bob Avakian and refer to the need for communists to root themselves both in the objective need of the seven billion people on the planet for a whole new world, coming from those interests in everything, and to proceed from and apply the scientific method, and nothing less, in making revolution. and Revolution Send us your comments.

The Indigenous People's Power Project, a group of indigenous organizers from around the world, ran the training every day at 2 p.m. The victory at Standing Rock didn't happen haphazardly. It happened because organizers understood that effective protest is a learned skill. With a series of daily training sessions, the organizers at Standing Rock taught excited volunteers a traditional model of activism based on organization, leadership and discipline. The organizers at Standing Rock say it's time to bring that approach to sovereignty struggles across the country. There's always the risk that youthful zeal and righteous anger could cause things to pop off. All the police would need in order to escalate their use of force would be one good excuse. After learning how to handle an afternoon on the front lines, wash pepper spray out of another person's eyes and deal with legal matters if you're arrested, other trainers would lead the group outside to practice protest formations and how to form human barricades. Tweet The informal course was based on work by the Ruckus Society, an organization that helps activists with nonviolent protest training and tactics when called upon to help. The Indigenous People's Power Project is an offshoot of Ruckus, built to visit communities like the Lakota Sioux people of Standing Rock and offer their services, which includes building custom activist training based on a community's needs. Ruckus often holds training camps that go on for up to a week at a time, but the constant influx of new hands at Standing Rock required something more light and flexible. It's not about sending people to jail. Oceti Sakowin Camp had a robust schedule of daily programming, updated throughout the day on white boards around the camp. At 9 a.m. each day was general orientation, where volunteers who just arrived learned the camp rules: no photographing sacred fires and ceremonies. And, the camp values: be of service, put indigenous people at the center. And at 6 p.m. were the meetings about decolonization, a word that's bubbling up into the mainstream a lot now that indigenous struggles are back in the news. Before the declaration of victory on Sunday, the camp was receiving hundreds of new visitors a day, packing each of these sessions to the brim. By the time December came around, it was clear to the organizers the camp's population had more volunteers and guests than it did indigenous people. The trainers at Standing Rock emphasized that this means putting indigenous people back at the center, and for white allies to ask themselves how they can be of service. Lungo said. It's our job as outsiders to check ourselves. There were over 127 cases of hypothermia, and tribal elders asked the visitors and nonessential protestors to head home, at least for the harsh North Dakota winter. With brutal winds battering the tents and small structures at Oceti, hundreds of people evacuated for their own safety. Tweet But Standing Rock isn't the only fight, and the point of training people in organizing and tactics is building a network of leaders so that those who stood at Standing Rock can take the fight home with them. Even as the protest will likely rage on in North Dakota, activists at home focused on the banks behind the pipeline project, like Citigroup and Wells Fargo, protesting at offices and keeping bank employees from entering their buildings.

And since today is Thanksgiving, I'd like to pay homage to the Indigenous people resisting a destructive pipeline in North Dakota that is threatening ancient burial grounds, clean water, and our shared environment. Ah, Thanksgiving. And now, with violence escalating at Standing Rock as Indigenous people of this land (whose genocide marks the day's festivities) continue to resist militarized occupation, the whole thing is infinitely more ironic. And disgusting. So, naming that and moving forward, I hope to use this space on JooJoo Azad today to share a few ways Indigenous people are asking for support: today, tomorrow, and the day after. Happy Thanksgiving. There are already far too few journalists covering what is happening at Standing Rock. And when they do come, they have been targeted and met with rubber bullets. Or, they just stay away completely and report from their sky-rise offices in NYC. Rather, learn about what's happening through live streams and reporting coming straight from those on-the-ground photographing, videographing, writing, documenting, and analyzing. Listen to first-hand accounts and reports that come from Indigenous people. She has traveled to Standing Rock several times herself, and when she's back in Chicago she frequently shares live-streams on her Twitter account during attacks or moments of high tension. Her Twitter is a great place to keep updated with her work and follow her writing and documentation. Monetary donation is incredibly important, despite not always feeling so. Rather than adding additional bodies that need guidance and instruction, fund work that's already happening. Or fund an indigenous person to go instead. I do want to name that not everyone can afford to boycott Black Friday, and I do not want to shame those who are unable to boycott due to financial reasons. their own businesses) (only). So, if using a militarized police force to respond to peaceful protesters isn't valuable in and of itself to draw attention to a major crisis, then it only makes sense to turn to what will. (This is a political fashion blog of sorts, after all). One of these rad Indigenous-designed clothing brand is NTVS Clothing, whose t-shirt design was the cover image for this post. Because they're that good. They have a whole dope t-shirt line dedicated to Standing Rock, and donate proceeds of their profits to the camp as well. Also, they came out with a freaking Indigenous emoji pack. Their work is political, unapologetic, and inspired by their roots (and resistance). Agitate. i.e. the man who is sending militarized police to unarmed and peaceful protesters. His number is 701.328.2200. Call him. Leave him a voicemail. Do it again. Send it to your friends. His address is 600 East Boulevard Avenue, Bismarck, ND 58505-0100. Send him poop. (but his address is still there, wink wink hint hint). Prove it. Call him. The White House's number is 202-456-111 or 202-456-1414. Tell him to rescind the North Dakota Access Pipeline, which is incredibly harmful to the environment beyond just Standing Rock. 6. Talk. Again, it might not be physically, mentally, or emotionally safe for you to confront your racist aunts and uncles, so without shaming those who are unable to, please understand how important it is to be bringing up politics over Thanksgiving. Your family will listen to you before they listen to others. Your family will reason with you before giving my words a chance.

According to Native News Online, close to 500 people had gathered for the prayer service at the time of the attack. Although no one was hit by the gunshots and they were not captured on the video below, multiple shell casings were recovered from the scene. Our protectors were peacefully marching on a dirt road towards a DAPL operations base. There were no initial reports of any pipeline workers being arrested or questioned by police, despite the fact that the incident was reported. However, peaceful protesters and journalists have been regularly assaulted, tased, pepper-sprayed and arrested for doing absolutely nothing. Protesters are often criticized for blocking roadways and creating an inconvenience for people. However, it is important to realize that when people protest, it is usually because circumstances in their lives have gotten so bad that they have no other choice. People in this position are often left with no option but to protest in a way that inconveniences people, and forces them to recognize the struggles of those around them. As we reported last week, there is evidence that the Dakota Access Pipeline is even more dangerous than typical pipeline projects, because it is slated to run under a river that millions of people depend on for drinking water. The pipeline is also in the direct path of a landslide zone, which could cause obvious and disastrous complications. Having the water supply of millions poisoned, and land stolen from natives who have suffered centuries of ongoing oppression and genocide is a huge deal when compared with someone getting home from work on time. Also, this truck driver is not an innocent bystander, as a worker on the pipeline, he is a part of the problem. This fact may upset some people in the industry, but regardless of our jobs, every individual is responsible for their own actions, and everyone has the ability to refuse orders if their job puts them against humanity.

Going from a life of upper-middle class privilege to a time spent with the huddled masses taught... View all posts Vault 7 to Deep 6: Secrecy, Mendacity and Complacency Destroyed Our Republic By Teodrose Fikre on March 8, 2017 Our Republic died a long time ago. The universal rule of revolutions held true with America as well; all revolutions devolve right back to the tyranny that gave birth to it. We are led by crooks and con artists; from our carnival barking president Trump whose maturity matches his hand size to our criminal congress that passes laws that applies to all except legislators, calling our Republic a banana is an insult to North Korea. What you will find is a document dump from Wikileaks that will shock your conscience. The conspiracy is one that is being committed by our own government against us, the common people. The truth is getting out; what the powerful have always feared is an awakening from the masses because people can only take so much iniquity and unfairness before they eventually rise up against their tormentors. The gentry learned from the past for the history is full of one example after another of revolutions that were birthed by totalitarianism. One has to only look back to the French Revolution to understand what the aristocracy fear the most. In the case of the French Revolution, the overthrow was as violent as they came as the gilded class was treated to guillotines and bloody lapels. In order to sidestep this gory consequence, the powerful focused their energies on misdirection and mass manipulation. After all, a government does not possess enough weaponry to forcefully put down a rebellion of 300,000,000 people. Even if they had the means to subdue the masses through bullets and bombs, they knew that the military and police force would not unleash hell on their own neighbors and fellow citizens. Parenthetically, this is the brilliance of the founders for having a police force that is not federalized and why the constitution forbids the military from being deployed domestically. A decentralized police force prevents forces from one state being state to another. Maybe more people should rethink about the ongoing efforts, initiated by Obama and continuing through Trump, to effectively federalize our police through the tentacles of the Department of Justice. The plutocrats have steady been chipping away at our rights and our freedoms for a very long time. A creeping autocracy takes root and gains momentum through patient planning and ruthless use of force that can be washed away with talking points and well crafted speeches. Our politicians in this light are nothing more than front men and capos acting as a diversion for the mafioso bosses who are the true overseers of our nation. We are perpetually fighting over Democrats and Republicans in DC when in reality the ones who set the agendas and control the politicians we vote for are the plutocrats who live in places like Jamestown, RI and Needham, MA to oversees destinations like Brussels and Zurich. Rich pricks, using their ill gotten billions, have deployed their bank accounts to initiate a hostile takeover of our nation and most of the planet. Eisenhower warned us a long time ago to be leery of the military-industrial complex; his dire prediction seem quaint because a military-financial monster is now consuming the entire world with a combination of bullets, bombs, and debt. In the process, they have turned America and most of the world with it into one big pyramid scheme where wealth flows from the masses to a tiny few who thrive as the rest of a shrivel. Rest in peace opportunity and pursuits of happiness, instead we are left hope sandwiches and distress. It is in order to hide this truth from us, to paint over injustice with the pretense of patriotism and freedom, that our government expends the most energy on. Imagine that, what our government fears the most is the people waking up to the bullshit of it all. The mainstream media is to free press as Barack Obama was to change. I swear we are living in one big Truman Show, up is down and down is up as media has been weaponized in order to manipulate our thinking and to submerge the citizenry in a perpetual state of outrage and acrimony. You see, when everything is an outrage then nothing is an outrage. Sensationalism is not only a good business model to get more clicks, there is a darker side to the mainstream media as they are intentionally stoking animosity and grievance into the populace in order to keep us in a constant state of rage. In case anyone wants to dismiss the power that media has over our daily lives, there was a time the press started to report about shark attacks on a daily basis. There are more than 300,000,000 of us living in America, on a daily basis someone is most likely getting bit by a shark. Those who own the gun rule by fear but those who own the media and information rule through capitulation. All the while, the true powers that run this nation, the malignant suits in various agencies throughout DC and their bosses on Wall Street, are running our lives with iron fists befitting of Pol Pot. In fact, terrorism overseas is funded and armed by the political appointees at the Pentagon, at Langley Park and the NSA who create foreign monsters in order to justify their continued power grab domestically. Just for the record, the same way I refuse to blame our veterans and active duty personnel responsible for the immoral wars that our bankrupt government keeps declaring for the sake of corporate profits, neither will I blame the men and women who work at the Pentagon and various intelligence agencies for the heinous acts outlined in the Vault 7 documents. We have to separate the workers from those who sit at the table of power. There is a vast gap between the bosses and those who are employed by the endless civil and defense agencies who, for all intent and purpose, act as a shadow government within our government. After all, not too long ago I too worked as a consultant for Booz Allen Hamilton where I provided IT and logic support to endless agencies throughout the Pentagon and Department of Treasury. If I blame CIA workers for Vault 7, then I have to take the blame for the Iraq war. The saner course is to understand that a paycheck makes slaves out of all of us. All of us are, in this way, part and parcel of the continued nullification of our nation and we too are to blame for the death of our democracy. It is complacency that has led us to give up our freedoms for the sake of security and in the process we have let our minds be hijacked by a fatuous president Trump, the clowns in congress and the sideshow pundits on TV. We need to stop fighting each other and instead unite to take on an enemy within that sees all of us, the people, as a threat to their depraved existence. What we need is a paper napkin revolution, not a revolution of guns but a revolution based on unity and love. We keep trying revolutions based on bullets and we end up right back in the embrace of tyrants. The tyrants are them, the politicians, pundits and their plutocratic masters. The target is us, the people. Or we can finally wake up as a people before we are the ones who end up in guillotines as the powerful lop off our heads with yet another economic crash like they did in 2007. When it comes to finding truth in this world that is getting drowned by a tsunami of lies, everything has to be taken with a grain of salt. What I basically have to assume is this: when it comes to those who are afforded proximity to power and accorded a megaphone by the corporate owned media, you have to assume are part and parcel of the system of disinformation. The truth is that we are being water tortured, drip by drip, into an age of neo-totalitarianism. In the meantime, we are witnessing in real time a collusion between the mainstream media, our government and corporatists as there is a conspiracy of silence in order to keep the citizens shrouded in ignorance. This is how the farce of political adversaries gets torn asunder when both parties in DC are being mum in the face of the damning facts. To all Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren fans, please understand that those two are to truth tellers as Sara Palin is to the Mensa club. Instead the tools in DC, from Democrats to Republicans, are either being silent hoping this all goes away by the next news cycle or pretending to be outraged like a clownish Captain Renault that there is spying going on in DC. What a joke, the fourth estate is no more as they have become a bunch of juvenile jackasses chasing retweets instead of speaking truth to power. Our politicians are engaged in theatrics befitting of WWE wrestling. Meanwhile our government continues to commit atrocities throughout the world in our names and continues spying on Americans. We either reclaim our government from the clutches of despots in dark suits and red ties or the noose will continue getting tighter and tighter around our collective necks. Let the audacity of Ethiopians, Haitians, and American uprising serve as a lesson to us and those who rule through division. A published author and prolific writer, a once defense consultant was profoundly changed by a two year journey of hardship and struggle. Going from a life of upper-middle class privilege to a time spent with the huddled masses taught Teodrose a valuable lesson in the essence of togetherness and the need to speak against injustice. Originally from Ethiopia with roots to Atse Tewodros II, Teodrose is a former community organizer whose writing was incorporated into Barack Obama's South Carolina primary victory speech in 2008. He pivoted away from politics and decided to stand for collective justice after experiencing the reality of the forgotten masses. His writing defies conventional wisdom and challenges readers to look outside the constraints of labels and ideologies that serve to splinter the people. Teodrose uses his pen to give a voice to the voiceless and to speak truth to power. Update: My open letter to Congress in defense of Democracy and justice by clicking...

Although it makes sense that the less experience a person has operating an automobile, and the more you do drive can statistically increase the likelihood of a motorist becoming involved in an accident, both groups of people have no physical handicaps that would reduce reaction time or result in the person being a potential danger on the public roads. However, elderly drivers often times do have physical limitations in eye-sight, reaction time and overall motor skills, something that could be a recipe for disaster for both the elderly driver and the other motorists sharing the roadways. This is way some people are proposing that the Department of Motor Vehicles require elderly drivers to take written, behind-the-wheel and eyesight tests more frequently than the average motorists in an effort to show they still have the abilities to operate a vehicle safely. GPS Tracking Systems: Giving Elderly Drivers A Choice It is important to recognize that all older or senior drivers are not bad drivers, however it is also important to note that elderly drivers do not usually have the same physical abilities as teen drivers or average drivers. The only thing that some people are calling for is a law that results in a increase in the frequency of testing for elderly drivers to make certain that a senior still has the tools necessary to operate a motor vehicle. The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) could place seniors into three different categories: 1) Driver who meets all safe driving standards to operate a vehicle safely 2) Driver meets some safe driving standards to operate a vehicle safely, and therefore should be monitored for 30-60 days via GPS tracking technology to ensure they have the skills to operate a vehicle safely 3) Driver does not meet safe driving standards and should have license suspended Drivers who would be required to have a GPS vehicle tracker system installed to their automobile would then be monitored by the DMV to check that safe driving speeds are being adhered too, and that the senior driving is not operating a vehicle more frequently than they should be. The data from the GPS tracking device would be reviewed by the DMV where it would be determined whether the senior either be issued a valid driver's license or have driving privileges suspended. Many families are now using elderly tracking systems to oversee driving behaviors and habits of senior family members to enhance personal safety. All Rights Reserved.

This is an historic moment. Our Treaties and our human rights were ignored, our interests in protecting lands and waters were considered unimportant, and our voices were not heard. It was this shared history that led Tribes to come together as never before to seek the protection of our waters against the threat of the Dakota Access pipeline. With peace and prayer, indigenous people from hundreds of Tribes said: our future is too important. We can no longer be ignored. The goal was to protect these sacred waters, and to do so in the name of our children. My thanks to the Obama Administration, and particularly to Assistant Secretary Darcy, for upholding the law and doing the right thing. At Standing Rock, our youth played an important role in spreading our message and I am so proud of what they have been able to accomplish. But Standing Rock could not have come this far alone. Hundreds of tribes came together in a display of tribal unity not seen in hundreds of years. And many thousands of indigenous people from around the world have prayed with us and made us stronger. I am grateful to each of you. My thanks to all of our allies, here and around the world, each of whom contributed to this effort. I want to give a special mention to the veterans who have come to Standing Rock in recent days. I am sure that the strength of your message in support of Standing Rock, and the rights of the Water Protectors, had a powerful impact as the Army made its decision. I appreciate all you have done. While today is a great day, there is still much that needs to be done to protect Tribal rights and ensure justice for indigenous people everywhere. Using peace and prayer as our guideposts, and with the teachings of our elders and with inspiration from our youth, I believe there is much we can accomplish for the future.

She wanted to go to trial on Friday. Twenty-one hours before Redway's trial, Grosinger moved to dismiss. Judge Allan Schmalenberger granted it. Redway's case closely resembles dozens of other cases from Oct. 22 that have been dismissed in recent weeks, often shortly before trial. Grosinger then re-charges the protester with a more serious offense and issues an arrest warrant. Redway, who traveled to Bismarck this week from Rhode Island to stand trial, now faces three new charges, which were filed with an arrest warrant on May 24. Shively said Grosinger never alerted her to the new case. Rather, he issued an arrest warrant, which she found by searching the court records. Grosinger did not respond to a phone and email request for comment on Thursday or Friday. On Oct. 22, several people locked themselves to Dakota Access Pipeline equipment in Morton County. In solidarity, a group of more than 200 people marched towards the site across private property. Police allege the protesters ripped survey stakes from the ground and yelled at law enforcement when they were told to leave. A total of 126 protesters were arrested and charged with criminal trespass and engaging in a riot, when police surrounded the group. Police have characterized the incident as a riot, but Redway said people thought of it more as a prayer walk or even a picnic, and some brought their dogs along. She said police used mace and batons, causing panic within the group. Many people from out-of-state have taken guilty pleas. The state has offered deals, which include no jail time and forfeiture of bond. Recently, they have also offered pretrial diversions, according to Shively. The six-person jury found Dakota Luke, 27, guilty of criminal trespass and engaging in a riot and co-defendant Emmalyne Garrett, 33, was just found guilty of criminal trespass. Jury members made up their minds in less than 20 minutes, according to Harris, who is Luke's attorney. Harris said the state argued that walking together in the group constituted participating in a riot. Both are re-charged with three new misdemeanor crimes from the same date.

Larijani was appointed by the supreme leader, cannot be summoned by MPs for questioning and is not directly accountable to the public. This week Arash Sadeghi, a student activist serving a 15-year prison sentence, ended a 71-day hunger strike over the detention of his wife, Golrokh Ebrahimi Iraee, after she was released on bail. Iraee had been sentenced to six years for writing an unpublished fictional story about stoning to death in Iran. Amnesty said Sadeghi had lost 20kg (44lbs) while on hunger strike, and it called on Iran to provide him with urgent specialised medical care for a kidney malfunction. Other prisoners remain on hunger strike. Saeed Shirzad, who is in jail for protesting against child labour, and Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese citizen and IT expert accused of spying for the US, are also on hunger strikes. Tara Sepehri Far, of Human Rights Watch, echoed Ebadi in condemning Larijani. Larijani belongs to an influential family and he is seen as a potential candidate to succeed the supreme leader, Ayatollah Alli Khamenei. Recently Rouhani and Larijani have been at odds over financial transparency. In November an Iranian MP questioned a minister over allegations that Larijani possessed 63 personal bank accounts filled with public funds. The judiciary later attempted to arrest the MP but was unsuccessful. Larijani has denied the allegations."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/250669646t?referring_akid=.871821.LiXDVW", "Timestamp": "20180919005817", "Sentences": "Credo Action Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument.

The other is more difficult to see unless you visit the camp itself, where old friends and long estranged tribes have reunited, and people share songs, prayers, and stories as they articulate a future in which tribal lands are no longer national sacrifice zones and the zero-sum logic of industry is not taken for granted.

The law also requires police to report allegations of child prostitution to county child welfare agencies. Advocates of the law say it will help child victims of sex trafficking get treatment rather than sending them to juvenile hall and tagging them with a rap sheet for prostitution. Pimping and pandering will still be against the law whether it involves running adult women or young girls. But legalizing child prostitution will only incentivize the increased exploitation of underage girls. Upon completion of the programs, child sex victims are cleared of charges.

Wednesday, February 8, 2017 The Real Reason President Trump has not received any Phone Calls regarding Dakota Access Pipeline I normally check my Twitter feed every morning to catch up on the latest news, opinions and events that happened throughout the night. This morning I saw a tweet by ABC News embedded with a video of President Trump responding to questions regarding the US Army Corps of Engineers announcement that they intended to approve the final easement and allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross the Missouri River less than a mile above the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. Usually, if I do something it's like bedlam. And you know, a lot of jobs, in the Keystone case we have potentially 32,000 jobs. Almost immediately. And then as you know I did the Dakota pipeline. And nobody called up to complain. Because it was unfair. Years of getting approvals. Nobody showed up to fight it. This company spends a tremendous, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars and then all of a sudden people show up to fight it. That's not fair to our companies. This is the pipeline that has brought about one of the largest gathering of Native peoples in the history of the United States. Tens of thousands of people, from hundreds of tribes have stood in solidarity for months against the building of this pipeline. I did not know how many of us have actually CALLED Donald Trump's White House, but no halfway informed leader could legitimately say they have not heard voices of opposition. Especially the President of the United States. But I thought, OK. I'll do it his way. So I looked up the Contact the White House web page and found the comments phone number. I composed a re-tweet of the video with a comment imploring people to call the White House Comment line at 202-456-1111. If Donald Trump wanted to hear from us via phone calls, so be it. I clicked Tweet and then immediately picked up my phone to call the White House, voice my complaint and protest President Trump's support and approval of the Dakota Access Pipeline. He concludes that the lack of phone calls is proof that Dakota Access Pipeline is not controversial, companies are being treated unfairly, and everyone is going to be happy in the end with his decision to approve the pipeline. I hung up the phone and deleted my tweet. Our elders leading the resistance at Standing Rock are very wise. When confronting companies driven by greed, they have modeled that the best resistance begins with prayer, ceremony and standing in solidarity. I would apply this same model to confronting a narcissistic President who is surrounded by billionaires and insulated by alternate facts. Donald Trump has intentionally chosen not to hear our protests, but Creator will definitely hear our prayers. Resist in beauty my relatives. Water is life. You cannot drink oil. So I tried calling and, after waiting on hold for nearly 8 minutes, was able to get through and voice my opposition. I have no idea how long the line is open for or how consistent it is. But apparently it is occasionally open. :-) The number to call is 202-456-1111. Resist in beauty my relatives. Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest 5 comments: Mark Charles said...

Hi Mark, after reading what you wrote here, I called the White House, too. I am so appalled at the lack of ability to communicate with this administration. Since the recording on that phone line suggested it, I went to the official White House Facebook page and sent a message. You commented officially that there were no phone calls of opposition to the Dakota pipeline. Since there is no way to make a phone call about the Dakota pipeline, I am officially voicing my extreme opposition to what you are doing with pipelines in our country in a Facebook message. Respectfully, there have been months of protests by people standing in the face of this project. This is the pipeline that has brought about one of the largest gathering of Native peoples in the history of the United States. Tens of thousands of people, from hundreds of tribes have stood in solidarity for months against the building of this pipeline. Please listen to your people. We have stolen the land of the Natives of this land, dedicated their culture and languages, took their children, and the list goes on. Yet we have never apologized. And now we want to endanger the drinking water of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, A federally recognized Indian tribe, a successor to the great Sioux nation. We have laws that require Federal agencies to consider environmental risks and to protection of Indian historic and sacred sites. But the Army corps of Engineers has chosen to ignore all those laws, and fast tracked this massive project just to meet the pipelines aggressive construction schedule. I join millions in my opposition to the construction of the Dakota pipeline. I am voicing my opposition here. February 8, 2017 at 8:26 PM Shelli Fynewever said... I meant to also say to you: thank you for your unfailing beautuiful resistance, dear Mark. You challenge me and so many to follow God's call for justice and Shalom with such grace.

You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. The standoff to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a fever pitch, and this may be our last chance to halt construction before Donald Trump takes office. Militarized law enforcement and private security firms are harassing, assaulting and jailing hundreds of non-violent protesters who are fighting for indigenous rights and to curb climate change. They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline.

Even for a church steeped in justice and reconciliation work, Episcopalians learned some lessons and were reminded of their calling to social justice work that is broad, deep and coordinated. The lessons can put the Church in good stead the next time it gets involved in advocacy on any scale. Some lessons were theological; others were logistical. Some were both. Episcopalians learned about the lengths to which they are called to reconcile with all peoples. They learned about listening and discerning before acting. The Church learned that standing in solidarity can come with unexpected costs. Local Episcopalians and, at times, Episcopalians from elsewhere, ministered to the locals and newcomers who joined the protest. The gathering drew members of close to 300 tribes in an unprecedented show of unity that resurrected the indigenous rights movement in the United States. Upwards of 6,000 to 10,000 people, indigenous and non-indigenous, were gathered along the river. The Rev. Lauren R. Stanley, left, superintending presbyter of the Rosebud Episcopal Mission (West), and the Rev. John Floberg, priest-in-charge of the Standing Rock Episcopal Mission on the North Dakota side, shortly after the announcement by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Photo: Paul Lebens-Englund The pipeline crosses under Lake Oahe, part of the Missouri River that flows along the eastern edge of Standing Rock. The tribe has water, treaty fishing and hunting rights in the lake. The company that built the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, says it will be safe and better than transporting oil by truck or railcar. Oil began flowing through the entire 1,172-mile, 30-inch diameter pipeline on June 1. The tribe has not yet achieved its objective of getting permitting authorities to abide by its treaty rights and renegotiate a route to take the pipeline away from its drinking water. Whether we succeed or not is out of our hands. U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg said the Corps needs to reconsider those issues. Whether Dakota Access must cease pipeline operations in the meantime is a separate question, which he has yet to consider. They organized to help the tribe protect its sovereign rights and its drinking water. Floberg, who has ministered with and to reservation residents for more than 20 years, repeatedly asked all Episcopalians to stand with the tribe. He urged them to avoid the other agendas that swirled over the Missouri River. Presiding Bishop Michael Curry speaks Sept. 24 at Oceti Sakowin Camp. Early on pipeline and law enforcement officials developed a disinformation campaign to discredit the protesters. The Intercept website recently reported that the pipeline company hired TigerSwan, a security firm founded by retired military special forces members, to lead that effort. It was hard to find allies among the non-native population in the Dakotas. Floberg belongs to a fledgling ecumenical clergy group that seeks to address the persistent racism. More than 500 interfaith witnesses march north along Highway 1806 Nov. 3 to the Backwater Bridge where they formed a Niobrara Circle of Life. Advocacy through action, not just words Yet, that involvement impressed others. Then they gave a copy of the 15th century document that gave Christian explorers the right to claim the lands they discovered to elders in Oceti Sakowin Camp and asked them to burn it. As a native person and as an Episcopal deacon, Mauai said, the ashes of that document symbolized the beginning of something that has needed to happen. Yet, it was important for Episcopalians to not assume they knew exactly how to act out those vows on Standing Rock. They needed to listen to what the people there needed from the Church and, Hauff said, what they did not need. Carmen Goodhouse, a full-blood Hunkpapa Lakota and a third-generation Episcopalian, speaks with Presiding Bishop Michael Curry during a listening time Sept. 24 at Oceti Sakowin Camp. South Dakota Bishop John Tarrant is beside Curry. The Rev. John Floberg, behind Curry, arranged the session. Floberg is supervising priest of the Episcopal churches on the North Dakota side of Standing Rock Reservation. Former Executive Council member the Rev. Brandon Mauai, left of Floberg, also welcomed Curry to the camp. They were not universally opposed to fossil fuels or to oil pipelines. All the Sioux Nation wanted, Kim said, was to protect its drinking water the way people in Bismarck did. Some environmental activists used the pipeline to protest any use of fossil fuels, Hauff said. The Episcopal Church was just one of many groups that got involved with Standing Rock. Some clergy from other denominations traveled north to Bismarck later that day, determined to get arrested to show their commitment. Floberg consistently counseled against such demonstrations. Oceti Sakowin camp spreads out in late January along land near where the Missouri River meets the Cannonball River. North Dakota Highway 1806 run across the top of the photo. Photo: Oceti Sakowin via Facebook Ministry of presence in practical form Along with advocacy and solidarity, the Church had a nitty-gritty and practical ministry of presence. St. James Episcopal Church in Cannon Ball, one of the churches Floberg serves, offered an inside place to meet. Its kitchen and working Wi-Fi were bonuses. The Episcopal Church flag flew in Oceti Sakowin Camp. The area it marked was known as a welcoming place. To anticipate where they were needed, Floberg and others watched what was happening and listened to what was being said, including on social media. They soon realized the camp needed portable toilets and dumpsters. Episcopalians told the rest of the Church that they wanted to help the tribe pay for them. People donated money. Episcopalians could not anticipate other needs so clearly. The money covered things such as Christmas dinner at St. James, various kinds of support in the camps and housing costs. Anticipating future needs, Episcopalians bought a cargo trailer, a dump trailer and a skid-steer loader. When the authorities decided to close the camps, they turned to Episcopalians for help. He enlisted people with pickup trucks and vans. Then, there was all the material left behind. Moreover, people sent material goods that were not needed. The donations were an unintended consequence of constant media coverage. Before and after the closing, Floberg helped salvage and distribute of more than 7,000 pounds of rice, beans and macaroni, as well as much of the flour, to area food banks. The remaining flour is now in his garage, awaiting a home. That lesson was one the Church began to learn as Episcopalians responded to the aftermath of the 2014 killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Kim said. Mni Wiconi, Water is Life, has been the motto of the resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline whose route now passes a half mile north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. While the Episcopal Church continues to minister with and to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, Episcopalians elsewhere can use the example in their own communities. Hauff said there is an even larger lesson for the Church.

We are not the churchnof progressivism. But this piece sees no difference between progressive an Christianity.

Guess they scanned the article instead of reading it. Otherwise they would have seen the part about this being addressed. Priscilla Johnstone says: June 22, 2017 at 4:42 pm I too am proud of our Episcopal church for supporting our ministry at Standing Rock. We are called to fight for social justice in our Baptismal vows. The history of treatment of Native American tribes by us ( via our government but certainly with support of a majority of people) is a dark history; the church has taken a position of reconciliation and now support of tribal rights. As the article states, the church clarified its presence to be one of prayer, addressing needs & working for peaceful resolution. Jesus does not call us to remain comfortable and blind to those in need, he calls us to help, to be involved, to support justice. The Episcopal church led the way through its mission at Standing Rock, joined by other faith communities. This was a very moving experience for me, to see our church as an island of faith, prayerful focus on peace while supporting the rights of indigenous people; we also maintained open communication with law enforcement and offered prayers for them. We have been following this story for 12 months . The protesters were given plenty of advance warning by tribal chairman archimbault and various governmental officials prior to the Feb 20th announcement to leave the camp for good. It was not just materials like tents. But in your words you are proud to stand with those people. It doesnt work that way. If you own the movement you own the good and the bad. This article is a disingenuous attempt to absolve our church of consequences it should have reasonably forseen. I applaud and appreciate them. Some people respond by paying trash bills and some people respond by laying their lives on the front line unarmed. Savannah Dee says: June 22, 2017 at 4:30 pm A considerably too long article, it does hit some very good points about social justice. How to help, what is actually helpful, how the Episcopalian church did with Standing Rock, and how they might better address these situations in the future. As Christ followers, we should all aim to serve. But serve in a way that is necessary and needed and asked for. Robert Nagy says: June 22, 2017 at 4:35 pm Fools (for Christ) rush in where angels fear to tread. I give thx for the ministry of my Church at Standing Rock. Blessings to all. I am proud of you for trying so hard and for being brave enough and open enough to learn lessons. The Spirit of God is with us. This is a great project that has prevailed despite the disingenuous, factually erroneous, opposition that was, unfortunately, aided by our church leadership.

Typical diatribe from a typical left-winger. The Savior you claim to follow would not approve of your self-rightous judgemental attitude. Very proud that we, as Episcopalians, were represented so well among those who stood with the Standing Rock Sioux nation against those profiteering from the exploitation and development of oil.

The moderator announced that only the first two of us would be able to ask our questions, that they did not have time for the third person. Of course, this meant that a young Black man would not get to ask his question. It was obvious he was very disappointed.

By doing this, and not demanding we be heard, we decentered Whiteness from that conversation. It was the right thing to do. The young man spoke of his mistreatment at the hands of the Denver police force, both as a young teen and as a young man. What he had to say went beyond what the other man and I had to say. After the forum, I talked with the other man who had elected to not ask his question so the young Black man could be heard. He was also an organizer who has done work against racism in his community in North Denver. If I am talking to other White people, I should talk about dismantling White supremacy and the need to decenter whiteness. I can talk about the centuries of structural oppression that has resulted in such high numbers of incarcerated and dead Black and Brown people in the United States. If I am in a group where people of color are discussing race, I have already been given a gift. I have been given an opportunity to learn. Generally, when this happens, it is because I am with people of color who know I will not insert myself into their discussion. As a White person in a Black or Brown space, I need to be aware that I am here to learn, and generally have little to teach. This is especially important in online discussions because asking for an explanation while someone is already giving information can derail the conversation. If the conversation was deep and the person you want to ask seems troubled or needs space, respect that. Their need for space is more important than your need for a quote at that moment. A lot of my work with Coloradans for Justice is clerical and supportive. I get permit paperwork done. I make Facebook events. I write emails. I write press releases. I canvass. I bring snacks and I make sure the amp is charged and the bullhorns have batteries. I make protest signs with generic sayings for people who want to hold a sign. I bring supplies for people who want to make a sign. I take pictures and video, and then upload it. I tweet. All of these things are things that need to be done in order for protest events to be peaceful and effective. All of these roles are activist actions. All of this is a huge reward, even if it is not a public reward. It is all the reward I need. In order for the movement to be maintained, there need to be more White people willing to take a backseat. To do the clerical and supportive work. To bring the activist cookies. There are a ton of things White people can do to further this movement, including talking to other White people. Black and Brown people do not need to hear about how oppressed they are and how much White supremacy sucks from White people. I promise you, they already know. Registered Nurse.

The demonstrators were attempting to break through a barricade put up by the state of North Dakota at the end of October, on a bridge on Highway 1806. Police used tear gas, concussion grenades, and rubber bullets, as well as a water cannon on the demonstrators. Indigenous Rising Media reported that 167 people were injured, including three elders. They wrote in an evening update that the police were targeting the heads and legs of the protesters. They are being trapped and attacked. One officer was reportedly hit in the head with a rock. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe is protesting the oil pipeline, pointing out that it is destructive to both sacred lands and to the environment. They have been actively protesting at the encampments since April, and have been joined by thousands of people from across the nation. The 1,160-mile pipeline will transport some 450,000 barrels of oil per day across the Missouri River and other sensitive habitats. Opponents observe that a leak would be catastrophic for the water supply of millions of people. In addition to the protest, the tribe is also suing the US federal government to stop construction.

Shut the pipeline down. Now. Forever. You are infinitely wealthier than most ordinary human beings on the planet, so you have no worries about where your next meal is coming from. You can afford to be generous and shut the Dakota Access Pipeline down once and for all. Your children's and grandchildren's future are at stake. Whether or not you believe in climate change or that fossil fuels are a finite resource, leaking oil from your pipelines can and does pollute our water supplies. Just ask the folks along the Kalamazoo River in Michigan and recently in Alabama and Pennsylvania, among many others in this country and around the globe. Yes, I know you personally will never worry about having enough clean water to drink or food to eat, but the vast majority of human beings do worry about these basic needs. The Standing Rock Sioux have suffered long enough due to our government's racist and genocidal policies. It makes me cry knowing that a 21 year old young woman, Sophia Wilansky, could lose her arm because of your lust for more profit. You have forever transformed the public's perception of our police officers from being defenders of the weak to one of acting as paid bullies for the oil barons. Covering for your cupidity, your bought-and-paid-for politicians, especially in the statehouse of North Dakota as well as the presidency, have destroyed our sense of fairness and justice. Try to look at it from the ordinary human being's point of view for a change. Try to think what God (or your Higher Power) would want you to do--to show mercy, to practice compassion, to act justly and to care for those who have little and will have even less because of your greed. Shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline today. The human race might not have a tomorrow if you don't. Donald Trump's election led to an immediate outcry from all across the nation and a sense of deep mistrust and even stunned disbelief from the governments of other countries. These protests are still ongoing. Hubris was a character flaw often seen in the heroes of classical Greek tragedy, including Oedipus and Achilles. From Merriam-Webster's Dictionary: Definition of HUBRIS: a great or foolish amount of pride or confidence Early last year a mid-ranking official in the Democratic Party of New York recounted how he and other officials were gathered together for a special announcement. People were in place, the mainstream media bought off in her favor, the game-plan written for the election. The stream of data from Wikileaks recounts the whole sorry story. When Independent US Senator Bernie Sanders announced he intended to run as a Democrat, he was treated as no threat. The fix was in for Clinton, courtesy of her wholly-owned party. They were there merely to make it look like the primaries were contested. The number of televised debates was kept at a ridiculously low level compared to previous elections thanks to the sterling efforts of Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Chair of the DNC, another example of the Clinton machine running interference for their principal. Then it became obvious Senator Sanders had tapped the anger felt by ordinary people against The Establishment. He called it as he saw it, and people listened in their millions. Suddenly her war chest looked inadequate for the purpose, so she sought further donations from her Wall Street sponsors. Social media broke out into open warfare between the supporters of Senator Sanders and Clinton. Friendships and relationships were broken by the millions. The primaries see-sawed back and forth. In those states where Diebold machines were used, the results looked seriously skewed. For instance, one county in West Virginia showed Senator Sanders winning 6,000 votes. An hour later his tally had been cut to 3,000. The majority of states that still relied upon conventional balloting methods went to Sanders. All of a sudden it looked like Clinton would not gain the nomination. But of course, the fix was in. Although I was in Philadelphia, I will gloss over the convention debacle. And so the election rumbled on with a rising crescendo of acrimonious debate raging across social media. The nominees themselves went through the motions on the three televised debates, spitting criticisms at each other and generally behaving like bad actors. They resisted the temptation to address any serious issues. It failed. They expected us all to fall into line behind her. What I found particularly nasty was the time soon after the convention when Clinton dragged Sanders to speak in New Hampshire, a place where he did particularly well and she badly. Poll after poll taken prior to the Democratic Convention showed Senator Sanders beating Trump by double digits, enough to translate to an election landslide of epic proportions. Clinton on the other hand fared poorly against Trump, her figures being within the margin of error on more than one occasion and often below. Yet to her followers she was the Anointed One, there to lead them to glory. Come election night, things did not look at all rosy for Clinton. As the evening wore on in her campaign HQ, the televisions showing election coverage were turned off. A fearful silence fell. Trump was winning. The celebratory firework show in NYC was canceled. The champagne remained unopened. At 2:30 A.M. Wednesday morning Clinton phoned Trump to concede the election. For the first time since 1928 Republicans will hold the House, Senate, the Presidency, the Supreme Court, and most state legislatures and governorships. All this because Clinton, in her pride, rejected the one person who could have beaten Trump in a landslide. She failed to engage with ordinary American voters or to discover and speak for what they really wanted. For the sake of her pride and burning ambition to become president, she forfeited the chance to enact genuine social change in the United States. Hubris has claimed her. BIO: Adrian J. Matthews is an author, artist, armchair historian and concerned citizen of the world. The legal basis for this petition is outlined in the Washington Post op-ed Obama can appoint Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if the Senate does nothing. Right-wing obstructionists are desperately trying to dissuade Americans from signing this petition by questioning the legal grounds of the waiver of rights argument, but their bias on this issue is indisputable. Even though the We the People Appoint Garland Now (Senate Has Waived Its Rights) petition has the minimum 100,000 signatures to get an official update from the White House within 60 days, please sign the petition anyway, to communicate to the White House the urgency of this matter to the American People. A 2016 SCOTUS recess appointment by President Obama should be effective through the end of the 115th Congress ending January 3, 2019 and will, in all likelihood, result in a case brought before our current eight member Supreme Court. The waiver of rights and other legal arguments including prior Supreme Court rulings on the substance over form doctrine can be put forth when and if this case is heard.

Snowflake Obsidian helps to keep centered and focused when any type of chaotic situation (office, commute, home, etc.) presents itself. Snowflake Obsidian can remove negativity from a space or person with ease. Volcanic in origin, Snowflake Obsidian helps to draw emotions to the surface and to examine harmful thought patterns. Physically, Snowflake Obsidian is associated with the skeletal and vascular systems, and is said to support smooth skin. The crystals for today are again reminding us to find and maintain balance. This has been a theme for the past few days. The place where we can let go of our own anger and resentments. Spend some time in meditation. Go get a reiki or energy healing treatment. I see skin issues and immune systems coming up within these crystals. Anyone who is struggling with breakouts or being sick often needs to pay attention to the level of stress in your life. You need to do proactive things to reduce stress in your life. If you can help yourself to be more balanced, your skin will clear up, and your immune system will function better. You will no doubt encounter negativity from others or even yourself today, and you need to let that go and keep centred. These crystals are here to send you calming and balancing energy. They are also here to send you love and prosperity. Mountain is the card that came up for today. How beautiful. We overcome so many mountains in life, every single day we are overcoming our own fears, challenges and emotions. Mountains are symbolic of strength. Mountains are also a place where people go for solace and rejuvenation. There is a place within you that is immovable. This is where your strength lies, and where you can always go when you need to overcome obstacles and emotions. This is a beautiful card of going within and finding the mountain of strength and resilience that lies within you. A message of finding the beautiful place within you where you can escape it all, where you can be happy and whole. This card is just reminding you of that inner strength, and your ability to be able to go within to find the place where you can not be disturbed. Finding the place within in you that is solid. A place where you can trust in life and find healing. A place where you feel strong and nothing can change that. Go within today, as many times as you may need, and find that inner strength. Keeping positive is guaranteed to bring good karma and abundance back to you. Yet, it can also pose challenges. It makes no sense to deny the strength you have at the cost of allowing yourself to be reactive and subject to external influences far beyond what is healthy for you. Imagine yourself as a mountain of strength, solidly grounded in the earth, your head held high as if you were touching the sky. Do so without straining, just as the mountain itself does not strain. The current situation calls for you to be vigilant, but not to the point of fear or paranoia. Be that rock of strength that you are capable of becoming. The solidness of your resolve will be clearly communicated when you model yourself after the towering immensity of a mountain, impenetrable and inscrutable. Standing steady like a rock is what is called for at this time. I pray for the President to step in and do the right thing, and put a stop to the pipelines once and for all. It is time, and we can no longer risk the health of our planet. We need to move toward a future where we are not dependant on oil and chemicals. We need a future free from the clutches and control of corporations. Stand steady and strong Standing Rock. My prayers are with all of you, and our dear Mother Earth.

TOM STROMME, TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Two pipeline protesters were convicted Tuesday of misdemeanors in the first Dakota Access-related jury trial in Morton County. On Monday, a 10-person trial was postponed after a judge learned some evidence had not been provided to the defense attorneys. Though the trial happened Tuesday, it was not without confusion and objections: Voliva first reached his defense attorney, William Thomason, shortly before trial and showed up seemingly unexpected in the courtroom midway through a 9 a.m. pretrial hearing. Kent Morrow, representing Shapiro, speculated that he was missing a key police report. Voliva is a part-Yupik retiree and artist who said he protested a pipeline in Alaska when he was younger. Shapiro is a teacher and farmer. Both said they worried about potential environmental consequences of the pipeline. Two other men arrested in the same incident were supposed to go to trial Tuesday, as well; but one did not have an attorney and was not in court. The other is in California and reached his attorney, Bob Quick, this past weekend, according to Quick. No representative of the Morton County State's Attorney's Office appeared at the pretrial hearing to respond to the objections, and South Central District Judge Bruce Romanick was determined to proceed. Jury selection Prosecutors and defense attorneys have expressed concern in recent days over their ability to find a fair six-person jury in Morton County. Their worries were reflected in questions asked by the judge and attorneys during the selection process. One man, who said he was in stopped traffic due to this protest, was quickly excused. Other potential jurors who did not make the final panel included a Mandan city commissioner, a man with family in law enforcement and the pipeline industry, and a man who said he records protests around Bismarck-Mandan for Facebook. Among the jurors serving were a homemaker, a pharmacist, a construction worker and an antiques dealer, who all said they could be fair. Trial The evidence presented at trial consisted of testimony of three law enforcement officers who were on N.D. Highway 6 that day. Mercer County Sheriff Dean Danzeisen, who was assisting Morton County, said he looked through binoculars and saw the car containing the defendants, who were masked, pull into the intersection of Highway 6 and County Road 135 south of St. Anthony so that a convoy of protesters could proceed without stopping. He said the men got out of the car. At least one car was stuck directly behind the protesters and another went around them, he said. Not mentioned in court was that a protest was staged that day along Highway 6 at a pipeline construction site. The defense attorneys countered that the state's case jumped to too many conclusions. And they just made some assumptions. Romanick gave them 10-day suspended sentences, meaning they will serve no jail time if they successfully complete a year on unsupervised probation. The prosecutor told the judge in court he intended to seek a hearing for reimbursement after the trial, because he contends the protesters are seeking to do economic harm to Morton County through their arrests.

Hundreds of tribes came together in a display of tribal unity not seen in hundreds of years. Thousands of people, both those within Native American communities and their non-Native allies, felt called to go to Standing Rock. As a Native American scholar of environmental history and religion, I believe that for most individuals who gathered at the site, it was a modern-day pilgrimage. Their answer was twofold. Individuals on a pilgrimage usually have these experiences both while traveling to certain places of transcendence and while at those sacred places. Lakota scholar Philip Deloria, has also described how the transformative experience of Native American sacred places provides meaning and personal growth for individuals who journey to be in their presence. RELATED: Why understanding Native American religion is key to resolving Dakota Access Pipeline crisis My cousin Renee LaPier and her daughter Modesta LaPier, for example, journeyed 2,600 miles to and from Standing Rock. And once at the site, they encountered a transformative experience. Modern-day pilgrimage It is not just Native Americans who have gone to Standing Rock. On Dec. 5 an estimated 2,000 U.S. veterans, both Native American and their non-Native allies, made their pilgrimage to Standing Rock in a freezing blizzard. They came from across the U.S. and other parts of the world; they represented American veterans from many conflicts and wars, including older Korean and Vietnam vets and younger Iraqi vets. She explains how they are blending their individual religious ideas and political activism into a new form of religious expression. Many Native Americans and non-Native allies viewed going to Standing Rock as a pilgrimage. I have read hundreds of social media posts of people who were drawn to go there as a spiritual quest, reflecting on how the experience changed their sense of identity, gave meaning to their lives, provided a sense of community and transformed them forever. It is true that some come for personal goals of spiritual awakening and some to journey to a sacred place. And, there are others who undertake a spiritual journey to find community, and purpose.

Only one problem remained: I had to find a way to go. I am not a man of means. I weighed obligations, such as bills and work, and considered travelling expenses. I glanced at my vehicle, already knowing it was hardly suited for the 1,100-mile drive from my home in north-east Oregon, and resigned myself to staying home. In early November, I was contacted by my good friend Jamie Stone, who said he wanted to go and offered his truck and trailer to haul supplies. Jamie also happens to be a former oil worker on the North Slope of Alaska. His uncle is an oil executive, and his brother works for oil companies around the globe, but he also has family members who are farmers in the midwest and have had easements forced across their own land for oil pipelines. I quickly agreed to the opportunity, but requested that we attempt to raise donations for the water protectors, the group of Native Americans representing over 300 different tribes who are encamped near the location where the pipeline is slated to cross the Missouri river. They had put out a call for donations of firewood and winter camping supplies. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jack Walker, a tree care specialist from Oregon, cuts firewood to be donated to the water protectors. Where I live, in the wooded mountains of north-east Oregon, firewood is abundant. So the first thing I did was start reaching out to people for firewood donations. The response was overwhelming. Within 24 hours, we had reached our goal and acquired two more full-sized pickups and another trailer to accompany us. People also gave winter clothes, bulk food, horse feed and tack for the Sioux youth riders who have been active on the front lines of the movement since day one. Jack Walker, from Wallowa County, Oregon, was one of the people who donated. In the picture above, he is seen cutting firewood to take to Standing Rock. Chief Joseph, a leader in the Nez Perce war of 1877. Photograph: Public domain Wallowa County itself, much like the Standing Rock area, is home to one of the most tragic tales in American history and the Indian wars. Much as cities in the Dakotas are named for local tribes, Wallowa County and my hometown of Joseph are named for the people who had to endure atrocities committed by settlers eager to clear that land. The story of Chief Joseph, in particular, is yet another tale of a protector willing to sacrifice everything in the face of insurmountable odds. Chief Joseph was a leader in the Nez Perce war of 1877, in which his tribe and others opposed the US army. They were cut short not far from the border by a surprise flank attack in which much of the tribe was killed. All my friends are there. My father is buried there. Some of my children are buried there. I like the white people, but they have driven me out of my home. I have friendly feelings for all. My blood is the same that flows in the veins of the white men. We will all die just the same. Joseph was not allowed that right, and he died in exile. Cody is a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian reservation, which is not far from my home.

Photograph: Joe Whittle for the Guardian On the long drive into the Great Plains from the mountains and forests of our home, we talked of the days when his tribe and the Nez Perce would cross the continental divide and hunt bison, sometimes allying with the Sioux who lived on the plains, occasionally warring with them. Travelling those aisles of American history together felt surreal, considering where we were headed. History, it seemed, was repeating itself, only in a more modern form. When we finally arrived, it was dark and cold, and we were met by a security team. After the team made sure we were not intoxicated or bringing weapons, we were allowed in. Around 4,000 people are spread across roughly one-mile stretches of land on either side of the Cannonball river, which are filled with tipis, tents and a few RVs. My own daughter was fired at with rubber bullets while kneeling on the ground praying The sounds of Native American drum groups and songs echoed through the crisp air. Native people have survived 500 years of atrocity on this continent with the help of prayers, ceremony, and our community. We are steady in our promise to never give up on our cultural and spiritual relationship with the land and water we owe everything to. It is perhaps for this reason that despite the continuing war against our way of life, there is love, happiness and a deep spirituality at Oceti Sakowin Camp. In the distance, to my left, I could see the bright lights coming from a line of police cars behind the barricade, across State Highway 1806. To my right, high-powered floodlights near the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) construction site shone brightly, pointing at the camp all night long.

My own daughter, Mia, a 4.0-grade average student at Stanford University with a full-ride doctorate scholarship to any university in the world, was fired at with rubber bullets while kneeling on the ground praying. The following is the text message I received from her after a terrified night of watching live feeds on Facebook from my home back in Oregon: My friend was shot with a rubber bullet right next to me. Her auntie took care of us; she swiftly and strongly guided us back to the van where she was taken to the medics. She was a badass warrior. The women are all holding it down, that needs to be clear. They are the ones who get forgotten about in these movements, their importance needs to be emphasized. The entire area is considered a sacred area, and said to contain other graves. When construction began, water protectors made an attempt to occupy the location to protect it. Police responded with violent force and lined the shores of the Cannonball river under the hill, repelling people with rubber bullets and high powered pepper spray. Many people were injured. It was one of the most violent encounters of the ongoing resistance. Last week, Sophia Wilansky, 21, was seriously injured after being hit by a projectile when officers threw less-than-lethal weapons at demonstrators. She might lose her arm. They marched to the police roadblock, and performed a 21-gun salute for a fallen veteran and a prayer ceremony on the bridge. Many people are surprised to learn of the seeming irony of the fact that Native Americans possess more enrolled military members per capita than any other ethnicity in America. Law enforcement officers have, too. Former Wallowa County police officer Michelle Bloker joined the caravan from Oregon. Jeff Ginter, a former Department of Justice investigations officer and Homeland Security air marshall, was at Standing Rock during my time there. Retired after 30 years in law enforcement, Jeff has an easy way about him which would lend itself to de-escalation tactics as a police officer. It was needed. The abuses are many. My own brother Larry Whittle, a Marine Corps veteran of the Gulf war and enrolled member of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, also decided to show solidarity at Standing Rock. On my fifth day there, he informed me that he would be joining the peaceful direct action. Their intent was to march peacefully down a county road to DAPL headquarters, where tribal elders would pray and hold ceremony to bless the sacred sites being disturbed by pipeline construction. The group was threatened by an angry local owner of a construction company called Four Square Concrete, who flew into a rage at having his drive home impeded by water protectors. After pushing into several protectors with his truck while laying on his horn and revving his engine, he pulled out a handgun and began pointing it at people. Before leaving the scene, he reached his gun out the window and fired seven rounds over the crowd. We used to go out there and listen to the spirits, really listen to what they had to say. Photograph: Joe Whittle for the Guardian He and his friends are the peaceful modern-day equivalent of the famous Great Plains horse warriors of yesteryear. It was their ancestors who defeated Gen Custer at the famous battle of the Little Bighorn. They have not only been instrumental in helping to initiate the movement, but also in leading and inspiring it. They have provided security for people in the camp and repeatedly protected elders during confrontations. One horse was shot twice with lethal ammunition by an unknown assailant during one protest encounter. Another horse was killed by rubber bullet impact from police during the first Backwater Bridge incident. Lakota leader Crazy Horse spoke of his vision of that prophecy with the following words: Upon suffering beyond suffering, the Red Nation shall rise again and it shall be a blessing for a sick world. A world filled with broken promises, selfishness and separations. A world longing for light again. I see a time of seven generations when all the colors of mankind will gather under the sacred Tree of Life and the whole Earth will become one circle again. In that day there will be those among the Lakota who will carry knowledge and understanding of unity among all living things, and the young white ones will come to those of my people and ask for this wisdom. So far, Standing Rock has seen visitors come from as far as Tibet, Japan, and New Zealand to offer support. Even the last remaining indigenous people of Europe, the Sami tribe, have sent representatives. People such as Lakota youth Phillip Wright believe the time Crazy Horse described is now. The Yellow Nation, the Red Nation, the Black Nation, and the White Nation, all came together. There is a sense of history in the making. This is what they were probably talking about. They were calling us, warning us about something. No one at the camp really wants to think about the possibility of the pipeline crossing the river. But there is definitely a sense that something bigger is happening. Please choose your username under which you would like all your comments to show up. You can only set your username once.

This is intended to widen the perspective beyond that of an arriving journalist and to give everyone a chance to show their relationship to the land and camp. Some of the people have been watching this protest unfold for months; others arrived more recently. My last meeting was with a Lakota man named Travis who lived in Pierre. At the end of our conversation, he told me that he was heading to a pipeline protest that weekend and I should come along. As far as the Lakota were concerned, this was their land, the site of their burial grounds and sacred spaces, and their main source of water. They saw the pipeline as a direct threat to their environment. Right: a teepee in the nearby Standing Rock camp. Over the next few months, thousands of people amassed in the Standing Rock camp along the banks of the Cannonball River, with tribal representatives arriving not just from across North America, but from as far away as Norway, New Zealand, and the Amazon. Having spent several years photographing the ways that the US and Canadian governments have tried to subjugate, marginalize, and assimilate First Nations peoples, it was frustrating for me to have to leave after a week. I knew I had colleagues on the ground who were doing amazing work, Native and non-Native, and realistically I knew that my presence would have been completely redundant. I focused on other projects and commitments, but kept an eye on Standing Rock. To tell the story properly, I knew I had to do something different. So instead, I turned to the residents of the Standing Rock camp, to the water protectors and local North Dakotans who had been living through this conflict for months. These are their photos, and their words. He mills all of the pieces at home in New Mexico and drives them up in a moving truck. The structure is made from wood, covered with tarp, and insulated with blankets. I went back home and it was bugging me, so I figured out how to put a yurt together. I used to work in construction and I like to build things, so it was easy for me. I brought the first one up and got it set up in about two hours, and now I've made six here. They're warm and sturdy and can fit about six to eight people. He took this photo of officers on what has become known as the front line of the DAPL protests, before various barricades were erected on Backwater Bridge. The figure in the hoodie and gas mask stared down the officers in silence. There are peaceful people, there are prayerful people, there are violent people. And I'm just here to worry about the people with violent intentions. When we looked fire hoses, well, that was a bad optic. That made us look bad. Using water was a means to remove those agitators from that situation. We stopped at the sacred fire, and I busted out my hand drums, and I knew how I could contribute. She took the photo of bison roaming freely in Theodore Roosevelt National Park over the summer. Half of them are paid to be here. But they think they're entitled to go on the Army Corps of Engineers' land and just set up camp. They think they're entitled to go on neighboring farms and ranches and run amok. Their ancestors may have been here before my ancestors, but that doesn't mean anything now. Now we all are having to suffer.

I didn't think I could make it up here. But all of a sudden I started seeing all these signs: It was always raining, I saw this amazing double rainbow, all of these things pointing to water. Every sense was telling me I had to come. Right, a photo by her shows the yurt at Pueblo Camp, which was painted by Legun Coriz. We have this connection to our land. We've all experienced similar traumas. It's that solidarity with sovereignty. It's stepping up and saying that as Native people, we're still here. I was working on a degree in environmental science and sustainability at UNM. Right, a photo that he took shows the ceremonial relighting of a sacred fire. It's been eye-opening for me. It's been an awakening. I came to bring back stories to my community about what this means, what it means to be part of this. They know there's a pipeline, but they don't really know what's going on. At left, a photo by Stacey shows her and her grandson Benjamin in Carrington, North Dakota. One of the days they came in to protest in Mandan, I was trying to take my son to dialysis in Bismarck and it took us forever to get out because they were blocking off the roads. I didn't appreciate that. I don't want to see pipelines near sacred lands. It's our water. We need to think about the next generation. At right, he takes shelter from the weather in the Standing Rock Casino, which became a base for water protectors to take an occasional break from the harsh winter weather. But for me, it's turned into a spiritual awakening. We're all going to take this home. This is going to mean something to all the other pipeline fights. At right, one of his images shows a police clash with water protectors after a man brandishing a loaded AR-15 began to threaten the crowd. And people here need help. I've seen police abuse first hand and I know if there's no evidence, it didn't occur. Without photos, it's just our word against theirs. So I'm here, and I'm taking photos. At right, a photo that he took earlier this year shows a view of Oceti Sakowin camp shortly after the Wabashaws first arrived. We had to be here. This is more important than all of us.

Unarmed water protectors have been bitten by attack dogs, sprayed with pepper spray, beaten, shot with rubber bullets, and even hit with concussion grenades. Sophia Wilansky nearly lost her arm to a concussion grenade that was shot by police. She is still recovering. I also covered when reporter Erin Schrode was shot with a rubber bullet during her interview. Perhaps the most ironic thing that has been done to the people the governor now ostensibly wants to protect from cold weather is when the militarized police blasted them with freezing water in sub-freezing temperatures. All of this comes just days before THOUSANDS of veterans plan to arrive at Standing Rock and join the fight for a clean and safe future. The state of North Dakota and the Army Corps of Engineers has claimed they will not use force to evict the water protectors. Therefore I imagine this executive order is designed to allow police to stop anyone else from arriving at the camp. Many around the world are sending support for the water protectors and those helping them in this fight.

Since 1897. Letters Fertility Is Not The Enemy Of Feminism. The Way The Jewish Community Pushes It Is. Stein, 24, told the student she was Jewish and that her ancestors spoke Yiddish. And when she said no, he accused her of being a hypocrite. That was, in a nutshell, how Stein ended up this past summer learning Yiddish at Yiddish Farm, an organic farm in Goshen, New York, that works entirely in the mameloshn and runs intensive language immersion classes. And that was where Stein found herself when history happened on an encampment at a reservation about six hours north of Pine Ridge. Protests against a massive oil pipeline, partly organized by a group Stein had helped start, had grown by leaps and bounds to defend land local Native American groups view as both sacred and crucial to their welfare. Dusty Nelson A Different Approach: Stein started teaching at the Pine Ridge Girls School, which incorporates Lakota culture throughout the curriculum, in September. Share Facebook Twitter Pinterest Email Several months before she left for Yiddish Farm, Stein became an early participant in the current struggle to protect Native American land in the Dakotas. Energy Transfer Partners, a Texas-based oil and gas company, is trying to build an immense 1,172-mile pipeline from North Dakota to Illinois over the objections of Dakota people on the Standing Rock Reservation, whose land it will cross. Like the Pine Ridge Reservation to the south, where Stein works, the Standing Rock Reservation, which straddles the border between South and North Dakota, suffers from a shortage of potable water. In March, Stein, Locke and another friend, Margaret Potts, founded the organization People Over Pipelines to help rally opposition to the plan. The activists met with tribal councils and Dakota elders, and organized protests. People Over Pipelines, alongside other organizations such as ReZpect Our Water, circulated a petition that received more than 200,000 signatures. A group of runners carried the document over 550 miles to Omaha to deliver it in person to the nearest district office of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Stein accompanied the runners for 15 miles of their journey. In April, demonstrators founded an encampment known as Sacred Stone Camp on the Standing Rock Reservation in an effort to monitor the situation and prevent construction of the pipeline through direct action and communal prayer. Stein helped organize a group of young people who rode horses to the camp, stopping at sites that are holy or of historical importance to the Dakota people. By July, several hundred people from more than 90 tribes nationwide were participating daily. On weekends, their ranks swelled to thousands. Today, hundreds of tents and teepees, serving as homes to whole families, dot the protest site, at the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers and stretching across the plain. What has become the largest gathering of indigenous nations in modern American history has moved the U.S. Army, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior, which oversees Native American affairs, to issue two key decisions. One, by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, was to hold off on issuing permits to Energy Transfer Partners to dig on federal land near or under the Missouri River above the Standing Rock Reservation. Back home now, in Porcupine, South Dakota, on the Pine Ridge Reservation, Stein is again immersed in the struggle. But her summer at Yiddish Farm has affected her. I come from a very assimilated Reform family, and although I went to synagogue and had a bat mitzvah, I felt that my student was right. I was estranged from my roots. Stein spent a lot of her time at Yiddish Farm thinking about the similarities between Ashkenazi Jewish and Lakota culture. Though the two seem worlds apart, she saw certain similarities. The relationship of both groups to their ancestral language, for instance, has been strongly influenced by the collective trauma of genocide. Stein voiced frustration that there has been so little discussion about the pipeline protest in the Jewish world. One of the few groups to demonstrate in support of the effort, she noted, is Jewish Voice for Peace, which is essentially persona non grata in the organized Jewish community due to its stance on boycotts, divestment and sanctions relating to Palestine and Israel. In July, the group sent a delegation to the National Democratic Convention in Philadelphia to join a protest in solidarity with the demonstrators on Standing Rock. Indigenous issues and the plight of endangered languages were the main reasons Stein originally decided to move to Pine Ridge. Stein received a teaching fellowship through AmeriCorps to work at a Catholic high school on the reservation, which is known for its intensive Lakota language program. While teaching computer skills, she became a student herself, sitting in on Lakota classes at the Red Cloud Indian School. Life on Pine Ridge is very different from her life growing up in Connecticut and going to college in Boston. Environmental toxins left behind from uranium mining have led to increased cancer rates. Other diseases, including diabetes and alcoholism, shorten life expectancy by nearly 30 years compared to the national average. After generations of suppression by schools and government agencies, the Lakota language and culture is undergoing a renaissance. Education institutions such as the Red Cloud Indian School once punished children for speaking their mother tongue or using their Lakota names. Now, they encourage students to embrace their culture. With an initial enrollment of 16 girls in sixth and seventh grades, the school teaches all its classes through the lens of Lakota culture. In science, her students learn about the big bang and explore how the scientific theory aligns with the Lakota understanding of the origin of the universe.

In all of this time, sacred burial grounds and concern for alternative water intake sources were never raised by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Some facts: The pipeline is not near any sacred tribal lands. The pipeline is not on Native American property. The pipeline company tried many, many times to meet with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. For over seven years, the tribe never felt this project was important enough to participate in the planning. Standing Rock is now home to an estimated 4,000 protesters. The occupy-style protest continues to expand as the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline grows increasingly popular as a topic among mainstream news outlets. I know that there are many honest, patriotic people who have put their heart into the fight at Standing Rock. Their motivation in most cases was pure. This situation is no different than the many honest people who protested against the police involved shooting of Mike Brown in Ferguson, MO or the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore, MD. In each case (and there are many others like these) the Globalist controlled media used a false narrative to stir emotions, generate anger and cause riots. Mike Brown assaulted Darren Wilson, tried to take his service weapon (resulting in its discharge) and then tried to attack him again. The death of Freddie Gray was a tragic accident and the media knew it. These too are simply fabricated false narratives perpetuated by the media. Globalist greed requires control. The loss of the most recent election to a nationalist (Donald Trump) has caused the Globalists to redirect all of their efforts to his destruction; even if it requires the destruction of our economy to achieve the goal. It is also important to point out that like the Black Lives Matter movement; the Indigenous Rising movement seeks to drive deep wedges between the protesters and local law enforcement. The Globalists know that federalization of the police and diminishing the authority of local police and sheriffs is critical to their success. The protesters have blocked entrances to businesses and banks. They have also blocked critical roads and highways. The way this works is as follows: Find a cause; racial, environmental or social. While President Obama is in office, these initiatives have been supported by his administration (Black Lives Matter, the plight of the illegal aliens, Islamic terrorism, safe-cities, sanctuary cities, climate change, etc.). Because of the outcome of the most recent election, federal government supported divide and conquer cannot be the final step in the sequence. It has two main targets; banking and commerce. The protests in Portland Oregon have focused damage on the retail sector. It works. This approach is very efficient and has already caused banks invested in the project to lose customers and deposits. Standing Rock is the prototype. With Hillary Clinton as President, our out-of-control spending would have led to our need to seek financial assistance from the Globalist masters. Under Hillary Clinton, Our acceptance of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) agreement would have ensured that a European Union like control mechanism would be able to end our national sovereignty and subject our citizens to the will of unelected TPP union officials. Our borders would remain open, destroying our economy and requiring an ever increasing need for debt to feed, house, educate and provide medical care for an unlimited number of illegal immigrants and refugees. After reading this article, you may think the solution to this problem is simple; lock up George Soros. He is just the face of an evil entity intent on world domination. Lock him up and another will take his place; instantly. The solution to our problem is to end the Globalist controlled mainstream media hypnosis our people are being subjected to. I am talking about NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, MSNBC and to some extent FoxNews. In addition to getting your local community squared away to ride out an economic collapse and the resulting violence (see our Community Preparedness Team (CPT) initiative), we must also develop strategies to defeat the Globalists. We must communicate with and support other liberty-minded organizations. We must take back the college campuses by aggressively engaging the Marxist enemy there (something Oath Keepers will be doing with our new College Oath Keepers initiative that will establish Oath Keepers student groups on campuses nationwide this Spring Semester). In order to diminish the effectiveness of their false narratives, we must be vigilant in producing media and articles that expose the lies. Other ideas that have been suggested and should be discussed include: Boycott their National News programming. Protest at their news headquarters in New York City, Washington, DC and Atlanta. Publicly ridicule their false narratives using alternative media outlets. Purchase roadside billboards to discredit their journalism and expose their bias. In order to prevail, we need to be uncompromising and steadfast. While this is being hailed as a major victory for the protestors, I see it as no different that the actions of the Obama Administration raising the hopes of protestors in Ferguson, MO when Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the U.S. Justice Department would use every resource of the Federal Government to pursue civil rights charges against police officer Darren Wilson. No permanent action was taken today by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Certainly nothing that will withstand a court challenge. If the actions of the Obama Administration cause protestors to leave North Dakota during the most brutal winter months of northern plains weather, then maybe, just maybe some good can come of this. I doubt that will be the case. If anything, the Obama Administration has proven itself to be predictable when it comes to appeasement of environmental and social justice causes. After weeks of protests from Native Americans and environmental activists, the Army Corps of Engineers announced Sunday that it was refusing to let Energy Transfer Partners LP build a section of the project under Lake Oahe in North Dakota and would begin a lengthy environmental review. But that decision runs headlong into the pledge from Trump to greenlight new energy infrastructure. 0 Navy Jack During my service I deployed on various platforms, including submarines, amphibious assault units and special boats. I participated in expeditionary and humanitarian missions to the North Atlantic, Iran, Beirut, Libya, and the Caribbean. I am a Patron Life Member of the NRA. I am an Oath Keeper Life Member. Like I keep repeating, until there is a consequence for these evil doers, we the people will not see any improvement but rather a continuation of their goals. Josie says: December 6, 2016 at 12:06 am I second your post. I grieve for the Finicum family, and my heart is heavy knowing a good and fearless man was ambushed and murdered. Many people do not even realize they are being sold a lie again. Norton II says: December 4, 2016 at 11:47 am Too right Jack : My little glimmer of information about Standing Rock has come from a Tribal Elder, and her take away after visiting was not positive. All they are doing is pushing a can of worms on Trump. Blueotter says: December 4, 2016 at 1:15 pm I am a Native American Church leader and an Oathkeeper. I have been doing weekly interviews on Prophecykeepers Radio since August with some of the Grandmothers who have been involved, and one of them told me that she feared Soros was behind and had evil intentions to use them. Going back into history, our young people have long caused trouble for us, going against the wishes of their elders, because we believe no man should be forced to do what another tells them to do. Smitty says: December 4, 2016 at 2:45 pm The Standing Rock protest are simply a green party creation, remember Jill Stein vandalized equipment as a campaign stunt. These marxist will be very disruptive over the next few years and may turn violent like the anarchist. It is very possible they will be the genesis of a civil uprising where we will be forced into the streets to protect our communities. I think we crossed that bridge weeks ago. Navy Jack is a digrace to the service. I fought to keep keep opression from this country, not to allow it to happen. Water cannons and sting ball gernade use on protesters sounds like that to me. Their right to free speech is being being beaten out of them with military equipment. Since you have brought this up, I will say that a peaceful protest does not involve lighting fires on private property, killing rancher livestock, blocking key highways needed for emergency response vehicles, vandalizing of property and businesses in the nearby towns and cities, chaining people together inside banks and other financial institutions, assaulting police officers and sheriff deputies, hurling objects at first responders or trespassing. All of which the citizens of North Dakota have had to deal with from the Astroturf protesters that have been flocking to this event. All of which preceded any response from the Sheriff and the local authorities. Now with regard to the use of the water cannon, I do not think that it was appropriate considering the temperature at the time. Regardless of what you may have heard on the mainstream news, nobody was seriously injured as a result of its use. There were 17 cases of mild hypothermia. As for the other crowd control measures used, I think if you read my previous articles you will see I have always been opposed to the militarization of civilian police. With that said, based on the violence being perpetrated by the protesters, the Governor of North Dakota had every right to deploy the Dakota National Guard to stop the violence which the protestors alone were responsible for. The behavior of the anarchists and social justice warriors that have come to North Dakota is no different than that of the protestors that travelled to participate in the riots in Portland, Baltimore, Ferguson or any other city targeted by the Globalists and their mainstream news media accomplices. I suggest that before you jump on the bandwagon for a cause, you consider actually talking to the people whose lives have been affected by the violent actions of the protesters. kmcgaugh says: December 13, 2016 at 1:09 pm I agree with every part of this article except you left out the science of steel underground pipes. They all corrode and will leak. They must all be dug up and replaced at some point in the future. The oil is toxic so even a small leak will cause a some environmental damage. Oil floats on water so an oil leak under a body of water will rise to the surface of the water. Commercial engineering is not to be trusted without some codes of conduct that consider the long term economic risk to others. Oil tankers are required to have a double hull. Gas stations must place their underground fuel tanks inside a double vault with sensors to measure liquid intrusion and surface dip tubes to sample any liquid in the vault. The evil motives of George Soros are not the only motives to be considered. He is just trying to capitalize on the situation. If this was my land I would oppose the underground pipe and support an over ground pipe. Nice try. Mac says: December 16, 2016 at 4:24 pm BlackWolf1, you are so wrong about this issue. The pipeline uses NEW technology that Environmentalists themselves demand be used to replace existing at-risk pipelines. President Obama ends his term with one sad DISGRACE after another. First we find out that for his 8 years CHINA deemed what countries (not Taiwan) could call the President. Second, today we find the Army Corps completely caves in, the pipeline will have to traverse a much more built-up area on the other side of Bismarck, N.D. with much more intrusive construction. I should have addressed it in the article. Thank you. are all OWNED by the very globalists who are causing the problem. What they are doing is wilful and with complete knowledge and intent. I think the world is pretty fucked. Our country has become so partisan and the lack of constructive, nuanced discussion between sides is so toxic. I seriously doubt humanity will exist in 200 years Sun City Media says: December 5, 2016 at 8:55 pm Well written article by Navy Jack. It has been happening throughout history and some are obviously very clever at doing it. Yes, articles such as this need to be read so people get exposure to the bigger picture. They can then do the due diligence and make more informed decisions about where to put their allegiances. Hopefully a Trump presidency will see the emergence of a more honest and accountable and Constitutional 4th Estate. You can read what I consider to be some of the responsibilities of good media business on the Blog page of the Sun City Media website. Yoda says: December 6, 2016 at 5:17 pm I understand that there are a lot of vets at Standing Rock in support of the protest. It is not a good feeling to think you are giving honorable service only to find out later that you were working for the enemy. Passing this article might just save some from that. It is also information warfare action. Many times the pen really is greater than the sword. Great info, Jack. Hopefully, local law enforcement can provide the necessary wood shampoos to these hippies. I wish I had more time to study any trends in messaging. You make it quite clear to which side you are on when you go to length in mention of cattle , machinery, or property being vandalized, yet not one Elder has condoned such actions, nor has every one of those actions been proven true, as done by the protesters . MTguy says: December 20, 2016 at 10:55 am If the tribe would have taken part of the regulatory meetings (not the non regulatory meeting with the company and not the Army Corps of Engineers that you reference which is actually an audio recording put out on youtube in video format) they would have been able to go and identify what is sacred to them. If any person reads the opinion from his ruling and still thinks the tribe was in the right here, I truly feel sorry for their lack of intelligence. You mention that not one elder has condoned these acts, but that is not true as Chase Iron Eyes (former Senate Candidate) has called for these acts. There have only been a few Elders who have condemned these acts as well. I have been living through this for over 100 days now and have had the benefit of seeing the local news coverage and going to the camp. You make it clear which side you are on, which is that of the rail road who stands to lose significant amounts of money if this pipeline is completed. Jason says: February 2, 2017 at 1:47 pm As long as you continue to believe that everyone who protests is a globalist Marxist instead of someone who simply does not believe the multinational corporations should have all the power you will be a puppet for the people who really want to control all aspects of American life. To suggest for a second that this pipeline is not a project developed by globalists is absurd. The people who run these corporations are the ones who wrote TTP, which was support by both the Obama and the entire Republican Party as well as the Democratic Party. As long as you see everyone who stands up for their rights as a Marxist, except yourself, you will never achieve anything. Under US CODE 18: Paid Protesters are TERRORISTS. The PENALTY under Code 18 is 20 years to life in PRISON, or death. Blacks against Whites in the USA, Muslims against Christians in Europe, these civil wars will have the immense advantage to destroy the people without confrontations between degenerate countries into nuclear power world war.

Single Page Print Page Only as a story will this make sense. The place was unusually empty for the summer, which is when Livingston fills with visitors from all over the world. I ordered pancakes and gazed out through the big picture window onto Main Street. There were almost no cars, and not a single pedestrian. The town was sleepy. Dead. The Yellowstone River, a world-class trout stream that is also the longest undammed river in the lower forty-eight and the key to the tourist economy of Livingston, had been closed by order of the state. No fishing. No boating or rafting. A quarantine. The cause was a fish kill. Whitefish had begun to wash up on the banks and there was a fear that the trout might also start dying. The immediate culprit was a parasite, a tiny jellyfish, but the larger culprit, it seemed, was climate change. Thanks to a hot, dry summer and a mild winter that had failed to replenish the snowpack in the Absaroka Mountains, the Yellowstone was running low and warm, stressing the fish and rendering them vulnerable to microscopic enemies. Ten days later, in early September, the river had partially reopened, but the town was still deserted as I sat in my office reading Black Elk, by Joe Jackson, a comprehensive new biography of the fabled Sioux medicine man. When I told friends about the visitations they listened patiently enough, but only one, Sherman Alexie, the brilliant Native American fiction writer, noted their complex and often contradictory significance. His fate was to survive a rolling catastrophe with eyes wide open, his luck also his curse. A passage describing the murder of Sitting Bull, the beloved Hunkpapa Sioux chief, on the Standing Rock reservation in the Dakotas just weeks before the massacre finally forced me to set the book aside and turn on my phone for diversion. There it was again, that haunting place-name, linked on my Twitter feed to a photo of a dog snapping and leaping at a Native woman. I tapped on the associated article. Five hundred miles from me, in North Dakota, several thousand people, many of them Indians from different tribes, had gathered to protest an unfinished oil pipeline set to run under the Missouri River. They feared that an oil spill might harm the great body of water, which, as it happens, begins in Montana, just west of where I live, and eventually merges with the Yellowstone before flowing south through the Dakotas. Now they were under siege. Again. The attack dogs belonged to a private security firm hired by the pipeline company, and local police had blocked a nearby highway. There are times as a reader when to keep on reading feels like an evasion. I stared at the book beside me on the couch, feeling angry, challenged, and inconvenienced. To merely review the biography seemed suddenly shameful; the traumas it conjured were still alive, and in the very same locales. My sense of critical distance had collapsed. Flames were rising from the waters and in the flames a blue man lived. The dust was floating all about him in the air, the grass was short and withered, the trees were wilting, two-legged and four-legged beings lay there thin and panting. As for the images of decay and drought, I could find them a few blocks away along the Yellowstone, whose shriveled channels still smelled of rotting fish. I packed a duffel bag. Around midnight, two hundred miles down the road, a raven sailed through my high beams, deftly banking as it cleared my hood.

You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. The standoff to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a fever pitch, and this may be our last chance to halt construction before Donald Trump takes office. Militarized law enforcement and private security firms are harassing, assaulting and jailing hundreds of non-violent protesters who are fighting for indigenous rights and to curb climate change. They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline.

Approximately 36 people were arrested after refusing to leave the campgrounds after the Wednesday deadline set by Republican Gov. Doug Burgum and the Army Corps of Engineers had passed. But this is about much more than three hours; it is about much more than even the past year.

The soldiers were going by canoe along the Bobonaza River, were not on duty and had not asked permission to enter the territory, according to the Kichwa. Pictures of the soldiers sitting on benches inside a camp were also posted. The detainment comes as tensions flare once again over government-enabled corporate exploitation of native lands. A Chinese mining site was attacked by another indigenous group, the Shuar, who say the mine encroaches on their territory. In August, indigenous protesters briefly detained 27 soldiers and demanded the release of dozens of demonstrators who had been arrested. The protesters have every reason to be concerned. The Kichwa de Sarayuka endured a 17-year struggle to defend their land from attempts by corporations and the Ecuadorian government to drill for oil. The Kichwa fended off several illegal moves and bribery attempts by an Argentinean oil company, as well as attacks on camps by government forces using tear gas. The Inter American Commission on Human Rights (CIDH) found that Ecuador had violated its duty to consult with the Kichwa before signing contracts for mineral extraction. Instead, the government raided a Kichwa community and arrested five members they claimed were terrorists. This, despite that fact that the entire resistance had always been peaceful. In 2009, Ecuador allowed the oil company to resume operations on indigenous land. Resistance only grew, and with the help of social media gained the attention it needed. Further, the government was found responsible for human rights violations and failure to protect the people of Sarayaku whose lives were at risk during CGC operations. If some elements of this story sound familiar, they should. The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) in North Dakota is being built to enrich oil investors, with the unflinching support of armed government agents from multiple states. Sacred sites and burial grounds have already been destroyed by the oil company, and the pipeline is planned to be installed under Lake Oahe, threatening the water source of the Standing Rock Sioux. Militarized cops have used tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets, LRADs and other riot gear to crack down on the massive protests that have taken place to resist DAPL. Protesters have set up camps, as the Kichwa did in Ecuador, for a more permanent presence. But in the corporate oligarchy of the U.S., even the enormity of the protests are not enough to stop fossil fuel interests from getting their way. After all, they have to be paid back for the millions they are shelling out to act as militarized protection services for the company behind DAPL. Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people. We feel that PIVX is this system. PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people. It is the ultimate weapon in the battle against the money changers and information controllers because PIVX is the only cryptocurrency in existence that allows for completely anonymous storage while simultaneously paying interest.

It has been my privilege to visit and learn firsthand about the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and the Dakota Access Pipeline, and I appreciate the complexity of the conflict you currently manage. The Episcopal Church is grateful to stand with the people of Standing Rock in their efforts to respect and protect the Missouri River and the sacred burial grounds of the Sioux Nation. We do so seeking to follow the way of Jesus of Nazareth who taught us that love of God and love of our neighbor is the highest moral law and religious duty (Matthew 22:37-40, Luke 10:25-37). Hundreds of Episcopal clergy and lay leaders have traveled with other people of faith to Standing Rock over the past several months to bear non-violent witness to the water-protection efforts underway near Sacred Stone Camp. Reports from the ground from our own members present alarming accounts of undue force used by law enforcement against the water protectors. I also ask that you take action to address and stop the use of water cannons and rubber bullets, as well as the use of military equipment that escalates tensions between the parties. I am deeply concerned about the number of protectors who have been injured, and the potential loss of life that could result from the continued use of these tactics. A delegation of approximately 30 chaplains trained to assist people experiencing trauma will be standing with the water protectors in the coming days, especially as veterans also gather this weekend to stand with Standing Rock. These religious chaplains are called to care for those who are wounded, traumatized, or seeking spiritual support; they have pledged not to participate in demonstration activities. As they carry out their work, I ask that you safeguard them, ensuring that they meet no harm or violence as they seek to bring healing to all those gathered at Standing Rock. I close once again asking your patience, attention and respect for the people and communities in your care. Please trust that we will keep you in our prayers moving forward. If our church may be of assistance in the creation of a peaceful and just way forward, I would welcome that invitation. Faithfully, The Most Reverend Michael B. Curry Presiding Bishop and Primate of the Episcopal Church Tags Advocacy Peace & Justice, Dakota Access Pipeline, Indigenous Ministries, Presiding Bishop Michael Curry, Standing Rock Comments (46) Donna Jerome says: December 2, 2016 at 11:06 am Unfortunately, Really seems like the Episcopal Church is becoming a political lobbying organization. Brenda Harris says: December 2, 2016 at 11:45 am Fortunately I see a broad base of love that has come from the church to help assist those in need. We will help them maintain their optimal health and will help with their spiritual needs. We do stand with them and will help them. Catherine Cheek says: December 2, 2016 at 12:29 pm The Episcopal Church is carrying out the teachings of our Lord, Jesus Christ, to love and seek justice. If that is lobbying, I support it. Melissa L. Smith, PhD says: December 2, 2016 at 1:37 pm Doing what Jesus did, speaking up for the disenfranchised among us. Gayle Fisher-Stewart says: December 2, 2016 at 2:49 pm The Episcopal Church is following in the footsteps of Jesus; going to places where people are hurting, where people are living into who God has called them to be; challenging the status quo which says that some people are more important than others. I agree, if that is political lobbying, then count me in. Christine Draughon Wantland says: December 2, 2016 at 5:41 pm The Church has always stood for justice and the oppressed. I hope you will join us in this action because it is the only action that will bring us back together. Will Smith, MS says: December 2, 2016 at 7:39 pm Donna Jerome, In the Book of Common Prayer, pp. Richest blessings. Tad Tadlock says: December 2, 2016 at 7:53 pm There is a vast difference between political lobbying and following the teachings and example of Jesus. Without that commitment resulting in the willingness to stand against the politics of greed and the need to control, this country would still have laws on its books approving of and sustaining racism and other forms of injustice. Barbara Cavin says: December 3, 2016 at 10:52 am In a way, yes. Cynthia Bloomquist says: December 3, 2016 at 9:04 pm The Episcopal Church has alays supported the Christian value of nonviolaence. And support of the disdnfranchised. The first Episcopal Bishop in Minnesota two centuries ago, worked as a partner with the Chippewa. The MN Episcopal flag is a broken tomahawk and a cross combined. At devout ceremonies like the induction of Bishops, there are always drumming circles. So we have not become political suddenly. In the 60s and 70s we provided sanctuary for frightened immigrants. And to be witnesses and counselors in times of trauma. Christianity is not a passive thing. Episcoopal Community Services is always on the front lines. Kate Rose says: December 2, 2016 at 11:21 am Thank you Bishop, chaplain and water protectors. Elaine Wilson-Reddy says: December 2, 2016 at 11:45 am Thank you, Presiding Bishop Curry for asking for the monitoring and safety of the water protectors, the veteran protectors, and the chaplains. You are our role model in living the Jesus Movement. Catherine Cheek says: December 2, 2016 at 12:30 pm That is being done. It was mentioned in church last week. Nancy Mott says: December 3, 2016 at 11:45 am PB Curry is clear in his expressions of caring and prayer for persons of all sides AS PERSONS.

Kathleen Bleyaert, Ph.D. says: December 2, 2016 at 3:04 pm Bishop Curry, Thank you for guiding all of us to lovingly, compassionately, and directly address challenging situations. May we all continue to pray and try to find a constructive, respectful, and peaceful solution. Chaplains with special training and experience can bring a healing presence. Thank you for your strong and compassionate leadership regarding the travesty that is NODAPL. christine grem says: December 2, 2016 at 5:06 pm I encourage any one of white privlege to stand up not stand by and go pray and thank out water warriors. They will thank you for coming and there will be no violence when the crowd is filled with faces of many colors. John Miller says: December 2, 2016 at 7:16 pm Thank you Bishop Michael for your speaking out and offering a hand of reconciliation to the ND governor. I believe Jesus would be among those Native Americans and their other supporters. The Rev. Gayle Bridges, deacon says: December 2, 2016 at 10:27 pm I am very proud of the Episcopal Church and PB Michael Curry. I will pray for the chaplains that are going to Standing Rock. I wish I was going. But probably not physically able. I went for Katrina Relief in Louisiana twice for SAMSHA. We are one in Christ. Valerie Ohle says: December 3, 2016 at 2:08 pm I think Donna Jerome has the Episcopal Church confused with the churches and ministries of Franklin Graham, Jerry Falwell, John Hagee, Marcus Lamb, James Dobson, et al. Susan Fiore says: December 3, 2016 at 8:18 pm Our Presiding Bishop is not a toadie of money and power. Those who choose to remain ignorant about the impact of these pipelines, and oil itself, on our air, water and soil have no right to an opinion. Those who choose to put money and power ahead of our children and the future of our planet are among those whom Jesus called hypocrites, snakes and vipers, whited sepulchres. Christians are not called to be cowards, we are called to care for one another and creation itself. Kathryn Kerr says: December 3, 2016 at 10:08 pm Thank you, Bishop Curry for being the leader we need. It is clear from the comments that the work of Evangelism is still needed even within the Body of Christ called Episcopalians. If there is an allegiance higher in ones heart than the promises made at baptism then soul searching is needed. May we all stand with those who seek to do justice. The Episcopal Church is helping the victims in TN. Peace be with you. Carolyn Legg says: February 8, 2017 at 12:07 pm To quote the presiding Bishop, The Most Rev.

Only one problem remained: I had to find a way to go. I am not a man of means. I weighed obligations, such as bills and work, and considered travelling expenses. I glanced at my vehicle, already knowing it was hardly suited for the 1,100-mile drive from my home in north-east Oregon, and resigned myself to staying home. In early November, I was contacted by my good friend Jamie Stone, who said he wanted to go and offered his truck and trailer to haul supplies. Jamie also happens to be a former oil worker on the North Slope of Alaska. His uncle is an oil executive, and his brother works for oil companies around the globe, but he also has family members who are farmers in the midwest and have had easements forced across their own land for oil pipelines. I quickly agreed to the opportunity, but requested that we attempt to raise donations for the water protectors, the group of Native Americans representing over 300 different tribes who are encamped near the location where the pipeline is slated to cross the Missouri river. They had put out a call for donations of firewood and winter camping supplies. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Jack Walker, a tree care specialist from Oregon, cuts firewood to be donated to the water protectors. Where I live, in the wooded mountains of north-east Oregon, firewood is abundant. So the first thing I did was start reaching out to people for firewood donations. The response was overwhelming. Within 24 hours, we had reached our goal and acquired two more full-sized pickups and another trailer to accompany us. People also gave winter clothes, bulk food, horse feed and tack for the Sioux youth riders who have been active on the front lines of the movement since day one. Jack Walker, from Wallowa County, Oregon, was one of the people who donated. In the picture above, he is seen cutting firewood to take to Standing Rock. Chief Joseph, a leader in the Nez Perce war of 1877. Photograph: Public domain Wallowa County itself, much like the Standing Rock area, is home to one of the most tragic tales in American history and the Indian wars. Much as cities in the Dakotas are named for local tribes, Wallowa County and my hometown of Joseph are named for the people who had to endure atrocities committed by settlers eager to clear that land. The story of Chief Joseph, in particular, is yet another tale of a protector willing to sacrifice everything in the face of insurmountable odds. Chief Joseph was a leader in the Nez Perce war of 1877, in which his tribe and others opposed the US army. They were cut short not far from the border by a surprise flank attack in which much of the tribe was killed. All my friends are there. My father is buried there. Some of my children are buried there. I like the white people, but they have driven me out of my home. I have friendly feelings for all. My blood is the same that flows in the veins of the white men. We will all die just the same. Joseph was not allowed that right, and he died in exile. Cody is a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian reservation, which is not far from my home.

Photograph: Joe Whittle for the Guardian On the long drive into the Great Plains from the mountains and forests of our home, we talked of the days when his tribe and the Nez Perce would cross the continental divide and hunt bison, sometimes allying with the Sioux who lived on the plains, occasionally warring with them. Travelling those aisles of American history together felt surreal, considering where we were headed. History, it seemed, was repeating itself, only in a more modern form. When we finally arrived, it was dark and cold, and we were met by a security team. After the team made sure we were not intoxicated or bringing weapons, we were allowed in. Around 4,000 people are spread across roughly one-mile stretches of land on either side of the Cannonball river, which are filled with tipis, tents and a few RVs. My own daughter was fired at with rubber bullets while kneeling on the ground praying The sounds of Native American drum groups and songs echoed through the crisp air. Native people have survived 500 years of atrocity on this continent with the help of prayers, ceremony, and our community. We are steady in our promise to never give up on our cultural and spiritual relationship with the land and water we owe everything to. It is perhaps for this reason that despite the continuing war against our way of life, there is love, happiness and a deep spirituality at Oceti Sakowin Camp. In the distance, to my left, I could see the bright lights coming from a line of police cars behind the barricade, across State Highway 1806. To my right, high-powered floodlights near the Dakota Access pipeline (DAPL) construction site shone brightly, pointing at the camp all night long.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest DAPL floodlights point at the Oceti Sakowin camp from dusk until dawn. My own daughter, Mia, a 4.0-grade average student at Stanford University with a full-ride doctorate scholarship to any university in the world, was fired at with rubber bullets while kneeling on the ground praying. The following is the text message I received from her after a terrified night of watching live feeds on Facebook from my home back in Oregon: My friend was shot with a rubber bullet right next to me. Her auntie took care of us; she swiftly and strongly guided us back to the van where she was taken to the medics. She was a badass warrior. The women are all holding it down, that needs to be clear. They are the ones who get forgotten about in these movements, their importance needs to be emphasized. The entire area is considered a sacred area, and said to contain other graves. When construction began, water protectors made an attempt to occupy the location to protect it. Police responded with violent force and lined the shores of the Cannonball river under the hill, repelling people with rubber bullets and high powered pepper spray. Many people were injured. It was one of the most violent encounters of the ongoing resistance. Last week, Sophia Wilansky, 21, was seriously injured after being hit by a projectile when officers threw less-than-lethal weapons at demonstrators. She might lose her arm. They marched to the police roadblock, and performed a 21-gun salute for a fallen veteran and a prayer ceremony on the bridge. Many people are surprised to learn of the seeming irony of the fact that Native Americans possess more enrolled military members per capita than any other ethnicity in America. Law enforcement officers have, too. Former Wallowa County police officer Michelle Bloker joined the caravan from Oregon. Jeff Ginter, a former Department of Justice investigations officer and Homeland Security air marshall, was at Standing Rock during my time there. Retired after 30 years in law enforcement, Jeff has an easy way about him which would lend itself to de-escalation tactics as a police officer. It was needed. The abuses are many. My own brother Larry Whittle, a Marine Corps veteran of the Gulf war and enrolled member of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma, also decided to show solidarity at Standing Rock. On my fifth day there, he informed me that he would be joining the peaceful direct action. Their intent was to march peacefully down a county road to DAPL headquarters, where tribal elders would pray and hold ceremony to bless the sacred sites being disturbed by pipeline construction. The group was threatened by an angry local owner of a construction company called Four Square Concrete, who flew into a rage at having his drive home impeded by water protectors. After pushing into several protectors with his truck while laying on his horn and revving his engine, he pulled out a handgun and began pointing it at people. Before leaving the scene, he reached his gun out the window and fired seven rounds over the crowd. We used to go out there and listen to the spirits, really listen to what they had to say. Photograph: Joe Whittle for the Guardian He and his friends are the peaceful modern-day equivalent of the famous Great Plains horse warriors of yesteryear. It was their ancestors who defeated Gen Custer at the famous battle of the Little Bighorn. They have not only been instrumental in helping to initiate the movement, but also in leading and inspiring it. They have provided security for people in the camp and repeatedly protected elders during confrontations. One horse was shot twice with lethal ammunition by an unknown assailant during one protest encounter. Another horse was killed by rubber bullet impact from police during the first Backwater Bridge incident. Lakota leader Crazy Horse spoke of his vision of that prophecy with the following words: Upon suffering beyond suffering, the Red Nation shall rise again and it shall be a blessing for a sick world. A world filled with broken promises, selfishness and separations. A world longing for light again. I see a time of seven generations when all the colors of mankind will gather under the sacred Tree of Life and the whole Earth will become one circle again. In that day there will be those among the Lakota who will carry knowledge and understanding of unity among all living things, and the young white ones will come to those of my people and ask for this wisdom. So far, Standing Rock has seen visitors come from as far as Tibet, Japan, and New Zealand to offer support. Even the last remaining indigenous people of Europe, the Sami tribe, have sent representatives. People such as Lakota youth Phillip Wright believe the time Crazy Horse described is now. The Yellow Nation, the Red Nation, the Black Nation, and the White Nation, all came together. There is a sense of history in the making. This is what they were probably talking about. They were calling us, warning us about something. No one at the camp really wants to think about the possibility of the pipeline crossing the river.

Wes Clark Jr. is the man behind the three-day deployment of U.S. military veterans to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The standoff between the protesters and the law continues to escalate, resulting in horrific injuries to protesters. He is also a former Army officer who is openly and thoroughly disgusted with the violence being inflicted upon his fellow Americans. And to Clark, it seems obvious that veterans should continue their service to their country by stepping up and stepping in. The two hope to draw scores of veterans, along with fire fighters, ex-law enforcement officers, and others to Standing Rock for their deployment. And, considering their background, there is no reason to doubt them. Deployment To Standing Rock Was A Last Resort Phyllis Young, a Sioux Tribal elder, is the one who got Clark initially involved. Young, who grew up on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, believes the future resides in the fight. And we have to help keep it in balance for as long as we can. I am a mother and a grandmother. Yet, much of what he attempted never panned out. He attempted to assemble a legal team for the Standing Rock Reservation inhabitants. But none of it went anywhere. Veterans who have spent their lives putting themselves in danger for their love of country, to protect their own. And this battle would be no different. Clark did explain that the plan is to maintain a non-violent presence. The funds will be used solely to help volunteers with transportation costs, and bailing volunteers out of jail, when needed. The following morning they will join members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, including Young, for a traditional healing ceremony. With an eye toward the media, old military uniforms will be donned so that if the veterans are brutalized by the police, they are brutalized not as ordinary citizens, but as people who once served the government they are protesting against. Bagpipes will play, and traditional Sioux war songs will be sung. The music will continue as everyone marches together to the banks of the Missouri, on the other side of which a line of guards in riot gear will be standing ready with rifles, mace, batons, and dogs. The ultimate goal, the two veterans say, is to make it to the drilling pad and surround it. But with body armor and gas masks, as well as a cadre of trained veterans, this attempt may be harder to stop. Wood and Clark are willing to go to whatever lengths it may take.

The grenade explosion caused bone, muscles and arteries to be blown from her arm, according to her father, Wayne Wilansky.

It's going to stay in pathology until it's needed. There's proof. The police have changed the story of how Ms. Wilansky was hurt three times, according to her father. He also said police are intentionally hurting people in an attempt to deter new protesters from joining those already at Standing Rock. The authorities blocked medical help from reaching injured protesters, according to Mr. Wilansky. Despite her injury, Ms. Wilansky has asked that the attention be kept on the people of Standing Rock. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has been fighting to stop the 1,170 mile Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) for seven months. DAPL is planned to go under the Missouri River just a half-mile north of the Standing Rock reservation. The reservation already faces significant issues, including rates of unemployment, poverty, overcrowded housing, premature deaths, and a suicide rate that are all much higher than the national average. One protester who spoke at the vigil had just returned from Standing Rock and said that police were firing directly at protesters who were posing no threat to law enforcement or to property. He also asked for everyone to call their local and federal representatives to say the violence towards protesters at Standing Rock must end. This is not the way we behave.

Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome. These fossil fuel corporations want to make money with any means. They do not respect anything but nice profits. These greedy people have bribed our governmental agencies to protect their profits as the cost of global warming, as they deny the rights of the indigenous people to control their land. Standing Rock is on the land of the native people. This is not debatable. The government of the United States does not own this land. The United States has been stealing the native people's land and killing them since the Europeans invaded this land. They did not 'discover' it. The people who were here are the ones who own it. They were deprived of their lands for religious reasons. Killing them was just fine. This proclamation by the Pope in the 15th century is the base of all of our laws on the ownership of land in our nation---and it is past time to over rule this doctrine of the Pope. It's terrifying. That's probably the right word if they're deliberately hurting people to scare others away. At the same time I'm alarmed at how easily the media is ignoring this show (in contrast to the southern civil rights movement, which was on the news every day), I'm also concerned, along with many here, about the degree to which law enforcement is militarized in the US. Both developments do not bode well for the future. One thing they have learned is to control the message. The media, today, is highly concentrated in a few hands. We do not have the diversity of mainstream news sources that existed in the 1950', 1960's and 1970's. In sum, the deck is stacked heavily and systematically against the people. Yet, we MUST CONTINUE TO FIGHT against the oppression of the ruling capitalist class. That mindset is the CIA's, the politicians they control, the Deep State. They spread the fear that makes many weak and hysterical. That's how it was done in Germany. We're up to about 1935 and climbing. Fast. Israeli soldiers are deliberately shooting young Palestinian men in the kneecap, to create a generation of cripples. Now we are imitating the worst of Israel, and their worst is very bad indeed. And yes, the comparison of Israel and Germany in the 30s has come to many people's minds. Not the 1940s - not yet. That mindset is the CIA's, the politicians they control, the Deep State. They spread the fear that makes many weak and hysterical. That's how it was done in Germany. We're up to about 1935 and climbing. Fast. Trump is most likely a fascist, but Obomber is allowing fascist, Police State violence against these water protectors. Trump is most likely a fascist, but Obomber is allowing fascist, Police State violence against these water protectors. Absolutely. He quietly resumed the militarization of police a couple of months ago. He should read up on LBJ because he'll leave office about as popular. I am mailing a donation to the standing rock Sioux protesters now. And the glory of all those who have fought and died for basic civil rights in our country will forever be tainted by the legacy of our first African-America n president who sat by and did NOTHING as the civil rights crisis at Standing Rock unfolded before him for months. The recent election of Trump, the orange buffoon, has thrown a wrench in their plans. I predict he will most likely be a good puppet and do what it is they want him to do. However, Trump is kind of a wild card. Don't hold your breath... either way it is going to be a hard row to hoe as the super powerful banking interests own our nation and none of the usual expected leaders(Clinton , Bush, Reid, Gingrich, Ryan, Pelosi, Boxer, McConnell, et al) will do anything that may challenge the wealthy elites who have the real power. Hard times... . There are many reasons why voters repudiated the Democratic party. Obama must take a huge part of that responsibility- -after, of course, Hillary herself. Go to a meeting and just ask they have considered the optionif electric vehicles. If we can cut our daily use of fossil fuels even one quarter it would make projects like DAPL unprofitable. I signed up with Arcadia power. All my energy money goes to wind. In January, I will be putting some of it to a solar panel project in Massachusetts. Folks, if a Texas State council is saying this, you must know it is true. It is not to provide people with needed energy; it is to enrich the capitalist class who would rather see the extinction of the human race than lose money in their investments in fossil fuels. I hope there is a special place in hell reserved for them, and ALL of those in government who protect them and pass laws to enable them to continue their destruction of the planet. The time to stop this pipeline was in court before construction, not when all of the legal right-of-ways have been signed and recorded. Too bad the schools didn't teach honest history 50-60 years ago, and still don't. It has it's shortcomings, but it also has more unvarnished truth than almost any ten HS or college history textbooks put together. Trucks carry 200 barrels of oil. I would prefer that my government let the market prevail, which would soon shut down all of the fossil fuel infrastructure. This is a rare case in which the transparent and unsubsidized market really WOULD create optimum outcomes. I do not trust the market to care about inequality. I would like to nationalize the energy sector completely. Corporations that are now running the government. That is living in fantasy. Nationalizing will just be the same as privatizing, because the privatizers are now running the government. They're still destroying net neutrality in spite of the government allegedly running it. Because I'm not well-to-do and can't pay for premium service. It is wind and solar. No spills, no crashes. We can all read it and weep... . Trucks carry 200 barrels of oil. Would rather have wind , solar, geothermal as in civilized countries. Very sickening. This is why those two countries stand alone... Murdering civilians en masse and using collective punishment is sickening this day and age. He's talking about U.S. police being trained by Israel, which IS happening on an increasing scale. So, it's not bigoted AT ALL to state that FACT. Your argument, is just a call for the government to get more involved and clean up the fuel source used. A lot of the protestors LIVE THERE. A lot of them are farmers. I know farmers in that area who are freaked out about this. If there's no clean water to drink, it doesn't matter what you drive, unless it's a hearse. Oil Lovers (Pump Huggers) are hypocrites if they eat food or drink water. If they want to start that argument, they need to be prepared to take it to its logical conclusion. None of us want oil-fueled transportation. TPTB go to great lengths to limit other alternatives on behalf of the vested interests. Free market my bleeding hemorrhoids. No need to revert to horses. Guess who the terrorists are -and always have been since the Mayflower hit the east coast and were fed and warmed by the Pequot (I think).

Sounds like plot elements of a movie exposing the evil activities of KGB or Natzi Storm Troopers. But wait, the plot thickens: we're soon to be Ruled by a monster who says water boarding is the least of what his administration intends to utilize. Guess he is waiting until the DAPL ruptures UNDER the Missouri. Because pipelines & oil trains, etc are DISASTERS WAITING TO HAPPEN. Always. But if the original Selma happened today, we'd never know, because the corporate media would cover it just as much as Standing Rock--that is to say, not at all, unless skewed against the protesters. Because that media is owned by the same corporations that fund the politicians, that are building the pipeline, and that are allowed to use OUR police forces and National Guard against us, U.S. citizens, as their private hired goons. The pipeline was moved so that it wouldn't inconvenience and jeopardize whites in Bismarck, to run across UNCEDED indigenous land per the 1851 Ft. Laramie treaty. It's theirs. They are a sovereign nation (while also being U.S. citizens). There is NOTHING legal, much less moral, about any of this on the part of the government, much less the corporations. Carbon from life forms is isotopically different than carbon coming up out of the magma.There are already thousands of miles of leaking pipelines with some 100 leaking under the one percenter's rivers in the U.S. A fundamentalist is anyone who makes a slave of women or children or old people. It certainly isn't the people, so obviously it is being created by the government, local, state and federal; and the former are doing so with the support of the latter. So, We the People aren't the ones instigating this domestic warfare, it is the government. No, an increasing number of us must rise up more and more against all of this trampling on our liberty, freedom, rights and livelihood. I would like to believe that many would remember when an Iranian Basij sniper shot Neda Agha-Soltan on the 20th of June, 2009 during protests of Muhamoud Ahmadinejad. I suspect that the cowardly police shot. threw or launched the flashbang grenade knowing full well that it exploding near Sophia Wilansky's body could cause great harm and even death. This is straight up intimidation, meant to keep all other non-Natives acting in solidarity with the large group of Native water protectors. The last thing that Enbridge wants is for the protests and resistance to grow in popularity and stop the eventual destruction of the water aquifers. It is the capitalist way. God bless America .

BuzzFeed News identified more than 60 Facebook pages with more than 6 million fans that are generating money either by selling counterfeit Native American merchandise, or by driving traffic to ad-filled websites that in some cases have little or nothing to do with Native American issues. Native designers say their work is being stolen and resold, and that some pages falsely claim to donate proceeds to the protesters at Standing Rock. He said some Facebook pages have even taken photos of his models and photoshopped different clothing on them. Erica Moore with two people wearing one of her Standing Rock T-shirt designs. She said copies of her designs soon began showing up on Facebook and elsewhere. BuzzFeed News tracked some of the worst offending Facebook pages to owners in Vietnam. It promotes its T-shirts by photoshopping them on celebrities such as The Rock, Johnny Depp, Mark Wahlberg, and others. Many of its recent posts about clothing comment on the Standing Rock protest, though there is no evidence that the people running the page donate any proceeds to the protesters. BuzzFeed News messaged the page on Facebook and the person who replied introduced themselves as a woman in Michigan named Maria Torres who claims to be Native American on her Facebook profile. The profile appears to only have been created in March of this year and primarily shares merchandise being promoted by the Like If You Love Native Americans page. The account also reposts content and merchandise from a page called Wolves In Native American Culture which points to a domain name registered to the same person in Vietnam. The person then denied stealing designs from Native artists. The person said they simply find Native American T-shirts that have already been uploaded to SunFrog and collect them on one page, earning a commission each time they sell. SunFrog is one of several websites that enable anyone to to upload a design and then offer print-on-demand ordering for a range of clothing. He pointed to a form on its website that anyone can use to make a claim. He also said anyone who falsely claims to sell clothing in support of a cause will have their account closed and SunFrog will donate their earnings to charity. Yodzevicis said SunFrog has seen an increase in infringing designs and false charity claims related to Standing Rock. One of the bigger pages identified by BuzzFeed News is called Indigenous People of America and has over 750,000 fans. It shares a steady stream of news related to events in Standing Rock, but under many of its posts it also promotes the sale of a knockoff of a shirt created by actor Shailene Woodley to raise funds for Standing Rock. The only official seller of the Woodley shirt is Omaze, yet the design can be found for sale on many other online clothing sites as well as on Amazon. SunFrog removed a version of the shirt for sale on its site after being alerted to it by BuzzFeed News, though other copies of the design remain for sale on the site. Another big Facebook page hawking inauthentic Native American goods is Native American Indians, which has over 360,000 fans and promotes merchandise from a store called NativeThing.com. Once they receive their order people realize it was made in China, gives off a noxious odor, and that the company subsequently refuses to accept returns. Many other pages pursue a similar strategy of building up an audience with Native content and then trying to sell them shirts and other items that are often rip-offs of Native designs. One newer page is called I Stand with Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and shares a steady diet of news about the protest mixed with constant pleas for people to show their support by buying shirts for the cause. The page did not respond to a question about whether it donates any money to the tribe. Along with stealing the work of Native artists, and the likenesses of models and celebrities, some scammers even used a photo of the first Native American federal judge to create fake profiles to help spread their content. Her photo has been used on at least three fake Facebook profiles, one of which lists its two only friends as two young men in Kosovo. One of the largest networks of Native American Facebook pages initially identified by BuzzFeed News belonged to two young men in Kosovo. At the time of the interview, their pages had close to 2 million fans. However, after speaking to BuzzFeed News all of their pages were taken offline. where Dardan and a partner publish clickbait articles about a wide variety of topics, though rarely about Native Americans. Dardan did not respond to a subsequent Facebook message from BuzzFeed News asking why they had removed their Native American Facebook pages. BuzzDuzz is still publishing as of this writing. Some of the Native American designers who spoke to BuzzFeed News said the non-Natives running the pages and selling stolen designs are making more money than they are. Aaron Silva, a Native American and the co-founder of The NTVS clothing brand in Minnesota, said the dubious Native American sellers often have one or several large Facebook pages to use to promote the merchandise. Silva also said these pages spend money to create sponsored Facebook posts that promote the item for sale to large numbers of people. One of its current sponsored posts shows photos of Bernie Sanders and celebrities with the Shailene Woodley shirt. This sponsored post for a stolen design has received over 125,000 reactions, 15,000 comments, and close to 18,000 shares as of this writing. It had over 33,000 reactions, nearly 4,000 comments, and over 8,000 shares. These sponsored posts also help grow the number of fans for that page: When BuzzFeed News first found the Native American Cultures page roughly two weeks ago, it had just over 57,000 fans. It now has over 72,000. It has close to 12,000 reactions, just over 500 comments, and 2,100 shares as of this writing. The comment thread was soon filled with people sharing other examples of suspect pages, and of designers talking about how they too had their work stolen. Silva and others have also tried to contact T-shirt sites such as SunFrog and TeeChip to get their designs removed. They said the takedown forms and procedures take up a lot of their time. Yodzevicis from SunFrog said their reporting form has only a few fields to complete and submissions are checked roughly every hour. He also said the company is working to implement a procedure whereby any money earned from a stolen design will be sent to the original artist. Silva said Facebook is easier to deal with, but that it only removes the offending post rather than an entire page. Yazzie has also tried directly contacting the Facebook pages that promote his stolen designs for sale. But at most he says they will delete the post with his design and just upload it again later. For his part, Silva is amazed at how so many people in different parts of the world have discovered that dubious Native American Facebook pages, websites, and merchandise can be a moneymaker.

Done Editing Tags Share this article 21 21 21 Police blockade at the northern end of the Backwater Bridge by the camps of the Water Protectors at Standing Rock, ND I visited Standing Rock from November 12th to the 14th. My mission was to photograph the actions in order to help document this amazing, impactful, peaceful uprising. Survival of the water protectors is the story to be told. Note: this is the second of a multipart account of a visit to the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota. Each week a new part will be published by the author. Oceti Sakowin Camp is the largest water protector encampment at Standing Rock Reservation. Food, sanitation, health and mental health services are provided. A midwifery tent takes care feminine health. Life at camp is defined by work. Part of this are the actions. People wake up early, before sunrise, for prayer ceremonies. After that, those who will participate in actions are organized and given direction as to where to go. On the day the article was being written, a confrontation took place. It was serious, and many people were injured. To read more about this, please click here. A person involved with the actions told me that they would go to different locations. Most of the actions involved obstructing the pipeline construction. Therefore, these actions are making it very costly to build there, which also incentivizes the builders to build elsewhere, away from the water. Other actions taking place are protests not at the pipeline construction. A day after my arrival, I heard of events in Bismarck. On the news, I saw a protest at the building housing the Army Corps of Engineers. Regardless, these actions are all peaceful and they stay on message. Although the actions take most of the news coverage, they are not the only thing that camp residents do. There is a lot of work done at the camp by a large number of people who do not participate in the actions. Food, for instance, is a major endeavor. A very large kitchen sits in the middle of the camp, relatively close to the main entrance. The kitchen is equipped with a massive, covered grill. Everything is cooked on it. California State Assemblymember-Elect Ash Kalra (D-San Jose) told me that when he visited the camp with a small delegation from the South Bay, he saw a whole squash being grilled. Another resident told me that she brought elk when she arrived at the camp. This too was cooked on the grill. The pantry is extensive, and it includes everything from buckets of flour, to pallets with fruits and vegetables, to other goods. A large truck provides water to camp residents. Chopping wood for the grill is a very important task that never ends. The wood is chopped daily and constantly. The need for firewood in the cold nights is such that the wood for the grill needs to be protected. Therefore, a large sign indicating that the wood was only for the kitchen was necessary. Wood has become quite relevant in the camp. There is wood everywhere. First, of course, is the wood used for cooking and heating. But structures are being built in preparation of winter. The sound of power tools can be heard from almost everywhere. Now, the police are cracking down on that, with what I believe is a stratagem to prevent the water protectors from resisting throughout the brutal North Dakota winter. The police are a constant presence at the camp. The camp is located on the south side of the Backwater Bridge that crosses a segment of the Missouri River. For a visual of the bridge, click here. This is about one hour south of Bismarck. Police enforcement is located at the north end of the bridge. The satellite antennas protruding off the command trucks are imposing, though. The command unit, from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, is located between the camp and the casino, at the intersection of Highway 24. I never realized it was the Bureau of Indian Affairs until I stopped to take the picture. The lettering of the BIA was very small in comparison. I wonder why the BIA was there siding with the police. It shocked me to see that the BIA was on the wrong side of the equation. Anywhere from 20 to 50 police cars can be seen on their side of the bridge. Google Earth only shows very old photos, so this is not a conspiracy to hide anything from the public. All the camps are considered to be sanctuaries for the water protectors. The police cannot come in, and as long as one is in the camp, one is technically safe. Yet, the ever-present visual of the cops, plus flyovers by unmarked aircraft, make it impossible to forget that the camps are technically under siege. At least twice a day a helicopter or a propeller plane, sometimes both, fly at extremely low altitudes over the camps, especially the main one. Both types of aircraft are painted yellow and white, and have no kind of identification numbers whatsoever. On normal planes, there are numbers painted on the underside of the wings, which work as license plates of sort. The same is true of normal helicopters. As a result of these aircraft having no identifiable markings, there is no way by which anyone outside of law enforcement can 100 percent positively identify them or who they belong to or represent. This law enforcement anonymity is representative of the constant pressure that camp residents live under. Just to illustrate how bad it can get, on my first day I focused my photography outside of the camp. I walked up the road, ND 1806, northwards. I had no idea what I would find there. I saw beautiful vistas of the camp, especially Turtle Island, which I began to photograph. Then, I went back to the freeway and continued to travel north on the bridge. I eventually found the leftovers from previous confrontations. There was a burnt car, and up ahead were two incredibly large trucks that had also been set on fire. They were so burnt and twisted that at first I was unable to recognize what kind of trucks they were. On the other hand, it was painfully obvious that those trucks now formed a blockade between the factions. I walked towards the trucks, trying to figure out how to best photograph them. I reached an orange line on the ground that was spray painted. It was very clear to me what it meant: do not cross this line. Nothing else indicated that, no signs and no warnings, but my instinct guided me. Later I knew I was right to not even step on it. Some people told me that that line was indeed a boundary. I photographed the best I could. I was trying to get a shot of the bridge, the burnt trucks, and the line of police cars behind the trucks. The molten pavement and the graffiti on it caught my attention, so I photographed those too. When I was done taking pictures, I noticed a wall of people on the road behind me. I became excited that maybe an action was going to take place right there and then, so I rushed back to them. I saw a man looking at me, smiling, and trying to get to me. I smiled back, and once he reached me he asked me about the cops. Two on one side, and three on the other; or so I was told. I was so focused on what I was doing, so lost in my art, that I lost any sense of my surroundings. I entered the creative vacuum where the only thing that matters is the subject, and nothing else. Only inspiration exists. The man explained to me that this was the reason everyone had congregated on the road, and on a small hill on the side of the road. There must have been about 100 people all together who came to possibly rescue me from the police. Granted, most people I talked to just saw a crowd forming and decided to check what was going on. The camp is considered a safe place. The road between the camp and the bridge is considered a safe place. Yet the police presence is omnipresent and hard to forget. And if you happen to get lost in the daily activities of the camp, a plane or a helicopter will remind you. Be it building shelters, erecting teepees, chopping wood, cooking, providing care to others -be it medical or legal- people in the camp are busy. Being busy is an excellent distraction from the tension of their situation. No one is there for a nice vacation with the kids -and if they are, they should leave. This is a dangerous situation for all involved. All it could take is a careless photographer for the tensions to explode and a confrontation to begin. We all need this illusion in order to survive. If the illusion were to be shattered by the reality of a raid or something like that, we will find ourselves in an apocalyptic world of the horrors of injustice that all seek to avoid. Therefore, the illusion of safety is essential to survival in this crazy dystopic reality."}, {"URL": "https://act.credoaction.com/sign/Standing_Rock_monument?sp_ref=250468002.4.177258.f.562071.3", "Timestamp": "20180919010720", "Sentences": "Credo Action Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument.

For instance, opposing the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Keystone XL. Mossett: Well, I mean, you can kinda look at this from a historical context too and see that especially as Native American people we have been at the forefront of the conflict since the beginning of colonization. Um, being here in our home territories and then having people come in and tell us what we can or can not do, uhm, ((laughs)). So you know, this has been a struggle for over five hundred years, if you think about it in a historical context. So I think that when it comes to, uh, these fossil fuel infrastructure industries citing where they put uh, refineries or where they put extractive industry, pipelines, that a lot of times it just so happens to be in our um, communities as well. Which today, in this day and age, we have reservations that the government established, that they put us on. These industries, uh, force us into this conflict by continually putting our health at risk and the lives of our children at risk by contaminating water sources. So, I hope that that answers that. Right with Bismarck wanted though, it was moved. Um. The oil is not flowing through the pipeline; they might have put oil in there. Because they are going to have to look at a possible reroute or look at some other form of um, of infrastructure. The only thing that is helping them greatly right now is that we are in this Trump administration. ((laughs)) E: Right. I think that it had um, had it been anybody else it would have been a different circumstance already. And so there is a lot of different behind the scenes things that are happening with this company where their not being completely honest with everybody. And it was supposed to have been at least by April 1st, at least is what they told their shareholders. Gosh, it sometimes feels like it because we fought so hard to have clean drinking water. And we felt like the Obama administration was finally listening, that it was a small victory, and so something unprecedented happened when Donald Trump came in, which was to just completely forgo the environmental impact statement process in which there were already thousands and thousands, maybe even hundred of thousands of comments that were submitted. So there is a lot of unprecedented things happening. E: Yeah,everything seems upside down. But let me ask, however the Dakota Access Pipeline comes out, you definitely had a unique confluence of tribes and also some unexpected allies, like military veterans opposing the pipeline. Mossett: I feel like underneath the Trump administration we are actually building stronger alliances because people that are like minded are coming together, we might not have the exact same sturggles. And in the past we might have been a bit more segregated as a result of that, but now, because everyone is under attack we are joining forces together, um against the administration that does seem to be making everything upside down. And so, I feel like the alliance is going the be strengthened, even more, as the days go on. Um, indeed as the years go on. And the thing is is that people are finally getting it, um its not just a nimby issue, you know not in my backyard. And so even though, traditionally and historically it was low income communities, people of color communities that were the first and worst impacted, and still are, we are not the only ones anymore. And that we are not segregated we are not separate. That includes the Koch brothers, I mean that even includes all the stuff that is happening in Russia, and a lot of the conversations that have been being had or around, his influence in the fossil fuel sector, wanting to open up, um drilling in Alaska or in Anmore, or in the artic, and he may have been working with-with Russian ties, to say yeah you can drill here if you help me get elected. So we got, there is a lot of crooked corruption going on as well. But this is calling it out. And so the battleground right now is definitely Nebraska making sure that it stops again with Nebraska. And there are a lot of really strong landowners and people that came together the first time to stop it which is why we were so successful. And in fact the reason why that Dakoda access pipeline was so rushed and just ramrodded through was because of Keystone XL. The other thing is that the Trump administration said that the Dakota access pipeline the Keystone XL pipeline would have to use American still. Why are we approving it. Why are we approving the Keystone XL. The thing is is that people are pulling out of tar sands projects you know Shell. E: Right, the tar sands are probably the worst, the heaviest environmental impact of any kind of oil. And then you have really, well you could call it a unique alliance of say landowners and tribes, becoming less unique. Mossett: It is, it is, it used to be it was the cowboy and Indian alliance. When we first were fighting the Keystone XL. And so we said we still have it. And so it just is sometimes it just takes people to have to go through it to really understand. E: And of course the other key part of the alliance environmental group such as Earth justice your club or 350.org. But historically there has been some tension in the environmental groups, were seen as elite and out of touch. But seem to be working better these days So can you comment on the reasons for this alliance, the strength of the alliance. Mossett: Sure. I mean the Indigenous Environmental Network has been around since 1990 as an official organization. Prior to that you know we were a part of the American Indian Movement and we have been sort of loosely forums for so many decades. But I think that the discourse happened because we coined the term environmental justice. We talked about how we were impacted in our communities and what happened was a lot of these bigger organizations in the front end. And I think these organizations now are getting it. This is years and years and years of base building and community outreach and really understanding the struggles that people are facing in their communities and how it impacts their families. So I think that we were able to learn from each other, as organizations, so they learn from us how to build community. Which is a clean energy future for for everyone. ((laughs)) E: Getting there, not 100 percent. E: Great, since you bring up environmental justice I do want to bring up the African-American influence on environmental justice from the beginning starting in the 1980s. And of course keeping stuff like incinerator out of African-American or minority communities. Mossett: Oh yes. Yesterday April 4th which is the anniversary of when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his beyond Vietnam speech. He talked about denouncing poverty racism military-ism and then one year later he was assassinated. And so what we did was launch something called the majority and this group called the majority has indigenous groups, Black Lives Matter groups urban and rural groups, climate justice alliances. Were all coming together because we understand the necessity to build each other up. And that is because historically there was a fight for an eight-hour work day that goes all the way back to 1886 in Chicago where were striking workers had a had a run in with the police. And there were several deaths. And so this whole this group of ours the majority is calling to light the historical context and to the light the fact that these things were never remediated fully you know and that we still have a way to go in the struggle and to not forget our history. E: And the definition of sustainability is often not just environmental, it also includes social justice and uh, economic equity. Mossett: Right. But, um, this seems all part of the same movement. We were the first ones here. We were heavily impacted. And it just has continued since then. It goes back to that historical context. E: Right. But climate change is global. We tell our traditions stories, or oral stories based upon where we live. You know how can you how can you live on the land that belongs to all of us. Yet we remain we still have our stories we still have our culture we still have our language. And we have people saying and this is what we know from our own communities. How can we join together in the struggle to make it stronger. Probably a lot of that has to do with technology. So I think that our alliance is heading in the right direction when it comes to the power of visiting and the power of connecting. We just have to be really careful and really mindful of how we move and where we move. And what that looks like is getting back to the small scale thinking and doing of of our everyday lifestyle. Small scale distributed wind and solar on each home, you know instead of a huge solar plant or huge wind farm because when you start getting corporate It inevitably becomes negative. We need to get back to small scale community style living which can happen even in urban settings that simply can happen by community gardens. In each block. So the block can come together as a community with their garden and talk to each other and learn about where their food sources are coming from. You know the earth is 4.6 billion years old. Our lifespan is the blink of an eye. And now we have the scientific facts behind us. You know that love of the land that everybody has and just how people to remember basically where they come from.

Jacqueline Patterson is the director of the NAACP Environmental and Climate Justice Program. She says she recognized environmental injustice decades ago while working in Jamaica, where Shell Oil contaminated community water supplies. Then later, while volunteering in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, she saw another side of the inequity in climate disaster response. This is the kind of conversation I hope people are having all over the country and, indeed, the planet. Bill McKibben: Tell a bit of your story. And one of the communities I was working with, they had their water supply contaminated by Shell Oil. And they just wanted to fund a few ventilated pit latrines and give some money to the school. From there I connected with NAACP. The first couple of months I was doing these intro-to-climate-justice workshops at these regional trainings the NAACP has. But many people had little framework for hearing it. Climate was so hard to fit into what NAACP usually did. More people anyway. So many people have so many different capacities, knowledge, skills. Put yourself in service to the leadership of those on the front line. So join your local NAACP chapter. If you could help map out some of the groups, help them understand the connection between fracking and seismic activity. If you can look at the Florida situation and look at the increase in sinkholes, help people understand that sea level rise is affecting the limestone and making sinkholes more likely. He has severe asthma. Another one shows him looking out the window and watching kids go to school. I talk about the connection between the very facility that is driving climate change and the increased concentration of pollutants that come from climate change. Or they might be drinking it from their water supply. I want people to see all those levels of risk kids have from these impacts. And I overlay that with the fact that when you have this many problems, including living next to a toxic facility, on average your property values are 15 percent lower. And then I show an image of a child standing on a milk crate being fingerprinted. And then the same entities that fight against the regulations to help the air are the same entities pushing forward punitive criminal justice measures, and privatizing our prisons, and so on. People see that through the lens of an actual child, how all those systems come into play. How they come into play against his chance to be a thriving adult. Patterson: Well, climate change might be big enough to help us start reimagining things. Usually by the time I finish describing the problem side of my presentations, most people are properly depressed, but when I get on the transformation side, I start to talk about how these systems are predicated on exploitation of natural resources and of human resources. Or humans, period. And how climate change is really a byproduct of this systematic world of winners and losers. And then we talk about the ways we really need to flip this on its head. We talk about how when we have a system based on capitalism, by definition it means there are winners and losers. And communities of color, women, and so on are on the losing end. System by system, we talk about it. As we are taking back our democracy by overturning Citizens United and getting money out of politics and so on, we also have to be the change we want to see in the world, even before our political system catches up. So, the things that the Institute for Local Self-Reliance does around helping us develop recycling systems, our own energy systems, our own food systems. How we shift power away from the Monsantos, the Exxons. We have to do it all at the same time. Patterson: There are a lot of sensitivities around even using the term. People have lost their lives for not being able to pay for electricity. Ideally, their bills would go down. They need to feel that they have a choice, a choice that feels like it enables them to provide a similar level of support to their families and doing work that is fulfilling to them. Because the whole town is built on that coal. Patterson: Well, I think a willingness to work together. They had to eat together and shovel together, while trusting that they were all working toward these common aims. They had to work through any roadblocks, literally and figuratively."}, {"URL": "https://www.news-journal.com/news/2016/nov/22/cannonball-heartland-magical-history-tour/", "Timestamp": "20180919011030", "Sentences": "Please log in, or sign up for a new account and purchase a subscription to continue reading.

Winds light and variable. I am on the edge of the encampment, looking out across the prairie. A full super-moon rises over the Cannonball, washing out the stars. To the north is high ground, commanded by a line of bright generator-powered floodlights. That is the perimeter of the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site. The call is echoed back from among the tipis, tents, yurts, and other improvised structures. That child's family is dug in for the North Dakota winter. Their encampment is surrounded by a circle of steel fencing, the kind you'd make a temporary corral of, lashed with tarps as a windbreak. The weather has been sunny and unseasonably warm, with highs in the 50s. Many additional campers have driven in from all across America. License plates from New York and Oregon, Texas and Minnesota. The flags of many Native American tribes fly, marking a central avenue. We share a campfire with our neighbors. A young white guy, an acupuncturist from St. Paul. A Southern Cheyenne photojournalist from Trinidad, Colorado. A woman born in China, who teaches English poetry in a college, and who travels the world collecting Buddhist-style prayer flags from rivers around the world, from people living near the Yangtze and the Ganges, and the Ohio and Illinois. She's strung those flags from brush near our campsite. I have come to see and listen, and to bear gifts. When I announced my intention, the response was generous and humbling. People started giving me money and food. I bore a cargo of goods and their love. I bought propane, an indoor heater, and a lot of canned goods. Peas, corn, beans, tuna, noodles, sausages, and four cases of SPAM. I only eat SPAM every 20 years, but the next morning I had the stuff with oatmeal for breakfast. I will leave behind the new down bag I purchased. More white than native people are camping, though most of them will not stay the winter. White people work the kitchens supplying food for free, and sort mounds of clothing and gear donations. I don't go to the confrontation site where people are arrested. People in camp are quiet and generous and gentle. Drinking, drugs, and guns are not allowed. It's not a festival atmosphere. I walked across camp in the moonlight, in my new Carhartt jacket too heavy for Texas winters. A group of Native Americans paraded, softly beating a drum and singing. White people walked behind them. I joined them. We walked about a mile to the riverside, where there was a huge bonfire, and more singing. No speeches. It was the quietest walk with a couple thousand people I've ever taken. Looked at from one perspective, there's a logic to the pipeline being built. But the Native Americans are being asked to bear risks and suffer violation with no benefit. It's a sad old story. For white people, the western expansion is an epic; for the native peoples, a tragedy. I don't really expect the American Indians to prevail. But I share their love for Creation, So I've decided to make the drive, to offer food and warmth, and to stand for a while with them at Standing Rock.

This is a lightly edited transcript. The announcement that the Army Corps of Engineers would withhold an easement permit for the last part of the Dakota Access Pipeline, pending an environmental impact study, is a significant moment that should nonetheless not be mistaken for the end of either that environmental or that historical story. She joins us by phone from Chicago. Welcome to CounterSpin, Kelly Hayes. Kelly Hayes: Thank you so much for having me. KH: Well, I was saying to some folks in a direct action workshop just the other day that we have to understand victory as coming in stages, always. But as storytellers, we have to recognize that our victories are not just climactic, in the way that an outside view might understand them. Our people have been throwing down for eight months now. A number of my friends have been staying out there, and have made a home there for more than five months on, and some of my friends are actually day one individuals. So missing that deadline creates a point of weakness that can be exploited, that can be dug into deeper, by those of us who want to make sure this pipeline never happens. If anything, the only thing that was maybe finitely accomplished here was that the Obama administration came up with a maneuver that will remove this as a stain from the legacy of an outgoing president. And we have heard from experts that it would be a matter of hours, if Trump were determined to do so, for him to dismantle these gains that we have recently made. But we are at a very critical time, and mischaracterizing this as the larger battle being won risks us falling from the headlines, risks this entire story being pushed out of public view. It took a whole lot of fighting, it took a whole lot of people getting hurt and really living this struggle, in order for this to be seen. The truth is, they are more vulnerable now than they have ever been, in terms of money getting shut off. We have millions of dollars that have been moved already through move-your-money campaigns, to get people to divest from banks that are supporting the pipeline. We need to hit on that front harder than ever. We need people to disrupt their banks, we need people to shut down banks that are funding this pipeline. There is a front line waiting to be created outside of every Wells Fargo, outside of every Chase bank, and we can all be doing this. So we need to see this as a moment of expansion in this struggle, and not a moment of resolution. KH: Oh, absolutely. Here in Chicago, we have gone after banks a few times now, and a coalition that has formed around doing so involves my group, Lifted Voices, which is a direct action-oriented group, but also largely we do a lot of direct action education. So, folks who are already kind of on that radical tip. We have the American Indian Center, which has been largely a cultural hub and direct services hub in this city, working hand in hand with us, people like the Autonomous Tenants Association. I want a movement, not a clubhouse of people who think they know how it works. I want people to understand that organizing means messing up.

The woman was unarmed and walking away from the officer when he attacked. Will Barton uploaded the video to his Facebook page shortly after the attack occurred. The attack was said to have occurred along the road going into Sacred Stone Camp. Since being uploaded just an hour before this article was released, the video has already received over 25,000 views. The video starts with two water protectors walking down the dirt road with two BIA officers walking up behind them. The officer closest to the two water protectors clearly has his baton out and is walking towards the two in a very aggressive manner. The female water protector appears to be questioning why the agents are coming up behind them when she gets rushed. Barton turns to get away, and we lose sight for a moment, but he turns around in time for us to clearly see the officer with the baton swing on the unarmed water protectors three times. The officer makes two hits to the leg area, then as the camera pulls away again, we can see the officer doing an overhead blow to the woman after she had been hit in the legs. You can hear the female screaming as the officer demands for the wounded female to put her hands behind her back. As she lays on the ground, both officers stand over her before throwing her on her stomach. Three people were said to be arrested during the incident. Bookmark the permalink. 1 Comment.

Water Protectors have been sprayed with water cannons in freezing temperatures, shot with rubber bullets aimed at their heads and genitals, and have had concussion grenades and tear gas lobbed at them. Further, the Army Corps of Engineers has issued an eviction notice for Oceti Sakowin Camp, effective December 5, which leaves the peaceful demonstrators there exposed to further violence through the enforcement of this eviction from their rightful treaty lands. Call the people and agencies listed below to demand that protesters be treated with dignity and respect. Demand that the Dakota Access Pipeline be stopped. I am calling to ask for a de-escalation of the violent tactics being used by law enforcement and that respect be shown for the constitutional rights of those engaging in nonviolent direct actions involving civil disobedience. Please use your influence to pressure the Army Corps to rescind the Dakota Access pipeline permit. Please stand up for citizens of North Dakota and the United States, Native and non-Native, who are entitled to a healthy environment and the assurance that they can assemble, pray, and protect their water without being subjected to violence. I ask that you allow the Water Protectors to remain within the Oceti Sakowin camp on the Cannonball River. The threats to public safety do not stem from the presence of protesters, but rather from the violent methods used by law enforcement to oppose the people who have assembled to protect their water supply and sacred landscapes. While Federal Regulations grant you the power to restrict the usage of Army Corps managed properties, relying on these regulations to close the Oceti Sakowin camp amounts to an escalation of the conflict against peaceful demonstrators, not a de-escalation. The lands in question are within the territory granted the Sioux under the still-valid 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. The Army Corps has failed to properly define the pipeline project area, failed to allow tribes to guide the process of identifying sacred places, and thus failed in its responsibility to adequately consult with the Sioux nation within their own treaty lands. By denying water protectors the first amendment right to peaceful protest, you will be violating their constitutional rights, and by placing liability for harm on the protesters, you will be complicit with the violation of human rights as well. Specific talking points: The Army Corps of Engineers Omaha office issued an eviction notice for the Oceti Sakowin camp late last week, declaring that any water protectors that remain after December 5 would be trespassing and liable for whatever action is taken against them. I demand that you demilitarize your tactics and I remind you that you protect and serve the people of this country, not the corporations. I request that you refrain from mass arrests, macing, clubbing, hooding, strip searching, and armed confrontation with UNARMED, peaceful water protectors engaged in constitutionally protected civil disobedience. I am horrified that you have used water cannons, rubber bullets, tear gas, and concussion grenades on the very citizens you are meant to protect. By perpetrating acts of violence on indigenous people involved in prayer, you are continuing a two-hundred year legacy of the subjugation of Native peoples by the United States. In addition, I want to remind President Obama of the promises he has made to indigenous communities in the United States. The president has the opportunity to secure his legacy by strongly opposing the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and calling for an end to militarized violence against protesters. In recent days the people at Standing Rock have faced violent, militarized actions leaving hundreds wounded. As freezing temperatures set in and violence perpetrated by police worsens the imminent danger only increases for the people at Standing Rock. Note: They will often try to transfer you to the Tribal Justice division. Safariland Group (307) 235-2136 This is the private company that outfits the militarized police force and that has provided many of the weapons used against peaceful protestors. Thousands of people have peaceably assembled in the interests of public safety to protect the water supply for millions of Americans who rely on the Missouri River. Your products are being used against journalists, medical personnel, children, elders, and people engaged in prayer, all of whom are exercising a constitutional right in the common interests of public safety. Many observers have commented that the actions of law enforcement, enabled by your products, may constitute violations of basic human rights. While I recognize that supply and distribution of your products is likely complicated, I request that your company cease to supply law enforcement agencies that are infringing on the rights of citizens in North Dakota. Banks Invested In or Funding the Pipeline There are 17 banks invested in DAPL. They are more susceptible to pressure than the gas and oil companies. Please consider pulling your money from any of these institutions. Furthermore, you can call or email every single one on this list and demand that they stop funding DAPL. I know that this bank is invested in and funding the Dakota Access Pipeline. In the last few days there has been a dramatic increase in violence perpetrated against the peaceful protesters by militarized police. For many months there have been mass arrests, macing, clubbing, hooding, strip searching, armed confrontation with UNARMED peaceful water protectors engaged in constitutionally protected civil disobedience. In the last week, they have used water cannons, rubber bullets, tear gas, and concussion grenades on journalists, media, men and women in prayer, medics and doctors trying to aid those that have been hit, and children. Additional Talking Points Additional Talking Points (if the staff member or assistant that answers the phone asks questions or continues to engage in conversation). DAPL is slated to cross Lakota Treaty Territory at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation where it would be laid underneath the Missouri River, the longest river on the continent. Construction of the DAPL would engender a renewed fracking-frenzy in the Bakken shale region, as well as endanger a source of fresh water for the Standing Rock Sioux and 8 million people living downstream. DAPL would also impact many sites that are sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux and other indigenous nations. At this point, they need to correct the mistake the Army Corps made through inadequate consultation. Tribal Groups decide what is a sacred site, not the government, industry, SHPO, or archaeologists. Water can be a cultural as well as natural resource. Freedom of press has been infringed upon through arrests, prosecution, and targeting of press by law enforcement personnel. Comparison of the treatment of the (Euro-american) occupiers of the Malheur National Wildlife refuge and native protestors at Standing Rock reveals a stark, racialized contrast in the treatment of indigenous peoples by law enforcement.

In response, members of the blamed groups would recoil and defend their consciences by shifting the blame to another group. Blaming someone else does not mean you are blameless. It may seem like a childish question, but my concerns are deeper. Blame is an important moral concept. It references the obligations we have to each other. In terms of the election and democracy generally, questions about blame are linked to the meaning of a vote. We can look to the blame game and extract genuine moral insight. And when we have it, we can improve with respect to our future votes. I want to look forward, not back. But first we all need to recognize where we have failed in our thinking and acting. It is time for honest introspection. I have a straightforward theory to guide our thinking. Blame appears to have two necessary components: causal responsibility and moral fault. In other words, if I blame you for something, it means 1) you had a hand in causing it, and 2) what you caused or how you caused it is morally objectionable. The opposite of blame is praise: you caused something that is good. So praise and blame are both causal and moral concepts. As we saw with blame, causal responsibility and moral condemnation can be shared in varying proportions. If I stole your car, I caused you to be deprived of your property, and I did it contrary to your wishes and in a way that caused you harm. Hence, you (or anyone else) can rightly blame me. If I had an accomplice, you would blame us both. My accomplice and I would share the blame of the single act. In terms of voting, there is not much mystery. Here, yes, the most responsibility belongs to the Trump voters. But we would be mistaken to think that they are the only ones responsible. So we see that race, gender, or age should not be the first divisions to make in the blame game. This is not controversial. But keep in mind that I have yet to make any moral claims. The election was between Clinton and Trump. Trump would not have won had no one voted for him. So if you voted for him, you actively contributed to his win. If you did not vote for his opponent, you passively contributed to his win. (I do not include in my argument people who are victims of voter suppression or voter intimidation. Anti-Clinton progressives are typically far to the left and see Clinton as nowhere near progressive enough to deserve their support. Many social justice activists qualify. This group is quick and content to condemn Trump voters. But if the anti-Clinton progressive voters are right that the Trump voter deserves blame, then, unless they are hypocrites, the moral claim does not depend on the causal component of blame. If culpability were dependent on causality, then both groups would be to blame. So it looks like we have a problem. But I glossed over a distinction. Perhaps the distinction is morally relevant. That is to say, maybe the moral claim does rest on causal responsibility, but the responsibility must be active. This allows the blame to rest wholly on the Trump voter. As a general principle, however, we are left with plenty of room for objections. There are numerous instances (often caught on tape) of people laying injured on the street while strangers pass by without helping. Had the stranger done something at little or no cost to themselves, they would have prevented or improved a bad state of affairs. The strangers simply should have called for help. We all agree. Hence, blame does not always require active causal contribution. I am not claiming that the injured person example is the same as the election. Passive causal responsibility does not always save you from blame. There is no doubt that active contribution to harm is bad. There is also no doubt that active contribution is worse than passive contribution (the person who caused the injuries is more blameworthy than the stranger who simply walks past the injured person). It is difficult to see how. Given my theory of blame, it is a perfectly coherent position. But no, they are not morally at fault. We need both. Therefore, they are not blameworthy. Perhaps a progressive could judge Trump voters for their positions and ideas instead. No doubt, there are plenty of reprehensible views out there. By hypothesis, we need to. It is perfectly plausible, therefore, that there are two distinct moments of blame: the blameworthy ideology and the blameworthy action taken on the basis of that ideology. The hateful people who stay at home all day are not as bad as the hateful people who enact hateful political change. Seems obvious. Hence, even if you can blame Trump voters for something divorced from their causal responsibility in the election, you are free to blame them (and probably do) for their causal responsibility too. So it looks like causal responsibility is back on the moral table. The prospect is rightfully terrifying for millions and millions and millions of people. He has suggested that his candidates must be pro-life, which signals his desire to overturn Roe v. Wade. After all, the man who is on tape bragging about sexual assault is now President of the United States. If Clinton had won, this would not be a concern. Trump said on numerous occasions that he would deport large numbers of illegal immigrants. He knows with certainty that Mexico sends rapists, but he can only assume that some Mexicans are good people. If Clinton had won, mass deportation would not be part of the conversation. The question now becomes whether there is moral fault in passively contributing to his victory. The injured person on the street is an example. Other oppressive regimes in history are examples. When we contemplate how dark and destructive Donald Trump plans to be, perhaps the burden is on the anti-Clinton progressive to justify a non-Clinton vote. Whatever the argument turns out to be, it must explain why voting for the sake of the tens of millions of people who need Obamacare or the tens of millions of immigrants is not the responsibility of everyone (even if your life might not improve). The arguments need to show how a vote for Clinton fundamentally undermines the project of fighting for progressive causes. But that is not the route anti-Clinton progressives usually take. Instead, the response is to claim that a similar list of harms can be constructed for Clinton. The list would include the risk of conflict with Russia and other foreign interventions. Regardless, I want to set that issue aside for a moment. The more pressing issue is why we are comparing lists at all. It illustrates the assumption that it is blameworthy to be partially responsible for putting someone into office who will cause serious harm. If the anti-Clinton progressives were not at fault, then the list of harms would not matter. But they do matter to our moral judgments. Invoking a Clinton list is meant to suggest that either the two candidates are equally bad or Clinton is worse. The attempt to justify the idea that Clinton is just as bad is either a breathtaking display of sanctimony and moral self-conceit or an intellectual failure to consider more than a small number of issues or people. It is also a risky rhetorical move because, if it turns out that Trump represents the greater risk (which, as I humbly aver, was abundantly and unequivocally obvious all along), then the people responsible for putting him into office are deserving of blame. And as we have known all along, that includes anti-Clinton progressives. It therefore assumes that if the two were not equally bad, we should opt for the better option. It also entails that the anti-Clinton progressive links blame to causal responsibility. Third party advocates consistently questioned it, but never with anything remotely compelling. A superficially intimidating sense of moral righteousness has replaced reasoning. The strongest support for the argument is the list of harms. There are obviously some instances in which the argument gives solid guidance. Some situations are so horrendous that we should avoid them, even if that means accepting a less than ideal alternative. We all use that reasoning all the time in our personal lives. That seemed to be the only objection on offer. With the list of harms Trump threatens to unleash, it is worth considering a different perspective. The answer: it is the lesser of two evils. And it is still evil. We are talking about our own actions. There are plenty of complications to my argument, mainly concerning the Electoral College. Consider, however, how frequently the popular vote total is used as a source of hope. It is constantly cited as a way of motivating and inspiring people. Everyone, regardless of state, could have contributed to that hope. But my argument is about morality. I have reminded us that blame can be shared. Some states are more important and some votes more significant. But your vote still mattered, not only as a contribution to the outcome of the election, but also as an expression of your moral judgment. Maybe we should, at times, be willing to sacrifice the appearance of sanctimony. Perhaps that is true altruism and heroism. We need to direct our thinking to future votes. We can no longer allow confident moral posturing to take the place of quality argument. It is time for us to start thinking better and voting better. There is no getting around the fact that a Trump vote was a moral failure. There is no getting around the fact that a Trump vote was a moral failure.

But the negative effects of the persistent lack of access to reproductive health care, to safe maternal care, and to contraception for Native women are just as real. In October 2016, the first baby was born at one of the unified collection of camps set up by Native people with the common goal of protecting the water from the Dakota Access Pipeline. The news was shared online by a group of Indigenous midwives who were at the camp. Zintkala Mahpiya Wi Blackowl gave birth to a baby girl while at the Standing Rock camp. According to Indian Country Today, the decision to have her baby at the water protector camps where people were actively opposing the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) was a conscious one: Having babies is my act of resistance; our reproductive rights as Native women have been taken away from us in so many ways. At one time, we were forcibly sterilized; assimilation has come down really hard on us. In a blog post for Our Bodies Ourselves, Kathryn Krase explains more, In many Native American cultures children are important for tribal survival. Native women have suffered a history of horrific discrimination at the hands of white people, especially when it comes to their reproductive health and rights, including forced sterilization. The weight of trauma carried in the bodies of Native women, passed down through generations, is heavy. And it continues. High rates of poverty and adolescent pregnancy contribute to an environment that does not support their bodily autonomy. For these reasons, access to reproductive health care, including contraception and abortion services, is critical. Unfortunately, IHS is chronically underfunded. American Indians and Alaska Natives who rely solely on IHS for care often lack access to needed care, including preventive care and early treatment of chronic diseases, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Access to over-the-counter contraception has been a struggle. In 2013, two years after emergency contraception became available over-the-counter to most women in the United States and relentless advocacy on the part of reproductive justice organizations, IHS finally mandated its own facilities to provide access to Plan B. Geographic isolation also contributes to challenges in accessing care. The Hyde Amendment, a federal regulation which bars the government from using funds to pay for abortion care except in cases of rape, incest, or if the health of the mother is in danger, means Native American women who depend on IHS for their health care face many barriers to accessing safe and legal abortion care. It is only since Native cultures were colonized by white people that traditional healing practices, particularly those led by women for women, become marginalized. The women and men at Standing Rock put their lives on the line to protect the water and the land from further destruction by a white culture determined, it seems, to wipe out indigenous ways, beliefs, and lives. They succeeded in this hard-fought battle to keep a piece of the earth safe, for now.

Indeed, to attain the desired path for Dakota Access, Energy Transfer Partners was able to take land from reluctant private property owners through eminent domain. However, it was becoming increasingly clear he was punting this issue down the road. Roads, bridges, transmission lines, pipelines, wind farms and water lines will be very difficult, if not impossible, to build when criminal behavior is rewarded this way. In my conversation with Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy today, she was unable to give any legal reasons for the decision and could not answer any questions about rerouting the pipeline. I feel badly for the Corps of Engineers because of the diligent work it did on this project, only to have their Commander-in-Chief throw them under the bus. Others quickly joined the tirade. The pipeline still remains in limbo. For the immediate future, the safety of residents, protesters, law enforcement, and workers remains my top priority as it should for everyone involved. We have seen nothing but foot-dragging and unhelpful directives from the Obama administration.

The Trump administration disagrees. Prominent public health advocates have expressed outrage about these measures. Such censorship is a direct blow at the essence of science: accurately describing the physical world around us. Moreover, these measures will cause many more people to get sick and die. For instance, the homeopathy industry is a multibillion dollar business. While it has been debunked by hundreds of studies, people still want to believe in magical cures. Homeopathy is not harmless, yet despite the fact that it kills people every day, only recently has the federal government taken steps to address this problem. For another example, consider the false claim that vaccines cause autism. This belief is spread widely across the US, and leads to many people failing to vaccinate their children against diseases like measles. While measles was practically eliminated in the US by 2000, in recent years outbreaks of measles have been on the rise in the US, driven by parents failing to vaccinate their children in a number of communities. Simple: People will get sick and die. The diseases and deaths will come from among the most vulnerable. Hundreds of babies have already died due to taking homeopathic medications that were not vetted by the Food and Drug Administration. This year has seen the largest measles outbreak in the US, which mainly impacts children and babies. Many more children and babies will get sick and die as a direct result of the Trump administration's censorship of science. However, these deaths will not be visible, just like the hundreds of thousands of deaths from pollution every year in the US are not visible. Because it is very, very difficult to trace an individual's death to a specific polluter, the polluters get off scot-free with killing thousands of people every year. The Trump administration has already taken many steps that will result in thousands more people dying from pollution every year by rolling back government protections on pollution. Its steps in censoring the science on public health will result in many, many more children, babies and adults getting sick and dying. Yet because it will be incredibly difficult to trace a specific baby's death to the Trump administration's censorship, it will also get off scot-free. However, we can take steps to reverse this and other attacks on science that will cost many people their lives. --- Dr. Gleb Tsipursky is the author of The Truth-Seeker's Handbook: A Science-Based Guide.

Responsible citizenship means listening to your elected leaders and taking what they say seriously. It means examining proposed policy from multiple angles and when your leaders propose things that concern you, you speak up and voice your concerns. It means that when you feel that people will be harmed by a proposed course of action you raise your voice to see if the course of action can be altered or improved to avoid causing as much harm. It means reaching out to your elected representatives and communicating your concerns so they can best represent their constituents. This, you would think, is a fairly non-partisan statement. A statement about civic participation that is as applicable to Republicans under a Democratic President as it is to Democrats under a Republican president. I was stunned, but more I was disappointed. They were canned talking points being hurled with venom at the notion that civic participation in government is important. So, to the person who says we should wait and see, I give you the same challenge I left my student with: I challenge you to be better. I challenge you to engage with political opponents thoughtfully and with nuance rather than canned talking points. I challenge you to engage in cooperative dialogue rather than defiant and oppositional dialogue. To the person who says we should wait and see: No. We should not be passive, we should be active and involved. Not blindly, not dogmatically, but rather as mutual participants with the shared goal of doing right by our citizens, our allies, and our partners around the world.

This multi-state force is only possible by abusing a law meant to aid states in times of natural disaster. It appears that at least some police departments are expecting to get reimbursed by the oil company, which would make them nothing more than mercenaries. Unicorn Riot has obtained emails from the North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which call for an investigation into the money trail enabling the militarized police crackdown at DAPL. I figured I should have some formal form instead of writing hours on a napkin (smiley face). However, an interview with the CEO of Energy Transfer Partners earlier this month raises even more suspicion in light of the emails. All of this calls for further investigation into every penny of funding going into the militarized police crackdown at DAPL, which has inflicted serious injuries on protesters and arrested more than 400 people. As Unicorn Riot notes, the uncovered emails reveal that at least some of the cops indeed view themselves as mercenaries for a private oil company. In the interview, CEO Warren was absolutely sure their pipeline will be completed, even though the Corps of Engineers has delayed granting the easement to build under Lake Oahe. the drinking water source for the Standing Rock Sioux. Despite already losing tens of millions of dollars due to delays caused by the protests, his oil company is willing to give the cops millions more for their services in brutalizing and rounding up protesters.

Here, a story of protection, protest and cultural conflict unfolds against the desolate prairie. At the juncture of the Missouri River and Fort Yates, along the northeastern edge of the Lakota Sioux Standing Rock Reservation, the project slowly churns its way toward a hotly disputed patch of land. Several hundred yards north of the camp, a lone bridge has come to define the front line of this conflict. A concrete barrier topped with barbed wire and decorated with vulgar graffiti exemplifies the air of tension. SPONSORED The stand-off has given way to violence and threats of violence, here and well beyond the borders of the Standing Rock Reservation. While law enforcement and the water protectors engage in a guarded choreography, fear strikes in the vulnerable hamlets that dot the plains. Across the prairie, the pipeline dispute has resurrected age-old enmity between the native peoples and those they perceive to have permanently occupied the territory of native birthright. Normally, by mid-November the ground here would be frozen with knee-deep drifts of Midwest snow. Today, however, the temperature will rise into the mid-60s with almost balmy comfort. His authority is confirmed by the company he keeps with the core leaders of the action. Ken is an imposing figure. Versed in the complex history of Sioux land disputes, Ken explains the intricacies of treaties, land grabsand the exceptions within exceptions that have chipped away at the territory of the Sioux Nation for over 150 years. At best, the state of ownership and land rights is nothing short of confused. The aroma of wood fires and beef stewing in cast iron kettles fills the air. The setting sun casts a shadowy skyline of tents, tepees and converted buses, all gathered to push back at the slow, oncoming creep of the pipeline. The camp ebbs and flows in population, retaining about 6,000 inhabitants, and pushing hundreds of yards to the swampy tributaries flowing into the Missouri. In the process, the excavation will cut through burial grounds. Distrust of the project has intensified over allegations that non-Indian archaeologists from the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Office have been exclusively charged with identifying native graves. On these two issues, there is an odd chorus of consensus bridging what is otherwise a de facto apartheid in this small corner of the world. On and off the reservation, the welfare of the Missouri River provokes ready conversation. Her youthful face softens as her distrust of me thaws. Look at this. On the other hand, the irony of their sensitivity to a distasteful prank, and the simultaneous indifference to the impact on Native American burial grounds, is inescapable. Here, the contempt for Native Americans is palpable and ubiquitous. As much as there is division between races, there is also dissent within. Working on a theme of forgiveness, love and peace, the group prayed for a cleansing of what they claim are the hatred and offenses of both sides of the conflict that occurred in the preceding weeks. Those actions led to the arrest and detention of Lakota Sioux who continued to languish in the Morton County Correctional Center in Mandan. In silence, the demonstrators encircled the jail and courthouse and pleaded for the release of their brethren. It was a display of the diverse beliefs and tactics emerging from the reservation; the hawks and the doves form a division so easily overlooked on the erroneous assumption of a monolithic Lakota Sioux culture and a unified stance in the face of adversity. It is a clean and orderly establishment constructed as a lodge, and decorated with taxidermied wildlife. The place is awash in camos and blaze orange as hunters gather for lunch. I take a seat alongside a regular who eyes me with suspicion. Lori, the barmaid, senses my apprehension and relaxes the atmosphere with some easy talk. I oblige and the conversation soon deepens. Before long, she voices concern about threats to local farmers, the killing of livestock and a plethora of fires and vandalism alleged to have been perpetrated by Indians. According to Lori, the acts are the product of a native reawakening of land rights and a history of intrusion. These and other conversations reveal that, while there is agreement as to issues between those on and off the reservation, opinions are very much in cadence with peer allegiances and along the cultural divide. The dialogue of race is different here. In contrast to the low rumble of urban settings, race-based hatred in rural North Dakota is immediately explosive. The conversations with non-Indians are rife with animus toward Indians and outsiders. Likewise, the indigenous population, on and off the reservation, offers little more warmth. The culture is understandably steeped in historic distrust. Back at the camp, three young people bide their time waiting for a march to the front lines. Today, the Standing Rock Youth Council will take an offering to those manning the SWAT vehicles. They are steadfast in support of the water protection action. Today, they will push to the front lines in peaceful offering to the men bearing arms and armor just beyond the barbed wire. I am confronted by the stoicism of two visiting tribal members from Michigan, and of Maria, a young woman affiliated with several North Dakota tribes. Maria is correct. While tear gas and rubber bullets have been unleashed in the course of the DAPL conflict, the people of Standing Rock show no interest in having their actions seen as being at war with the outside world. I find myself having to fight my way through throngs of posers and protesters to get to the core Native American water protectors who are truly sincere in their actions. Likewise, within the Indian community, as in any community, I discover a great variance of identity and adherence to the mores of Indian culture. I jokingly assure that they will be portrayed in the most stereotypical manner possible. They get the humor. We all get it; the revelation of the Native American as a diverse culture with all of the beauty, humor, internal conflict and struggle for identity as any other. Tension builds as the time to march draws near. Dozens of water protectors assemble across the bridge from the barricade. Members of the SWAT team can be seen readying themselves in the distance. The bridge is disputed territory. Leaders from the Youth Council cradle a sacred pipe and carry an offering of the life-giving water that is threatened by the DAPL. In silence, dozens march on toward the front line. Within yards of the barricade, the council motions for all marchers to be seated. People pray. Some look woefully onward, expecting plumes of tear gas. Cameras click away over the crowd. Among this throng, a young woman carries an infant wrapped in a thick wool blanket. The group is completely vulnerable. I glance over the edge of the bridge and quickly calculate a two-story drop to the freezing water of unknown depth. If things went as they have before, pandemonium could break out with any incoming projectiles. The leaders of the Youth Council disappear behind the burned-out trucks. A number of heavily armored police and military appear from behind the barricade to take stock of the crowd. They peer from behind dark goggles beneath Kevlar helmets, adorned in heavy flak vests, with weapons slung at the ready. The moments linger. Finally, the Youth Council members emerge. They slowly walk to the crowd and command that everyone rise and move forward. In unified mass movement, the marchers close another 10 yards toward the barricade and the tension heightens. The council leaders sternly motion directions and, again, everyone is seated. A murmur spreads across the crowd. His words are slow and punctuated with the tension of the moment. After a long pause, a Lakota woman seated before me raises a rattle in the air and shakes it with a cry of approval. One by one, hands rise and a cheer of praise breaks the quiet. In modest triumph, the marchers make their way back across the bridge in humble silence and with a renewed hope. In the distance, the machines churn on.

This time, instead of fighting for corporate interests, I was fighting for the people. The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), or Bakken Pipeline, is a 1,172-mile oil pipeline project that will transfer crude oil across four states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. From the Bakken fields of North Dakota, the pipeline will carry in excess of 450,000 barrels per day of crude oil to Patoka, Illinois, and possibly on to Texas and near the Gulf Coast areas for refinement or export. I traveled to North Dakota to stand with the people of Standing Rock. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe has called people across this nation and around the world to prayer, action and support for efforts to stop DAPL or, as the people of Standing Rock call it, the Black Snake. They, along with over 300 other Native American tribes, realize that the pipeline will eventually leak and spill oil into their fresh water supply. A spill into the Missouri River would affect 17 million Americans downstream that depend on the river for their drinking water. The people of Standing Rock are not just fighting to save themselves, they are fighting for tens of millions of others. It encompasses struggles against climate catastrophe, a history of breaking treaties with Native Americans, attacks on the right to assemble, assaults on journalists, the militarization of police, and placing corporate profits over human rights. I traveled to Standing Rock with a small group of members from Veterans For Peace (VFP). VFP has had a continued presence at Standing Rock for months now, rotating members in and out. We were also joined by VFP members Ellen Davidson, Sam Adams, Richard Gilchrist, Martin Bates, Michael Sullivan, Ann Wright, and drone whistleblower Cian Westmoreland. The Hulk. While camping at Standing Rock (the official camp name is Oceti Sakowin; Standing Rock is the reservation), we were treated as family. Everyone called each other relatives, brother, sister, mother, grandmother and so on. Water, coffee, food, snacks, tents, clothes and various camping equipment were available to all without a price tag. The only request was for people to be unarmed and drug and alcohol free. There is virtually no cellphone service on the camp. Fellow veteran Matt Hoh and I agreed the camp was a reminder of Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) in Iraq and Afghanistan, without the mortars or rockets blowing up everywhere. After going to a few nonviolent direct action protests against the Black Snake, we realized what it actually meant to stand by the American people and fight in their interests. We suddenly had this feeling of honor, something we never had from our deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan. We know that our own government lied to us. Looking into the eyes of the police at Standing Rock, we saw ourselves. We also know now that not only is water life, as the Standing Rock Sioux continue to cry out, but water is also peace. None of us can have any peace without the basic necessities of life such as clean air and water, arable land, clothing, shelter and justice. The police were blocking peace and obstructing justice on behalf of corporations, greedy bankers and investors. They arrested the people and protected the construction equipment. We saw journalists being attacked and warrants issued for their arrests just for holding a microphone and interviewing people. We saw police forces using military-grade equipment that Matt and I used in combat zones overseas. We saw the infringement of constitutional rights such as the right to assemble. But most important, we saw Native Americans courageously continue to defend their land and people from a genocidal 500-year war against the state and corporations alike. The Sioux and the hundreds of other tribes and supporters are joining forces to fight for their right to exist. This struggle is their life, and has been for too many generations to count. At one time I thought the government, the military and police knew what they are doing and that they existed to protect us all. That myth has been shattered.

(photo: COUNTERCURRENTNEWS) War Has Broken Out in North Dakota By Marc Ash, Reader Supported News 23 November 16 he situation in North Dakota at the site of the Dakota Access Pipeline has degenerated into what can now only fairly be described as a war zone. The escalating assaults on unarmed protesters by heavily armed, fully militarized police units have transformed the Dakota Access Pipeline construction site into a battlefield. Scores of people have been injured and medics are struggling to evacuate the injured to area medical facilities for treatment. The scene is one of constant clashes and assaults by North Dakota military police attempting to drive Native American protesters away from the pipeline construction site. Using military tactics, law enforcement unleashed barrage after barrage of military grade tear gas, rubber bullets, water sprayed from high-pressure hoses in below freezing temperatures, and concussion grenades. The worst injury reported occurred as a result of a concussion grenade thrown by police directly striking a 21-year-old protester from New York. Sophia Wilansky suffered severe damage to her arm when the grenade detonated in close proximity. The injury caused a compound fracture and extensive damage to muscle, nerve and bone, resulting certainly in a lifelong disability. Details of the Wilansky incident have gone viral on Twitter. With hostilities and injuries mounting, President Obama is taking a disturbingly hands-off approach. They are here, and the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation is the first great battlefield.

Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome. This is the response of the most powerful corporate juggernaut in history. But right in the tradition of the Ludlow massacre. I only hope his daughters never fully understand the depth of his betrayal to all of us. These are the bravest of the brave who are fighting against a monster that destroys without care or compassion, who have no regard for the rule of law and have abandon all morality. Human rights and our lives are being trampled on for profits and we should expect much more abuse of our rights and liberties in the years to come as we are taken down the road to extinction for the short -term benefit of a few. The water protectors are peaceful, they are praying and communing together to protect the resource, water especially that belong to everyone, the goons attacking them as well.

Yes, he's a coward, like all global imperialists and corporate-fasci sts are, but he's not a wimp when it comes to doing their bidding. It would be interesting to know more fully the nature and methods of exerting control over him. For some reason I still believe he knows this pipeline is the wrong thing to do.

I'm not necessarily saying it was exactly like in the book and the movie(s), but he has been completely brainwashed. Then he was groomed, prepared and installed in the presidency. He was completely cowed a very long time ago. I hesitate to say what may have also been systematically done to him in order to completely brainwash him, but it is not far-fetched or unlikely at all, though I don't dare express it here. Wake up completely and get totally knowledgeable about what's really going on and who's behind it; that, again, you should already know so you wouldn't feel the need to ask me such willfully-inept questions. You don't seem to realize that unfortunately enforcers of the law work for the Fascist Plutocrats that are soon to rule our nation. You don't seem to realize that unfortunately enforcers of the law work for the Fascist Plutocrats that are soon to rule our nation. Yes, but members of law enforcement are individual people who go home after work. A blown up car here, a burnt out shed there. Money can't buy happiness and it sure can't buy safety for the little minions either. It has arrived in our country, where it began very probably as an invasion right after WWII with Paperclip. It has been setting up shop. Like any aggressive cancer, it spread to the most vulnerable areas of the world-wide ecosystem first. We are now seeing in our own country, starting where the people and ecosystems are most vulnerable, what horror it has perpetrated in other resource rich countries such as Ecuador, Brazil, the Congo, Indonesia (a list which would use up all the symbols left). This fascist cartel skillfully uses all the techniques of popular uprising massacre. PLUS murder. It would not surprise me in the least that, as in the Amazon regions, leaders of the eco-revolution in our own country are quietly, in the night, assassinated. If you still do not believe me, look at the men being given positions of power around a charismatic leader put in place by a small, deluded minority of our citizenry. Sounds almost like.... the Nazis. No, it didn't. Weirdly, it seems to me that in my daily social encounters, it is the Rush Limbaugh listeners who are most likely to admit the frightening depth of corruption in our country, despite the deeply odious, racist, bigotry spouted by that particular oaf. get everything they want, and everybody else gets screwed. If they protest violence is inflicted on them. She would really have helped these good people. She would really have helped these good people. She would really have helped these good people. You're being facetious, I presume. We have a legal system in this country. If they want to stop this they need get those who signed the right-of-way agreements to recind their approval. This is a doable legal step that truly would stop the pipeline. Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, & this one really needs saucing. It could have been somebody else, but you really need to stay in more, and read significant stuff. It's kind of a sore spot with them, y'see. What a system of communication this wonderful (more sarcasm) technology affords us. Just one more genocidal police state action among 1000s waged against Native Americans, Native Peoples worldwide really when including all of Central and South America, Africa and Asia. Genocide is the name of Obama's game. That is his legacy. The munitions multiply, but the psychopathology remains. That will change unless the aggressors stop. As a believer in reasonable gun control restrictions, I feel almost ashamed that I am glad there are millions of guns and billions of rounds in the hands of ordinary Americans. It is frightening and sad but crazy people with guns will be drawn to this conflict like moths to a flame, whether in ND or their own home towns. And I'm ashamed that I harbor hope things will escalate to the point where there will be no turning back - us against them. We don't have the fire power, many on this website have moaned. Well consider this. An ant is very small compared to a human being. It's a massacre. Hiding behind Michele's skirt. Probably trying to protect his daughters. Jordan Chariton of TYT Politics has been covering this in a way that much of the MSM has not. Likewise those murdered by the USian Empire at Wounded Knee...or at Kent State University and Jackson State College. I've just always thought of the killing of many unarmed people who can't or won't defend themselves as a massacre. Going to take you a lot more of these kind of commentaries to repair your and RSN's damaged credibility. The oil wars are not 'over there' any longer. Ash; very well said indeed. About which five points: (1)-This -- the violent and ultimately murderous suppression of dissent -- is precisely the purpose for which the USian local police were federalized and militarized into a new Gestapo. (2)-The grenade that nearly killed Sophia Wilansky was obviously a military grenade (not a crowd-control grenade) or it would not have inflicted the wound it did. (3)- Ms. Wilansky would have died were she not given immediate aid by water-protector medics. In other words, the neo-Gestapo is already using lethal ammunition against the water protectors. (4)-The horrors are just beginning. Mass murder -- including by air-strikes and artillery -- is not inconceivable. (5))-Again too many on the Left are using the wrong invective. He is a white-hearted closet Nazi in blackface whose primary assignment was to clear the way -- by nullifying the Bill of Rights -- for a publicly-avowed Nazi to become emperor, and precisely because of his monstrous, morally imbecilic intellect, he has succeeded beyond his One Percent masters' fondest dreams. But it's not surprising at all. As the U.S., the West and the world become more of the oppressive and repressive totalitarian militarized corporate-fasci st state that they are rapidly being transformed into, we are going to see more and more of this kind of thing. It is all being done intentionally. Everyone who resists the global corporate-fasci st totalitarian militarized police state will be destroyed, or indefinitely imprisoned for the rest of their lives. As far as the powers-that-be (PTB) are concerned, we will all be subjugated, and not raise any fuss against it whatsoever, or we will be imprisoned or destroyed. That is the message we are being sent by the PTB with these precursors to the far worse that is coming down the pike if we don't totally submit and accept our complete enslavement under absolute domination and control, with no True Freedom and Liberty existent anymore at all. They don't leave room for anything else. The PTB want us all willing, and completely cowed, slaves who don't dissent in any way, or we will be crushed. It is not about saving humanity and the planet, but about subjugating and enslaving us all, and eventually exteriminating most of humankind. That is why it is all that much more important to not surrender to or bow down to this eradication of all of our True Liberty and Freedom in any way(s) whatsoever, and to stand up against it no matter what. The only other alternative to standing up against this madness, is surrendering to and bowing down to it; but that is NOT an option. We have got to at least try to put a stop to this insanity, even if we have to die doing so, because the alternative is not acceptable in any way, shape, form or fashion at all. So, be courageous people, don't be cowards, and please stand up against all of this global(ist) totalitarian corporate-fasci st enslavement with all your non- violent might, and don't at all give up or give in, come what may, for all of our sakes. Maybe full on (un)Civil war within 5 - 10 yrs. Hell, they already do. It won't. Because the majority was needed to rise up to truly be successful. It's not all these peoples' fault. They've been turned into spineless cowards who rationalize everything that is the opposite of doing what is truly right, heroic and courageous. The powers-that-be have been much too successful at counter- acting and neutralizing the people, all by their design and implementation of multitudinous means, none of which are any accident, but were all systematically instituted for our detriment. In the past I have been rudely assailed at RSN for mentioning this. But in the spirit of trying to break through the silence, take the risk again. Heck, they won't even entertain the FACT that fluoride was used in the Jewish ghettos and the concentration camps to keep the people docile and passive, so they in most cases wouldn't fight back, and would, relatively peacefully, go to their internment and deaths, as they did, with little or no dissent. Thus, they of course also won't entertain the FACT that it is absolutely no accident that all across the U.S. and the Western world, and then some, the public water supplies consumed and bathed in by the vast majority of the population, are filled with fluoride. So, it is also absolutely no accident that the powers-that-be want to force us all to be vaccinated, in violation of informed-consen t, with vaccines full of immune-destroyi ng live viruses and preservatives (and, even if the mercury was removed, which I'm not convinced of, there are several other immune-destroyi ng preservatives that are put in the vaccines). Then, you add to that most of the pesticides, etc., that are in all of our foods, and it is very clear that we are being systematically, and intentionally, poisoned at every turn, to lower our immunity and make us much more prone to disease(s), and to cause us to develop cancer(s). One thing that impedes arrival at consensus here is the combining of various ideas into a min-manufesto. For example, Loren-bliss's 5-point offering above: four of five points seem worthy. So my support for 1-4 goes unvoted. Happens a lot with combination posts. Just a thought: maybe we could make more progress in our discussion by untangling our messaging. Coming up, blacks who acted like him were called Oreos. But Obama's legacy is far worse than any of those blacks who simply seek white acceptance by adapting their racist memes. He has in fact taken away all of our rights to habeas corpus, provided more of the military weapons and equipment to police than any Presidents since Bill Clinton signed the 1033 Program, dramatically increased offshore oil drilling and onshore fracking for methane. And of course, he's been bombing 7 or 8 countries, murdering untold numbers of non-whites. In other words white nazis are less bad than black nazis. That appears racist to me. To be sure, many of obama's actions, and many US actions he has presided over have been severely disappointing. Because of being at odds with his campaign and other promises. But to the extent that particular expectations for his behavior in office were based on his race, that is the definition of racism. Well, he's an Uncle Tom, too; the same thing as calling him the Oreo cookie that he is. Falling for same is to falsely believe and respond the way(s) that the puppetmasters, false-propagand ists and controllers of the masses want us to believe and respond. It feeds right into their hands, and their manipulations and brainwashing of us. But, on the contrary, we ARE supposed to freely express, and allow, such speech. Apropos political correctness, obviously you who damn me as a racist are too simple minded to understand it is one of the most effective Ruling Class weapons to obscure the reality of -- and necessity for -- class struggle. Moreover, identity politics is the most effective barrier to Working Class solidarity our capitalist (i.e., Nazi) overlords have yet devised. (By the way, this alleged racist you so maliciously denounce went to jail -- and by so doing sacrificed an extremely promising journalism career for the Civil Rights Movement. This was in Knoxville, Tenn., on 2 June 1963. Hence to be insulted and condemned by the likes of you -- or by any zealot whose identity-politi cs fanaticism is one of the enablers of Nazism (and is thus in fact a collaborator with Nazism) -- is not something to which I will silently submit. Campaigning as Obama the Orator, he shape-shifted into Barack the Betrayer literally days after his election. Moreover, the manner in which he transformed proved it was planned years before the 2008 election: that he was raised a moral imbecile and thereafter carefully schooled in the deceptions essential for false-flag candidacy. His legacy -- especially after our new Nazi overlords finish propagandizing it -- will be the destruction, forever, of all African-America n political aspirations. Not only is the Betrayer therefore an archetypal Uncle Tom, an exemplary Oreo, he is a traitor to his race -- and given the ecocidal capitalist malignancy of his Nazi deceptiveness, he is therefore a traitor to our entire species. Indeed, if there is any one person to be blamed for the fact that on 20 January we officially become a Nazi nation, it is Obama -- the Betrayer who made sure Trump would take office with all the powers formerly held by Adolf Hitler. In this context the color of Obama's skin is pivotal -- precisely because it was the main prop he used to leverage his colossal deceptions. I don't recall ever hearing a white use the term. Yes, for a member of an oppressed minority to deliberately do harm to other members of oppressed minorities can certainly be seen as worse. White males may be clueless. Not that that's an excuse, but I know a lot of clueless people. Similarly, gay legislators who pass laws that discriminate against LGBTQ individuals can be seen as worse. Women who vote to take away other women's right to choose can be seen as worse. They all should know better, and likely do. That's how completely right-on it is. I've avoided replying to your comments since that tiff, but have continued to up vote them as I continue to find almost all of them right on. Cheers back atcha. I'm something of a wordsmith, so I looked it up. If that was not your complaint, you might want to repost as a direct reply to the offender. There have been a lot of people taking a lot of offense to a lot of posts for a lot of weeks due to misunderstandin gs. Errors in communication are unavoidable, but exactly as you suggest, we cannot afford to alienate the people with whom we must collaborate most directly before we can make common cause with people with whom we have much more serious disagreements. Our Prime Minister John Key was sent here by the bankers to turn this country into a third world country which he has done. The people here have no input at all and have trade agreements forced upon us against our wishes. Police have been militarized and working for the National government. Clearly these fascist dictators are all over world doing their jobs of destroying nations, putting the people into debt from childhood, therefore enslaving them to their countries. Capitalism is rampant here with the people pushed to the wall, thrown out of their state houses to be sold. With such low wages many cannot afford to buy food so families live in poverty, going hungry. Homelessness is rife throughout the country now. National has flooded the country with a hundred thousand immigrants a year, many with no job skills, and undercutting our wages. They can become citizens very quickly so will then be able to vote and keep the National Party in power. All has been well planned by using hegemony to keep the people in line. Many kiwis now cannot be bothered voting which is having a terrible effect on elections. Throughout the world people are all suffering and what the Dakota Indians are going through is a travesty against humanity. Many of us are with you and you do not stand alone. Most people who get into politics sell out today, if it wasn't always the case. It's all part of the globalist corporate-fasci st plans to subjugate and enslave the entire West, and then the entire world. Hence what a huge irony if China, in its quest for economic independence, becomes the savior of human liberty. And many if not most of the packages from there are probably radioactive from being x-rayed going through customs, so we're probably going to get cancer(s) from handling the packages and products. No, China isn't going to save us from nothin'. The terrain is made for long range rifles and unless actual armored helicopter gunships are used regular helicopters are also in danger. The National Guard has the helicopters. So, we may find out if the American Military will shoot rebelling American Citizens on American soil.

The event was planned by members of the International Indigenous Youth Council and others protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline and its planned path alongside the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and its water supply. Another organizer of the giveaway was Native Hawaiian Andre Perez, who has become a prominent figure in the pipeline protest. Other items included paper plates, batteries, energy drinks and cold weather headgear. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said earlier this week that his department would begin fining people for delivering provisions to the Oceti Sakowin Camp where thousands of protesters have congregated. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has said the camp must be vacated by Monday. Demonstrators traveled more than hour from their camp next to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation to deliver supplies to the police who have been arresting them. He told reporters and photographers that the demonstrators, who call themselves water protectors, would not be providing the officers with energy drinks and sodas. In fact, Perez was greeted by an officer dressed in riot gear, including a helmet with a plastic face guard. Sign up for our FREE morning newsletter and face each day more informed. Sign Up Sorry.

Huckabee Sanders denied that Trump was breaking his campaign promise to protect the LGBTQ community. Unusually, the new press secretary threatened to end the briefing if questions on the topic continued. The next question was about cabinet morale, but then a reporter returned to the issue of transgender people in the military. The briefing ended two minutes later. There are already transgender individuals who are serving capably and honorably. Several studies had already found that reversing the ban was unlikely to have a negative impact on the military. A 2016 study by the Rand Corporation estimated there are up to 6,630 trans people on active duty and up to 4,160 in the select reserve. There are roughly 1.4 million active-duty US service members. The delay was negotiated after the chiefs of the army, navy, air force and marine corps requested more time to prepare for the recruitment of transgender service members. Reports have suggested the joint chiefs asked for an additional six months, while others wanted another two years. But there was no public indication that the joint chiefs were seeking an outright ban. As a candidate, Trump cast himself as a supporter of LGBT rights and indicated he would uphold certain Obama-era policies designed to protect transgender people. Illinois senator Tammy Duckworth, who lost both her legs on duty in Iraq, also chastised Trump. Earlier this month, the House of Representatives voted down a measure that would have restricted funding for trans members of the military. Although the measure passed a House committee on a party line vote, it failed on the House floor on a 209-214 vote.

You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. The standoff to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a fever pitch, and this may be our last chance to halt construction before Donald Trump takes office. Militarized law enforcement and private security firms are harassing, assaulting and jailing hundreds of non-violent protesters who are fighting for indigenous rights and to curb climate change. They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline.

People come from all over, and this movement has taken on a life of its own. When you focus on water, it's easy for other interests to come and join in because it is concerning the environment, making sure the environment is protected. As this grows and it gets bigger and bigger, and as it evolves, the interest isn't really for water anymore. It's more about a conflict between law enforcement and the water protectors and trying to hold ground or trying to advance and that's not what this is about. We're doing everything we can to try to stop this from happening and I don't have any guarantees that it will. But we're putting the best effort forward. All the other issues, all the other distractions, don't help. Because it's forever evolving now. There's no way that we can keep everybody focused on the same thing. It's all about being prayerful and peaceful. It's not about a confrontation. We started this to protect our water. We were told by our youth, by our elders, and by the spirits that if you fight this with prayer and peace you will defeat it. But if you use violence, natural law's going to take over and it's going to go underneath this river, and it's going to threaten the water. And we don't always know what is going to happen when they reach that front line. The law enforcement has militarized themselves and they put people at risk, they put lives at risk. If we do, we're definitely not going to win. We don't have weapons, we don't have a military. They don't need to be here if they're not willing to stand down and let the Creator do his work. The more violence we create, the more it hurts our cause in fighting this pipeline. We're trying to stop this pipeline. We've been doing really good. If you think about it, this pipeline should have been done. But the work that we've set forth and we continue to do, gives us hope. There's a little bit of hope. But people don't know that, people don't understand that. They think that the camp is the reason why. That's not the reason why. We've been working hard at this for two years. It's not just the last 100 days. They'll say that this is the least impactful route, that's why they chose this route. Whether it's the least impactful or not there's still tribal lands and tribal interest. They knew that we were opposed to this pipeline from the onset. But they were still going to push it through no matter what. When they had alternative routes north of Bismarck they still choose this route. In 1851, we had a treaty. We identified lands that were important to us and that had sacred places to us. So they took more land. And then in 1877, there was gold discovered in the Black Hills. Gold was used for national security, to back our currency in the United States. Each time these things happen, it creates trauma for the people. That's because of all of the wrongs. National security, economic development, energy independence. Three things in the history (that) were used so this great nation was built off of our backs. It continues to encroach on our rights and our people. What little we have left is this water. The little land that we have left is still there. So we should have a say, we should have a right to it.

That's a sacred place. But there's no regard. It's about instant gratification. Before this entire movement started, that was some of the most beautiful land around. There was a place down there where eagles, over 100 eagles would come and land. Now, it's occupied by people. And when masses of people come to one place, we don't take care of it. I heard that they're digging pits down there for their human waste. That's a flood zone. So when the floodwaters come up, that waste is going to be contaminating the water. We're no different than the oil company, if we're fighting for water. It's going to be us, the people who live here. Not only that, but there are relationships that are being damaged because of unlawful actions, violent actions, violent behavior against law enforcement. Law enforcement lives here. And we live here.

That's a sacred place. But there's no regard. It's about instant gratification. Before this entire movement started, that was some of the most beautiful land around. There was a place down there where eagles, over 100 eagles would come and land. Now, it's occupied by people. And when masses of people come to one place, we don't take care of it.

Archambault II in August. It wasn't me individually or the tribe. Something that we believe is necessary for all life, and we definitely don't want it to be threatened. So when you stand up for something that simple, that basic, it's easy for people to join in. People come from all over, and this movement has taken on a life of its own. When you focus on water, it's easy for other interests to come and join in because it is concerning the environment, making sure the environment is protected. As this grows and it gets bigger and bigger, and as it evolves, the interest isn't really for water anymore. It's more about a conflict between law enforcement and the water protectors and trying to hold ground or trying to advance and that's not what this is about. We're doing everything we can to try to stop this from happening and I don't have any guarantees that it will. But we're putting the best effort forward. All the other issues, all the other distractions, don't help. Because it's forever evolving now. There's no way that we can keep everybody focused on the same thing. It's all about being prayerful and peaceful. It's not about a confrontation. We started this to protect our water. We were told by our youth, by our elders, and by the spirits that if you fight this with prayer and peace you will defeat it. But if you use violence, natural law's going to take over and it's going to go underneath this river, and it's going to threaten the water. And we don't always know what is going to happen when they reach that front line. The law enforcement has militarized themselves and they put people at risk, they put lives at risk. If we do, we're definitely not going to win. We don't have weapons, we don't have a military. They don't need to be here if they're not willing to stand down and let the Creator do his work. The more violence we create, the more it hurts our cause in fighting this pipeline. We're trying to stop this pipeline. We've been doing really good. If you think about it, this pipeline should have been done. But the work that we've set forth and we continue to do, gives us hope. There's a little bit of hope. But people don't know that, people don't understand that. They think that the camp is the reason why. That's not the reason why. We've been working hard at this for two years. It's not just the last 100 days. They'll say that this is the least impactful route, that's why they chose this route. Whether it's the least impactful or not there's still tribal lands and tribal interest. They knew that we were opposed to this pipeline from the onset. But they were still going to push it through no matter what. When they had alternative routes north of Bismarck they still choose this route. In 1851, we had a treaty. We identified lands that were important to us and that had sacred places to us. So they took more land. And then in 1877, there was gold discovered in the Black Hills. Gold was used for national security, to back our currency in the United States. Each time these things happen, it creates trauma for the people. That's because of all of the wrongs. National security, economic development, energy independence. Three things in the history (that) were used so this great nation was built off of our backs. It continues to encroach on our rights and our people. What little we have left is this water. The little land that we have left is still there. So we should have a say, we should have a right to it. Whenever that's the excuse, economic development, energy independence, national security, then do it somewhere else. Stop doing it to us. We're saying, don't do it again.

We've had experts on pipelines weigh in and say this is not the safest thing to do, when we look at all the pipeline breaks across this country. What I am asking them to do is to reroute, to move the pipeline away from here. They'll say that this is the least impactful route, that's why they chose this route. Whether it's the least impactful or not there's still tribal lands and tribal interest. They knew that we were opposed to this pipeline from the onset.

In rural North Dakota, thousands of Native American water protectors and their non-native supporters are standing against state violence and corporate greed to defend their land and their water. There were more than five thousand people in the main encampment there as of yesterday, and perhaps more on the way. And thus the decision by the Morton County police to use water cannons against 400 men and women was especially vicious. They used pepper spray and flash grenades, and hundreds of people were injured. One young woman may lose her arm. To Energy Transfer Partners, a Fortune 500 corporation, the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline is worth any amount of pain it needs to inflict. The pipeline, if completed, will carry half a million barrels of crude oil daily. The pipeline was moved from its original path near Bismarck due to community opposition there, and in what surprises precisely no one, the new route now runs very close to the Standing Rock reservation and threatens the Missouri River. History has a way of repeating itself, and the US government breaking its word to native people, and destroying their land for profit, is nothing new. We can write a new story. The first Thanksgiving, as the legend goes, was a meal shared by Native Americans and British colonists in harmony. At that time, the Reservation covered a huge chunk of what is now South Dakota. This was just five years after President Lincoln established Thanksgiving as a National Holiday in 1863. The US broke that treaty fast, starting when General Custer found gold in 1874. In 1890, the US government violated a different treaty and broke the land into five smaller reservations. Pressure from settlers moving west was too much to allow such treaties to stand. It became a familiar process. Land slowly (or quickly) taken away. Always under color of law, but with almost no regard for justice. The fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline is another chapter in this sorry history. Science is clear. We must radically reduce the level of carbon extraction to avert catastrophic global climate change. And for that, we owe the water protectors at Standing Rock our greatest thanks on this Thanksgiving Day. This is the right and essential thing to do.

While most of America will be sitting around the dinner table and carving a turkey tonight, the natives of this land, the people who were here first, are currently putting their lives in danger and having to fight to keep what is rightfully theirs in South Dakota. If you have not heard about the controversy around the Dakota Access pipeline, here is a quick overview of what is happening: a Texas based company, Energy Transfer Partners, wants to build a pipeline through the Dakotas so that they will be able to transport crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. Big ones. For starters, it is a risky venture. Pipelines can burst very easily, and if this one were to burst, it would be a disaster in the Missouri River; animals would die, and the water would be destroyed. On top of this, the placement of this pipeline is directly correlated with the water sources that go to the Native American reservations nearby, and it is highly likely that it will get contaminated and put many at risk of health-issues. On top of that, the land that they want to build this pipeline on is ancient Native American burial ground. It is considered sacred land, and is very important to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe that resides nearby. Thousands of people, both people of the tribe as well as others, have been protesting at Standing Rock; they have been facing terrible weather, bad living conditions and are constantly at risk of being attacked by officials who have been accused of treating the peaceful protestors terribly. While this issue has been going on for a while now, it is only now finally getting some media attention; it has been largely covered up, and that is not alright because so many of the people in this nation have absolutely no idea that this is going on. Be thankful for what you have today, but do what you can to try and help others out too. The first step is educating yourself on what is happening at Standing Rock, but there are so many ways, after that, to make a difference in this situation.

This is disappointing news, but it is not surprising, for Donald Trump is no friend to American Indians, and it looks like his presidency is going to stand in stark contrast to that of his predecessor, in this as in so many other ways. Some have expressed the fear that he will bring back the Termination era. He worked with Congress to secure significant increases in funding for the Indian Health Service. And when President Obama signed legislation reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, it included a new provision allowing tribes to arrest and prosecute non-Indians who committed acts of domestic violence against Native American women, a major problem when courts had held in the past that tribal governments lacked the power to prosecute non-Indians on reservations. And that I am not optimistic really bums me out, because there are a hell of a lot of problems out there that sane political leaders from our two major parties might be able to solve. Our Creon has said nothing about Indian affairs. He could fulfill a campaign promise and aid Native nations by pushing through Congress a program to repair and replace roads, bridges, and dams on Indian reservations. Senators and representatives from states with large Native American populations have urged caution in repealing the Affordable Care Act, noting that the progress made in reducing the still gaping health disparities between Native Americans and non-natives were indeed significant and much work remains to be done. But the initiative certainly will not come from the Executive Branch. Poverty and a lack of opportunity in Indian Country remain vexing challenges to policy makers and tribal leaders alike. The Obama presidency had some significant accomplishments in Indian affairs. Be glad you were given land to live on instead of wiping your kind out entirely as so many other empires have done to conquered people in years past. Your continued existence is entirely by our good will. Do not test out patience. But the larger point is that comments like yours, so angry, violent and racist, are what native peoples have faced for hundreds of years. And it is why I write. All of us must stand up forcefully to racist dingbats like yourself. I am more than happy to test your patience, Chuck. I hope you respond to this. I would encourage you to read my book before you do, and, perhaps, to read the United States Constitution and some of the 370 treaties native peoples have negotiated with the United States.

The gravest injuries were a tribal elder who suffered a cardiac arrest, and Sophia Wolansky, a 21-year-old New York City resident who had come to back the Standing Rock Sioux in their struggle to halt construction of the pipeline. She has been evacuated to a hospital in Minneapolis where physicians and nurses are fighting to save her arm and hand from an amputation. She's peacefully trying to get people to not destroy the water supply. The grenade wound (left image) suffered by Sophia Wolansky (right) blew away the muscle, exposing bone, looking like a war injury, not the typical police-abuse type injury. The attack on Sunday night, which has been rightly condemned by UN human rights observers as an atrocity, harks back to the simultaneous country-wide crushing of the Occupy movement occupations in cities across the US during early November, 2011, when local police aided in some cases by armed federal parks police, assaulted occupiers with maximum violence, almost always at night, barring the media from witnessing their deliberate and coordinated over-the-top violence. In that case, an aggressive campaign of legal discovery by the Partnership for Civil Justice using the Freedom of Information Act, resulted in the unearthing of documents from both the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI proving there had been a concerted campaign by those federal agencies to coordinate the crushing of the Occupy Movement. It would appear that the repressive lessons learned by police agencies in 2011 are now being used as a kind of repression handbook by Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier and his deputies against the protesting Sioux water protectors and their Anglo supporters. There is no indication that such vicious repression is working though. Even as the brutal assault last Sunday night and Monday morning sent dozens of people to area hospitals, more brave people continued to pour into Standing Rock to support the struggle of the Standing Rock Sioux and the many representatives of some 300 US tribes around the country, and the representatives of indigenous peoples from around the world fighting this battle. There, protests by the local (white, middle-class) public forced a rethink by the companies behind the pipeline, and the US Army Corps of Engineers. They decided to alter the planned route to run it through Indian territory instead. The Standing Rock Tribal Council has called on President Obama to put a halt to this dangerous and obscene project, suggesting that as president he has the power to declare the crossing location a National Historic Site, thus protecting it from such defilement. In 2014, President Obama visited the Standing Rock Sioux, and acknowledged their centuries of abuse by the US government. Contact the White House at 202-456-1414 and demand that the president send troops to stand between Sioux water protectors and their local law-enforcement assailants, and to have Federal Marshals arrest those who commit acts of brutality. What the government will do to Native Americans and their Anglo supporters today is what we can probably expect them to do to any of us who protest in this new Trumpian America.

You failed to do your job when you approved two tar sands pipelines that will put rivers and coasts at risk and that will undeniably lead to much more of the devastating climate-change effects that we are already feeling and that will one day soon wipe out our cultures and all of life on earth. Story continues below advertisement Opinion: From Alberta to Standing Rock, indigenous peoples must be consulted Gary Mason: Trans Mountain pipeline approval was crucial to Notley's political survival Gary Mason: Trans Mountain pipeline continues to be juicy fodder for attack ads in B.C. You also failed in your sacred duty to respect the Title and Rights of the indigenous peoples that you share this land with. You knew you would irreparably harm a relationship that you publicly and repeatedly claimed is more important to you than any other. You also must have known that allowing two pipelines to carry over a million barrels a day of additional tar sands production is not the way we are going to solve the climate crisis. No one could truly believe that more oil will help us get off oil. It's too ludicrous to even contemplate. You cannot truly believe that the Kinder Morgan sevenfold increase in tanker traffic is not a real risk to the B.C. coast, to everything that Coast Salish Peoples hold dear, including the fishing and tourism industries, to the orcas, shell-fish harvesting and the dynamic life systems in the ocean and on land. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement Not after we just saw a major accident mere weeks ago further up the B.C. coast which devastated the Heiltsuk Nation and could have proven unimaginably catastrophic if the barge that the tugboat was attached to had been carrying oil. Do not tell me that this is about jobs and the economy. We have seen that the oil industry is a roller-coaster ride and the ride will soon come to a full stop in any event. That is not a recipe for jobs and a sustainable economy for Alberta. I believe that as a young leader you felt you had played nice for long enough and had enough political clout, both nationally and internationally, to be able to take the gloves off, make an extremely unpopular decision that will secure you political favour with dirty oil supporters and get away with it. Thankfully, we as indigenous peoples do not have to play those games. We are stewards of Mother Earth and must make sure she is safe and can take care of, and provide for, our children and future generations. You can count on us to do our job, Prime Minister. We will not let our people down. And what gives me hope is that we are not alone. While leaders around the world are failing their people and not doing their job, the people are picking up the slack. In just beyond a week, more than 10,000 Coastal Protectors have signed up at coastprotectors.ca to do what needs to be done to stop Kinder Morgan. The Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion now counts well beyond 100 First Nations and tribes from all across the continent who have joined together to stop both Kinder Morgan, Enbridge Line 3 and any other tar sands pipeline that rears its ugly serpent head, including Keystone XL and Energy East. Story continues below advertisement And when push comes to shove in the near future, when battle lines are drawn over the construction of these pipelines, I still like to hope that you will relent, that you will see the error of your ways and that you will not allow the same kind of ugly, hateful and violent reaction to the peaceful prayers of our brothers and sisters at the Standing Rock camps. So we will go do our job, Prime Minister. The job you could not do. All we ask is that you let us go do it in peace. This is a space where subscribers can engage with each other and Globe staff.

George Kipp III (D-Heart Butte) introduces HB486 Monday afternoon, which aims to prohibit pipelines from crossing under navigable waters. Buy Now Gary Forrester of WBI Energy testifies against HB486 Monday afternoon. The measure would ban pipelines with a diameter of 10 inches or greater from going under navigable water bodies and establish construction requirements for them to cross above ground, including rules on casings and leak detection. The new regulations would apply to fossil fuels such as crude petroleum, coal and their products. And it comes as the nation debates the best methods to transport crude oil, what risk to water sources is acceptable, and how far tribal sovereignty extends when projects cross aboriginal lands that are no longer tribally owned, as was the case outside Standing Rock where thousands have gathered for months to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline. The decision by President Donald Trump in January to revive the Keystone XL pipeline project with a handful of executive actions drew a mixed response. As proposed, 284 miles of the 1,700-mile project would cut through Montana, crossing the Canadian border north of Malta and passing into South Dakota north of Ekalaka. Federal rules require pipelines to be at least four feet deeper than water bodies, but opponents of the bill said Monday most are now dug 20 to 60 feet deep, depending on geographic features. Rep. George Kipp III said the bill, which he introduced, is as much about protecting underground aquifers from contamination as it is about rivers and streams. It has since been replaced at a new depth of 20 feet. The committee took no action on the bill Monday. Click any reaction to login.

If you've never peacefully protested before, it's not scary. You'll find it to be an exhilarating experience. Besides receiving positive feedback from motorists and pedestrians, we also were interviewed by local radio and newspaper reporters.

Matthews We can't stand still for the atrocities happening at Standing Rock. It is time to make some noise. Not unorganized, cacaphonous, grating noise but a unified voice expressing our outrage at how our rights, our health, the safety of our very water and land are being taken away without our permission. The example we should follow is from the Civil Rights Movement, that is, civil disobedience. Green Party candidate Jill Stein performed a perfect act of civil disobedience at Standing Rock. She has been charged with misdemeanor vandalism and trespass. She received national news coverage and numerous newspaper stories she otherwise wouldn't have received. Yeah, I know that's not a catchy phrase, but I'm certain you can come up with a much better one. And I'm even more certain you can come up with ways to demonstrate your anger against the tyrannical one percent. Global Weeks of Action against the pipeline run from now until September 17th. Visit the website at nodaplsolidarity.org and take advantage of the media and outreach materials and an excellent list of links to nonviolent direct action resources. On Tuesday, September 13, there will be a nationwide Day of Action with events throughout the country calling on President Obama to revoke the permits for this pipeline. Go to this link and enter your zip code to see if there's an event planned near you. If there isn't, please consider starting your own. Tell your friends, family and neighbors to sign up as well. If you're not able to travel or get out in public, other ways to help the cause is to write letters to the editor of newspapers, tweet, email and make phone calls to the companies and individuals responsible for the Dakota Access Pipeline in the first place. You'll recognize a lot of them--CitiCorp, Goldman Sachs, Sunoco, Marathon Petroleum, Phillips 66. You might even find one of their places of business in your city. Plan a direct action event there if you can. The main thing to keep in mind is to stay on message. The people of Standing Rock are staying on message. Eventually. In all honesty, probably not. But we will see some change in the hearts and minds of our fellow Americans. Together, we will realize a better world for all. I may not get there with you. We will get to the Promise Land. But first we must stand together and stand tall with the water protectors of Standing Rock. Update 7 PM, 9-9-16: Joint Statement from the Department of Justice, the Department of the Army and the Department of the Interior Regarding Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. In short, the Army told the Corps of Engineers to halt (for now). We're not out of the woods yet, so keep up the noise. Don't let them forget we're not stopping until the Dakota Access Pipeline project is shut down for good. According to Brand New Congress: Just today, a judge denied the tribe's request to stop construction of the pipeline. Fortunately, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers replied to that, and refused to authorize its construction on Corps land, but the tribe's lands are far from being safe. The permits for the pipeline need to be fully revoked. Below are some of the ways we can all pitch in: Donate money or supplies directly to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Contribute to the legal defense fund for Sacred Stone Spirit Camp. Contribute to the Sacred Stone Camp gofundme page. If you are unable to donate or send supplies, you can: Call the North Dakota Governor at 701-328-2200. Let him know what you think of what he is allowing to happen to these lands. Call the Army Corp of Engineers at 202-761-5903. Demand that they reverse the permit for the building of the pipeline. The vast majority of scientists tell us that climate change is real, it is caused by humans and it is already causing devastating problems. They say that if we do not aggressively transition our energy system away from fossil fuels toward energy efficiency and sustainable energy, the planet we leave our children will be a much less habitable place. As a nation, our job is to break our addiction to fossil fuels, not increase our dependence on oil.

But every picture and every story that comes out of Standing Rock hits with such impact that the great distance seems negligible. I am a child of the Dakotas. I was born in North Dakota. I spent almost every holiday and summer in the Badlands of North Dakota, or with family in the Black Hills of South Dakota. When I was young, my family moved to the prairies of Saskatchewan, Canada, but we stayed close, just a few miles above the border. My childhood memories of the Dakotas and the Canadian prairies have blended, forming idyllic vignettes of golden sunsets, gorgeous but fierce winters and peaceful life out West. One thing that always stood out to me in the Dakotas was the deep respect for Native American culture and history. I always felt a profound sense of love and respect for our brothers and sisters. I grew up having a real connection to the land and to the people and cultures that have always called it home. When I was very young, I had a doll that I named Paha Sapa, which means Black Hills in the language of the Lakota Sioux. The Sioux have been a part of my life since I was born, ever-present brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, grandparents and ancestors. I am forever tied to this place. My loved ones are buried there. The battle for Standing Rock has been an incredible thing to witness. Thousands of people are standing in support of the Sioux. Millions of people have offered their support and donations. But I am deeply conflicted. There is no valid argument to not modify the location of the pipeline. In the interest of giving the benefit of the doubt, maybe the planners were careless. Dakota Access, LLC and Energy Transfer Partners have based their entire claim on the fact that the Sioux no longer have legal claim over the land. But their legal ground is as shaky as their moral one. The Dawes Act of 1887 helped to usher in waves of white settlers on Sioux land. The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation is one of six fragments created when Congress split up the Great Sioux Reservation on March, 2, 1889. The legality of these actions are beyond question. Many people are familiar with the massacres and war, but the shadowy history of cultural warfare was conducted quietly under the auspices of legal policies. In his 1889 annual report to the Secretary of the Interior. They must adjust themselves to their environment, and conform their mode of living substantially to our civilization. This civilization may not be the best possible, but it is the best the Indians can get. Clearly, the people behind DAPL are taking advantage of acts that should not have been legal, and are asserting that the Sioux only have claim over their territory. The Standing Rock Sioux are opposing an unfair risk to their land and health. For the last decade, I have seen my home destroyed as the big oil boom attracted thousands eager to exploit the land. The landscape is unrecognizable. There have been more spills than can be counted. You can see a visible scar stretching through parts of North Dakota and Saskatchewan, left by heavy tankers, filthy trains, and the traffic caused by the thousands of extra workers. Where once we could stand in complete darkness and count the stars, we now see dozens of flares from oil wells. The towns of Williston, ND, and Estevan, SK, have exploded in population, and have seen a corresponding explosion in crime, drugs, and homelessness. There are not enough houses for everyone coming to work in the oil fields. Of course, big hotels and apartment complexes were hastily constructed to profit from the boom. I understand and empathize with the concern over jobs. Replacing coal and oil with renewables will change a lot, for a whole lot of people. It is home to two major coal power plants that provide power to millions, and jobs to thousands. My dad worked at both of them. When I saw that Canada aims to phase out coal by 2030, my heart sank. Places that have fueled society for decades with government-operated power plants. When we talk about phasing out fossil fuels, we can easily point to the destruction and devastation left in their wake. I can look at my ruined prairies and grieve for the beauty that is lost. But when we talk about phasing out fossil fuels, we have to remember to not forget about the Estevans, the Willistons, the Dakotas and Saskatchewans that have been diligently bearing the cost of fossil fuels while the rest of us reap the benefits. These costs are real and measurable, not just potential collateral damage. The conversation about these costs usually focuses heavily on controlling emissions to avoid or mitigate future risks. But pollution already poses a direct and severe threat to public health. While I was growing up I suffered from several cases of bronchitis and pneumonia, and I was once hospitalized for a week with pneumonia in both of my lungs. I will suffer from asthma and higher susceptibility to pneumonia for the rest of my life, as will many others who grew up in Estevan or similar towns with air pollution. I am another veteran who has taken the oath to defend the Constitution of the United States, and I stand with the Standing Rock Sioux. That is what the oath means, and it means more now than ever. As someone of the Dakotas, I stand with my brothers and sisters, and Standing Rock, as well as Fort Berthold. I also stand up for my fellow Dakotans and Saskatchewanians, and I am saying enough is enough. We need to end this dependence on oil."}, {"URL": "http://thefreethoughtproject.com/standing-rock-sioux-offer-amazing-lesson-compassion-donate-supplies-law-enforcement/#fFJhKW5RhtQZrCb3.99", "Timestamp": "20180918224122", "Sentences": "In spite of widespread brutality and violent actions directed at non-violent unarmed water protectors by law enforcement, the Oceti Sakowin headsman, joined by Leonard Crow Dog and a number of youth and women leaders, delivered the requested donations to their oppressors.

They hated the way it tasted, etc. I of course, after getting over my disbelief went into a rant about how someday water will be more precious than anything. That is something that was taught to me by my grandfather, taught to him by his grandfather. The Lakota prophecy that dates back at least 300 years talks of all the water turning black someday. It says by the time white people realize how precious water is, it will be too late. People in North Dakota are so quick to defend oil and disregard water, as if oil is needed more than water. They are quick to throw their railroad workers under the train in order to put pipeline down without once thinking what they would do without water, how they would live. As Native people, we know the power of water, we know water can save our lives. Water can also in huge force take a whole village out in a flood. There is power in water, we are made of water which is why when it is sacrificed in ceremony for 4 days by Natives, it is done in a constant state of prayer in the hot sun. Water is used in every aspect of our lives, we know that it is our first medicine. Which is why hundred of tribes have come together in this fight for water. This is the challenge I issued on facebook. Being that so many politicians, corporations, and the average caucasian North Dakotan thinks that water is not important, here is the challenge. You can not have anything to do with water for 24 hours. This means no flushing a toilet, no washing your face, no drinking anything with water. No eating any portion that needed water to sustain it, no eating any crop that had anything to do with water. No drinking anything that needed water to make, being that everything has water in it including soda, about the only thing on this list is oil. No brushing your teeth, showering, or even going fishing. No going on a boat, no going swimming, no washing your clothes, no water in your life for 24 hours. I realize this is impossible for mostly everyone. Mostly everyone does not know that water is given up for 4 days and nights in the summer time during ceremony by the very same people who are fighting to protect their water. If you think you are ok without sacred water, then take this challenge. I realize not even the strongest man or woman can do this or even the richest, however, should you decide to take it, post it. Let us know truthfully how many minutes or hours you lasted. It is impossible. I only wanted them to think about it. Then I had a friend of mine step in who is non-native. I was thinking this was a good thing because most of us Natives know of someone or maybe have sacrificed water on their own in ceremony before. My own brother did and I remember him telling me the fasting of food for four days is not what got to him, it was the thirst for water. He said every cell in his body could think of nothing else but water for the whole four days. Animals and plants already know the importance of water, even more so than most humans. So Brooke lives in Florida, works in the health field, and decided to do the challenge on her day off. I will tell you about her day according to her notes. Brooke woke up at 9am and her first thought was water. How normally she would shower and drink water, brush her teeth, etc. She used the bathroom to urinate but did not flush the toilet. It bothered her to not wash her hands because she works in the health field she is constantly washing her hands all day. She thought about breakfast but had nothing to eat that did not use water to make. She broke down at 1:20 pm and made coffee because of a dependence on caffeine. Her challenge at that point was over, but she tried to keep going. Her mind was constantly on water wondering if she could eat the bananas outside but being they used rainwater to grow, they still involved water. At 2:10pm she started doing laundry for the work week but her electricity went out, showing her again, how important water was. At 3:00pm she finally broke down and drank a glass of water and tapped out completely. She lasted 4 hours and 20 minutes without water. Another hour without needing it to clean and another hour before her thirst took over. I asked her if she was bored without water. She said yes, it was such a distraction it was all she could think about, not being able to concentrate on anything else. She said she felt spoiled by having access to water constantly and she realized why there is a fight for clean water going on. I think of the children in Africa who get their water from mud puddles, I think of the power of water in lands that are shrinking due to melting glaciers, I think of the power of water in tsunamis. I think of water all the time and how the Lakota prophecy predicted that one day it will be more precious than anything. I think of the people on my reservation who still live with no running water. I think of the people in North Dakota who are too clueless to realize the fight for oil is about money. The fight for water is about life. Because water is our first medicine. Water is life. Mni Wiconi. We can not live without water."}, {"URL": "https://plus.google.com/104553282398354948134/posts/2UyTmA1ki6E?_utm_source=199-1-1", "Timestamp": "20180919010315", "Sentences": "403.

Source: CNN Veterans Stand for Standing Rock The leaders of this effort are Michael A. Wood Jr. and Wesley Clark Jr. Curious as to the background and capabilities of Michael A. Wood Jr. and Wesley Clark Jr., I reviewed their background and some of the other initiatives they have supported. Mr. Wood was a member of the USMC and a Baltimore City Police Officer. He started seeking media attention in conjunction with the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore. He takes a hard-stance against his former colleagues at the Baltimore Police Department in numerous interviews with the press and became a minor celebrity in Baltimore with his timely allegations of police wrong doing. Your job is to fight crime, and these are the guys you do it with. This is the culture. He clearly admits that he did nothing to address his concerns while employed by the BPD and spent 11 years being part of the perceived problem. I especially would not be part of an operation that has declared that it will engage the local Sheriff and the U.S. Government as the opposition and the enemies of the people. I also find their support of numerous George Soros sponsored Globalist agenda items (global warming, gun confiscation, federalized control of police, etc.) suspect. Certainly most Oath Keepers would oppose the positions of that these individuals have taken with regard to the Bill of Rights, especially with regard to the 2nd Amendment. Lofty goals like saving the planet from climate change provide insight to these individuals thinking and politics. My personal opinion is that they are self-promoting grand standers that wait for a cause to help them promote themselves and then jump in. I scoured their writings and social media activity for any mention of the Dakota Access Pipeline BEFORE it became a media sensation and found nothing. The North Dakota veterans said even being in the area is adding to the conflict that exists and that goes against what they took their oaths for. Conclusion Follow these young men out the Standing Rock at your own risk. Based on their history, I cannot imagine their efforts will improve the situation for either the Standing Rock Sioux or the people of North Dakota. 0 Navy Jack During my service I deployed on various platforms, including submarines, amphibious assault units and special boats. I participated in expeditionary and humanitarian missions to the North Atlantic, Iran, Beirut, Libya, and the Caribbean. I am a Patron Life Member of the NRA. I am an Oath Keeper Life Member. Protesting is one thing, but I take issue with his deliberate attempt at tarnishing the image of veterans, his waffling on what it is to keep his oath, and his promoting the falsehood in a connection between big oil and the climate. The hypocrisy floods from his mouth and his actions. RussL says: December 3, 2016 at 1:17 pm His conflicted ideology is likely due to some girl he likes. Anyone choosing to be lead by this foolish young man, have tough life lessons ahead. The way people stood together, forcing Bureau of Land Management to retreat, was a great inspiration for those of us who love liberty and the Constitution. We who love liberty share a common problem with those on the left. But what each side sees as the solution could not be more diametrically opposed. The tribe completely failed to come to the table and negotiate or even discuss ANY alternative plans prior to construction, even though they were repeatedly given opportunities to do so. Had they been fighting this all along, it would have been one thing. By the time the first gallon of oil flows down the pipeline, that water intake will be shut down. So I have a hard time supporting the cause overall, let alone these two fools. Your concerns about the one-sided nature of the MSM coverage is accurate. We will be telling the rest of the story. It is more than we envisioned when we began investigating it. Having said this, he may be one of those rare opportunities to reach across aisles and find some common ground to work upon. I suspect there is more than grandstanding going on here. The whole idea of an unarmed resistance is quite comical to me personally. They are at a great tactical disadvantage and strategically inept. As someone on the Southern Border, it is of great importance to me to see this resistance stopped ASAP. I joined OK 2009 hoping that there was finally a group of people who would follow the rule of law, including Niitsitaapii natural, inherent rights to the land Creator gave us. Reparations have and should continue to be considered for these transgressions. It seems that OK adheres to the narrative that when in doubt blame Soros and than we do not have to look at the full spectrum of factors and conditions that need to come together to create a certain situation. Time to be sincere and acknowledge the legitimate grievances of other segments of the population. I have stated that many times. I also do not doubt the sincerity of most of the protesters at Standing Rock. The issue is the false narrative that generates the extreme emotions leading to violence. The issue is the instigators of violence imported to what always starts as a peaceful protest. I have thoroughly referenced this article. I have used their articles, statement and their published plans. The conclusions are accurate. Jeru says: December 4, 2016 at 12:30 pm You have referenced the article with pieces that support a particular narrative and adhere to a particular agenda. That is not that hard to do in an situation where elitist corporatist entities are waging an all out offensive of false information to create a division in the citizenry. The globalist agenda is not that of the civil rights and environmental protection groups that you try to demonize as being mere Soros fronts. The globalist agenda is in essence that of the fossil fuel industry and the Wall Street banks that finance this pipeline. This is the power structure of the oligarchic corporatocracy that is the thriving force behind the disappearance of the American working class, the decline of the middle class and are the instigators of regime changes and foreign wars. All these oligarchs have the same agenda and you are misled if you do not see this is a class struggle of the wealthy elites against the rest of the population. The population have legitimate grievances but are being divided along lines of identity politics and so are people in the law enforcement and the military. All of the references regarding the use of Standing Rock and initiatives like this as a weapon against the future President also came from the promoters of the Standing Rock occupation and their parent organization. You have no argument. I will simplify this. Both of these premises are untrue. Both of these premises originated with Indigenous Rising Media. Without these two false narratives, this protest would have never attracted the participation of thousands. Without these two premises, the tribe has no legal standing or arguable case. This has already been through the courts. The answer is to use this protest as a prototype for future stands against what they see as an intolerable President. These are their words, not mine. This is their stated strategy in their publications and in their promotion of the Standing Rock event. Clean air and drinking water are the most valuable commodities we have as human beings. These necessities for life are what all of us should be working together to protect for our children and the generations to come. The transnational corporations and large financial institutions only care about their profit margins and will override the well being of the citizenry for motives of pure greed. If you want to believe the rhetoric of conspiracies and ulterior motives that is being created to discredit environmentalists and civil right groups to make you more comfortable with the self serving stance you have taken on these issues then that is your choice. Unfortunately it is not going to be bringing forth mutual understanding and will not protect our environment and our civil rights from the greed of the corporate state. The financial institutions on Wall Street are not serving the interests of the general population and we will unfortunately see a larger financial collapse than that of 2008 as a result of their unbridled greed. Let us remain confident we can all come together as brothers and sisters to work towards a healthier and sustainable future that protects the justice and equality of all citizens. Not just protect the interests of the upper echelon that is actually exploiting the citizenry. Unfortunately, the globalists do work through the environmental groups to achieve their goals. UN Agenda 21 and 2030, both globalist frameworks, speak to the setting aside of vast amounts of land to be kept from the resident population. Having been an avid supporter of the work of environmental groups, disillusionment quickly set in when I learned that once such land was set aside, it immediately became off limits to the public and that corporate lumber, mineral, and fracking rights were negotiated and granted by the government. Hence, bury head in sand and go on with business as usual. Greg K says: December 4, 2016 at 9:50 pm Glad you saw the light Jacqueline. Very rare indeed. I went back to college to get my degree in ESRP. Believe this; I earned every bit of it. My whole premise was to get as close to the real science, and issues as possible, so that I could be a doer and not a spewer. In fact that is true today as it was 4 years ago. Heck, I just got rousted by the Game Dept. today. All because their sign was missing. manages. Thank you my relative, you are correct. I have relations on the ground at Standing Rock. Yes, movements get co-opted sometimes, but the movement continues, the reporting by MSM stops but the people on the ground continue. Perfect case in point is the Black Lives Matter group where a handful of opportunists like Deray Mckesson got himself hundreds of visits to the White House, a well-paying job, and fame. Meanwhile, DeRay now claims he is not a member of BLM, now that he and a handful of sellouts accomplished their goal of slowing down a powerful movement and dissuading more people from joining. What is happening at Standing Rock is a powerful, spiritual movement that has been ongoing since the Great Immigration. There were always groups of goodheart people like the Quakers, who united with our Native peoples and recognized and fought against the genocide of our people, as there are groups and elected officials that will do everything possible to prevent the unity of all races, creeds, identities from uniting. Those groups are the real danger to all freedom loving peoples. the brave warriors who joined him have done at Oceti Sakowin camp is the beginning of mending the Sacred Hoop. His mission to apologize and make amends for over 500 years of continuing genocide & our rights to live on the land Creator gave us to care for, is beyond precedent. M&T bank & the Go Fund Me site they used with held the monies donated to Wes & he & Mike Woods are working to straighten that out, but people are attacking them, NOT the banks & funding sites that kept the money. The peoples group or the one that sustains the global hegemony, sides with the oligarchs & multi-national corporations and fears unity of the masses, equality & justice for all.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii, a combat war veteran, will be joining the act of resistance, according to the Facebook page Veterans Stand for Standing Rock. As Task and Purpose notes, federal government ignored their duty under the National Historic Preservation Act to consult the Standing Rock Sioux before approving DAPL. While federal government abandoned Native Americans once again, law enforcement are acting as militarized protection services for Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based company behind the 1,170-mile pipeline. State and local governments are set to reap millions in taxes once the oil begins flowing. The main man behind it all is Wes Clark, Jr., son of Gen. Wesley Clark, a former Supreme Allied Commander who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. Clark Sr. called for action on climate change, and this motivation is also driving his son to fight against DAPL. Clark and Wood say they are prepared to take a bullet for the cause, and they are going in well-prepared. The veterans will don old military uniforms and be equipped with body armor, ear plugs and gas masks. A packing list virtually mirrors the ones issued to soldiers preparing to deploy to the field (minus the weapons). But there are also parts of the document that read like a revolutionary manifesto. With a group of possibly 500 veterans and other brave souls, they will lock arms and cross the Missouri River to non-violently confront militarized police armed with rifles, mace, batons and dogs. Traditional Sioux war songs will be played as they attempt to peacefully surround the drill pad from which the pipeline will be bored under the river.

They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline.

That place is Standing Rock, the reservation where legendary Lakota holy man Sitting Bull was killed by Indian police in 1890. Instead, most of the songs advance the narrative, including discussions between characters, a technique that moves the story rapidly along. But mostly it's atmospheric and reverby, getting darker as the story progresses. For me, it works quite effectively. My only suggestion, especially on the harder rocking songs: crank it up.

I live in Lawton, Oklahoma. I was born and raised in Carnegie, Oklahoma. I graduated from high school but have no college degrees. I am 62 years old and retired. I am a daughter, a mother, a grandmother. I was fresh out of high school in 1972 and I was on the verge of being kicked out of junior college because my grades were failing. I was already turning into a full-fledged alcoholic, and I was in a bar crying in my beer. I was sipping on my beer and thinking how much of a fuck-up I was. So after that, in my mind, I was not good enough for anything or anybody. So I just started drinking to ease the pain. So I was sitting there that night in 1972, and I heard a door open in the bar and I saw a couple of guys come in. They had long braids, long ponytails, jeans jackets, and boots. Then more came in and started playing pool, and then they asked if they could sit at my table. So we started conversing and I asked where they were from. As a Native American I had been sheltered as a child. But growing up in Carnegie, I had faced racism, prejudice. So I got interested in his story. In tenth grade I had left Carnegie and graduated from Lawton McArthur. It was a governmental program to see how Native students would react and how they would succeed. So they chose students from different tribes, and we lived on campus. So that was my way of escaping from my perpetrator. But it was a governmental program, and we did live by the rules and regs of the boarding school. We got up at a certain time; we had chores; we attended activities. I got to see the diversity of different races, and I got to know a lot of children from other tribes and nations. And I wanted to know more about the world and about different places and different kinds of people. Even to this day, I still love all the colors. And when colonialism comes in you have to live by their rules. But as Native Americans we have our ways; we have our cultures; we have our traditions; we have our stories; we have our dances; we have our songs; we have our language. So that is what the takeover of the BIA was all about. He invited me to join them. They raised me in the church. So all I knew about was going to church almost every night. So I took that opportunity that night, and I chose AIM. AIM was founded in Minneapolis-St. Paul. The police there were like they are today. They were beating people in the streets. So AIM formed out of that, and it became a spiritual movement. We wanted our sovereignty; we wanted our rights back; we wanted what was taken from us. Yes, we are the First Nation, but we know our place because we are the People of the Land. We watch over and take care of what was given to us. So when I went with AIM that night I was trying to find myself. They were bodyguards. There were Creeks and Seminoles, Choctaws, and the leader from Oklahoma AIM back then, who I respect and honor. God bless him: It was Carter Camp of the Ponca Nation. He sat right by me. All the men in the group respected me as a sister; in return, I gave them the same respect. I got to meet Russell Means and Dennis Banks. I got to live with the Seattle AIM people, and that is where I met Leonard Peltier. In my spirit, I can feel things going on in the Native world. So when I got to meet all these people, we started traveling and ended up in Minneapolis. They were calling all the AIM chapters to come into Rapid City. There were things going on in Pine Ridge. There were murders. They had a takeover because ranchers had murdered a Lakota man. Then there was another one in Custer where two guys had murdered another Lakota man. And so we were called out. We hitched around. Back in the day we all just took care of each other. We jumped in with a guy who had a car and went to Rapid City. I saw all the Oklahoma AIM people there. We got to meet our old friends. There were just three of us Kiowas, so we were glad to see each other. We waited around there for about a week. We even had drills. So they called us militants. I had stopped. Our way comes from the herbs; our way comes from the ground; our way comes from the air. You have to have a balance in your life. You get alone somewhere; you go to the mountains. You go to your sacred places to pray. And this is where the misunderstanding comes from about why AIM was there. We got the call from the elders of the Pine Ridge Reservation; they wanted the people from AIM to help them. Copyright Kevin McKiernan When we arrived, there was a meeting and somebody brought the drum and there was singing and round dancing and just having a good time gathering outside. Then they had us stop and wait for the chiefs from the Lakota and the Dakota people. And the chiefs came in, and some of them had their war bonnets on. And you know, back in school, they always told us that the chiefs were dead and gone. They started singing songs for the chiefs, giving honor to the chiefs. Just to talk about it brings a lump to my throat. And I was in the front line. We caravanned into Pine Ridge. Copyright Kevin McKiernan The reason we were called into Pine Ridge was because of the reign of Dickey Wilson, who was the tribal leader. He was abusing his authority; he was abusing and misusing money. And he had men that were called goons, and they were terrorizing and murdering innocent people. And if you were considered an associate of AIM, you were a target for the goons. You were either beaten or found dead somewhere on the reservation. Anyone and everyone that was with AIM was a sitting duck. Those times were called the reign of terror. We wanted people to be able to live in peace, to be able to go out of their homes and go to the store and not have to look over their shoulder. And, yes, we ransacked the grocery store, and yes, we ransacked the museum, and yes, we ransacked the post office. When we took over that night, we took what we needed. We took all the objects that were in the museum because the trading post was used as a pawn shop. There was bead work and artwork that the people had pawned in order for them to feed their families. They gathered all those irreplaceable items up so they could give them back to the owners. People used to say that there were hostages. The business owners were given the option to stay or go and there were some that stayed because they believed in what we were there for. We were there about Dickey Wilson but also to let the government know that we were going to take a stand AGAIN. Because there was Alcatraz, the BIA, and Wounded Knee. The government wants the Black Hills because there is gold in them hills; there is minerals in them hills. What is happening in Standing Rock today is happening for a reason. We are the life-givers of this world. We are the ones that have to carry, bear, and raise the children. It made me strong; it made me proud of who I am. It gave me back my confidence, my boldness, and my courage. When they were going against the enemy, they used to count coup. You go and you hit once, and you count coup. You hit one time and you count coup. Well, instead of hitting one time, my namesake hit twice on his coup. I am a descendant of old Chief Lone Wolf who comes from Red Cloud of the Lakota people. So we have this new president coming into office, and you and I will be marching on the day after he gets inaugurated. And if it does not pertain to what he should be doing as a president, we the people have a right to impeach him. Some of the tribes have already sold out to the oil companies. And Trump has already sold out to the oil companies. To me, he is another dictator, like Dickey Wilson. As a Kiowa woman, I am very honored to use my last name. I had a close encounter with death and with two of the fatalities inside Wounded Knee. We arranged to speak again that night. Give Annie H Hartnett a round of applause.

They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do.

His alter-ego was done, and he had to break up the band. Invitation only, the audience comprised members of the David Bowie fan club, the rock press, musicians, and other lucky people. This would turn out to be the very last time that Mick Ronson and Trevor Bolder would play with Bowie as the Spiders. Joining the band was pianist Mike Garson, who had been a part of the Ziggy tour and the recently released Aladdin Sane, and whose sound is unmistakable here. Bowie also has three black back-up singers, a first sign of the sounds he would explore in Young Americans. Unlike a concert run-through, the three days of filming featured each number rehearsed separately and filmed multiple times. For one thing, it allowed Bowie the chance to change costumes for each song, wearing some of the most outlandish outfits of his Ziggy era, designed by Freddie Burretti. For the finale, Bowie joined her onstage. Also on the tape are introductions from one Amanda Lear, a velvet-voiced blonde who had a very intriguing career--Salvador Dali protege, Rolling Stone groupie, David Bowie lover, Italo-disco star, nude model, possible transsexual. So yes, a perfect host for what was at that time both a high-water mark for glam rock and a visit to the future. As we approach the one year anniversary of David Bowie's death, which seemed to send the Grim Reaper on a killing spree, there's plenty of the Starman's career to discover and re-discover...and to be released.

The demonstrations drew worldwide attention as protesters and officers clashed amid mass arrests, fires and law enforcement tactics that drew criticism. Almost a year after officers cleared the protest camps, about 300 protest defendants still face criminal charges. Kirchmeier said his first term went well and he would like to continue to improve efficiency in his office. Promotions last month of 11 officers have helped that, he added.

Last year a big American oil company felt bad because it was getting picked on by anti-fracking activists who were hurling insults on Twitter . The oil company wanted to do something, anything, to stop those misguided fracktivists who were only propagating long disproven fracking propaganda. But first the oil company had to figure out how to work this Twitter thing. They noticed that some tweets spread virally, get retweeted all over the place. While other tweets saying pretty much the same thing just fall flat. But that was kind of a bad idea. Before engaging with its Twitter enemies the big oil company was smart enough to reach out to IBM for advice. Some questions don't require supercomputers to answer. Welch's team suggested to the oil company that it not get too hasty about defending itself on Twitter. Instead, have Watson analyze the problem. then surely it can figure out how to cope with those anti-fracking dopes. Gallery: 50 Billionaires To Follow On Twitter 50 images View gallery In order for an oil company to connect with its antagonists over Twitter, it needed to use the language that the community was using. Leave it to IBM to use artificial intelligence to reverse-engineer authenticity. Welch explains that the supercomputer has become adept at parsing Twitter, thanks to a project begun five years ago. Bad handwriting aside, these patient records are a challenge for normal brains to make sense of because of all the jargon and abbreviations. Maternal great-grandmother. The supercomputer teases out meaning and significance by looking at the context in which words are placed. IBM previously helped the Florida State Police scour Twitter to identify new nicknames for illegal drugs. Part of the challenge was that new names cycled in and out of usage so quickly that their half-life on Twitter was just a week. To teach Watson how to identify drug tweets out of the millions of non-drug tweets, IBM starts by feeding Watson tweets that definitely contain drug names. The computer looks at the words used with those names, in tandem with those names, and catalogs them. Eventually IBM could hook up Watson to one of the commercially available feeds that enable the supercomputer to drink from the Twitter firehose in its entirety. Watson scans for words common to drug tweets, then looks to see if the words are arranged in ways common to drug tweets. When it finds tweets meeting those criteria, voila, it deduces that the unfamiliar new word sitting where a drug nickname usually goes must be a new drug nickname. Rather, the idea behind the drug tweets program was to show that Watson can monitor and take note of minute changes in the Twitter language commonly used by people tweeting about a particular interest group. In order to talk to the anti-frackers over Twitter, the oil company needed to understand what language they were speaking. Welch says that when his team set out to monitor the Twitter rantings of anti-fracking groups , they knew that they wanted to find the most creative and inspirational tweets. To that end, IBM gave Watson a dictionary of keywords to start with, things like fracking, tarsands, poison, water, pollution, evil, shale, gas, fracked. Then they fed Watson 40 million retweets to ponder. They use retweets because an original tweet must have contained something resonant if it inspired someone else to retweet it. Watson filtered out all the retweets that contained one of the keywords, then it catalogued all the other words appearing in those retweets. It logged how often those words are used and in what contexts and patterns. A word found to resonate more with re-tweeters earns a higher ringscore. A tweet composed of high-ringscore words by definition is one that gets retweeted more widely than one with low-ringscore words. The former of course. Sometimes the duration of a high-ringscore word is far shorter. Movie premiers and trailers get a lot of exposure on Twitter. A client asked IBM to look at tweets surrounding the premier of Godzilla. And Watson can help the company craft its tweets, reflecting its own point of view, using high ringscore words most likely to resonate with the anti-fracking crowd. But if your company has tens of thousands of dollars a month to spare, you can try it out yourself. Welch says that Watson now provides the oil company client with an early warning of new attacks launched by anti-fracking forces. Like the time when chefs in San Francisco started a Twitter thread about how beef from Pennsylvania was tainted because the cattle grazing near drilling sites targeting the Marcellus shale had been drinking water polluted by fracking flowback water. IBM says the company quickly funded a UC Berkeley professor to do a study debunking the assertion, and the controversy quickly died out. It turned out to be a campaign that had been coordinated on Facebook , then executed on Twitter. The rest of us will just have to try to be as clever as we can be with our tweets. Observation changes the observed. Too much observation, whether noticeable by users or not, could drive people away from Twitter to new, less public, forums. Alternatively, think of how much better Twitter might be if users were a little more creative and eloquent in their tweets. To that end, Welch shared a bit of Twitter wisdom we should all remember.

A client asked IBM to look at tweets surrounding the premier of Godzilla. &a;ldquo;In looking at Godzilla tweets, they found &a;lsquo;dope as shit&a;rsquo; was the number on positive-sentiment phrase.

The oil company now employs Watson&a;rsquo;s Twitter editor not just for tweets sent out via its own corporate account, but also from accounts that are not obviously associated with the oil company. Unfortunately IBM so far hasn&a;rsquo;t been willing to share any specific before-and-after tweets improved by the editor. Like the time when chefs in San Francisco started a Twitter thread about how beef from Pennsylvania was tainted because the cattle grazing near drilling sites targeting the Marcellus shale had been drinking water polluted by fracking flowback water. The company started seeing lots of similar anti-oil tweets coming in, but they couldn&a;rsquo;t tell where the campaign came from because there were no signs on Twitter that it had been coordinated. course, IBM would be happy to share Watson&a;rsquo;s Twitter editor with any clients who can afford it.

The police attack on an estimated 400 people included a barrage of rubber bullets, tear gas, concussion grenades, and pelts of icy water despite the freezing temperatures. At least 16 people were arrested on Monday after continued demonstrations. Pls share this. For months, the North Dakota Access Pipeline has been protested by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of nearly 100 other tribes from across the United States. Many non-Native activists have joined as allies, including environmentalist and founder of 350.org Bill McKibben, who is urging the American public to pay attention by reporting through his personal twitter page. The refrain of the protest is simple: clean water is not a political issue. From the contaminated drinking water in Flint, Michigan to the escalated urgency of the North Dakota Access Pipeline protests, this reality means problems surrounding clean water access are not likely to fade away quietly. The outcome of this battle, and the way it gets told, may set the stage for similar environmental and humanitarian disputes yet to come. For members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the pipeline is a major environmental and cultural threat. It has everything to do with language. The conflict for them rests firmly on the notion that this is yet another trespass sanctioned by the state against the Native American way of life. Tribes coming from the Brazilian Amazon seeking an American audience, too, are asking the public to do more to protect their way of life. For many of the members, it was their first time out of Brazil. They performed music to a crowd of over a hundred at the Tibet House. Their musical performance told the story of their disappearing ecosystem and language which belongs to the Panoan language family. Linguists estimate that approximately 1250 people speak it fluently. But younger generations are losing connection to the ancestral land and culture, opting to adapt to city life in hopes of greater economic gain. In the case of the North Dakota Access Pipeline, sacred ancestral land and clean drinking water is at stake. Both tribes are at odds with the dominant economic system. There is a documented correlation between the number of human languages present in an ecosystem, and the number of thriving animal and plant species. According to National Geographic, one language dies every 14 days. What is transpiring at the North Dakota Access pipeline is a battle of mindsets. A battle of narratives. Their conflict is urgent.

For a while, it looked like Standing Rock would achieve the impossible. The tribe's opposition drew thousands to what was arguably the largest demonstration of tribal sovereignty and call for environmental justice in history as Archambault, the tribal chairman, pleaded his case before members of Congress and the United Nations. In early December, the Obama administration called for a more thorough environmental review that would take years to complete. The review was never carried out. President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for work on the pipeline to be expedited soon after his January inauguration. Archambault was vilified by members of his tribe who suffered economic fallout from the protests on a reservation already plagued by poverty. When the chairman urged the protesters to go home, they accused Archambault of selling out. In September, Archambault lost his bid for re-election to an opponent who said it was time to move on. In his first in-depth interview since his election loss, Archambault spoke candidly with InsideClimate News about his time as chairman of the Standing Rock Tribe, the NoDAPL movement, and what comes next for tribal sovereignty, environmental justice and for him personally. This interview was edited for length and clarity. That was where I saw for the first time tribes across this nation, from around the world, come to Standing Rock and stand together. We could never anticipate what was going to happen, but it was about time that the federal government finally listened to indigenous people. The Standing Rock tribe and their supporters carried out months of protest in an effort to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline from being built. The pipeline carries crude oil under the Missouri River, which the tribe relies on for drinking water and considers sacred. Archambault: There were things that were happening, people were healing and their discussion was shifting to forgiveness. There was generosity, there were a lot of the virtues and values that our ancestors passed down to us that were actually presenting themselves and letting us experience what it truly means to be living with these values. It was special. It was a place where you always wanted to be. You didn't want to leave. Archambault: No. I never imagined it would be as big as it is, and it's not in the past tense, it's still happening. It had to happen no matter what, it was inevitable, and it could have happened anywhere. It could have happened on the Rosebud Reservation, when the KXL pipeline was coming through. There are all these different threats to indigenous people and to their lands. It had to happen because the country continues to infringe on our rights and our lands, so making a stand was going to happen and it's still going because we still have a lot of these threats coming. Standing Rock supporters took their fight to Washington and the White House. Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II met with Congress and the president in 2016 to argue their case for stopping the pipeline. Trump came in, the pipeline was still going under the river, there was information disseminated through Facebook about me, about how I was selling out, which was far from the truth. I never changed who I was from the very beginning. Whenever anybody is in a position like this and something great is happening, the people want to elevate them. They elevate individuals almost like stars. When that happens, it's easy to love somebody who is a star, but in a split second, it's easy to hate that person. I never wanted to be anybody in this whole thing, because it's really a slippery slope when that hate comes on. I'm thankful that the membership of Standing Rock gave me the opportunity to be their chairman and that they gave me the opportunity to run again. But I think things happen the way they are supposed to happen, so that we can continue to move forward and advance, not just Standing Rock but all of Indian Country. I'm in a good place, and I think it's the way it's supposed to be. There is a lot less weight on my shoulders now that I am not the chairman, and I can feel it, I'm a lot lighter. ICN: Tell me more about that weight. A 960 is a form that is filled out when there is suspicion of neglect or abuse of children. My initial reaction was, we've got to do something about this right now, and I was not in the position to do that. It now is the responsibility of the new chairman. That was the first time that I realized that, man that's a tough job to carry. To know that they're out there, and to know that we don't have the adequate resources to address all the 960s, and then to carry that, people don't realize what a chairman has to go through until they are actually in that position. Some 40 percent of the Standing Rock reservation's 8,200 residents live below the poverty line. The community suffers from high rates of unemployment, alcoholism and suicide, and housing is so scarce that multiple families often cram into a single dwelling. Archambault: I think it was just our membership was ready for new leadership. It could have been a lot of things that came into play. We are in a state of dependency, we have a high poverty rate, a high unemployment rate, we have all of the abuses, and when you are in that state, the interest to try to get immediate gratification is there. It's very hard to be looking out into the future. So, all the things that I've done, the way I base my decisions and the way I can sleep at night, is I had to say 'no' a lot to our membership, and I had to say 'yes' when I knew that the impact was going to be good for our future, so looking out further than today, or tomorrow, or next year. It's really hard to do that, but that is the reason why I ran in the first place, because I wanted to try to bump this tribe in a new direction, and I believe I did that. That is going to have a significant impact on the budget in the future, and it's going to be tough. Archambault: It was of huge significance, especially for environmental justice, because when you look at these infrastructure projects, you have to take a look at the route, and when you look at the route, it follows the highest areas of poverty, and in this nation, the highest areas of poverty are Indian Country. The 10 poorest counties of this nation, over half of them are tribal nations. What tribes are doing is saying, we have value, we have worth, we're still here, and that is exercising your sovereignty. The protests drew supporters from across the country, including many from Native American tribes and veterans groups. One group marched to the site of a sacred burial ground that was disturbed by bulldozers building the Dakota Access Pipeline. Archambault: If this country continues to encroach and continues to threaten our land rights and human rights, something is going to give, where there is going to have to be another movement. I can't tell you what that movement is. I couldn't tell you Standing Rock was going to happen, so I can't tell you what the next fight is going to be, but I know that if this country continues to treat a population the way it has, not just recently but the past 200 years, something has to happen. Archambault: If there is a way that I can assist anybody that came and helped us, I want to be able to do that, to find ways to help other tribes. I'm still exploring and looking at different options, trying to assess what would be best for me, and what would be best for my family. If my help is welcome, I will do what I can. Obama blocked the Dakota Access Pipeline almost a year ago, but the Trump administration waved it through."}, {"URL": "http://www.indianz.com/News/2016/12/02/brandon-ecoffey-media-gets-it-wrong-on-d.asp", "Timestamp": "20180918230638", "Sentences": "Although I have largely been skeptical of the mainstream media for most of my life, I never fathomed that it could be as inaccurate as it has been when it comes to reporting on topics surrounding the Dakota Access Pipeline. On Sunday night, November 21, millions around the world watched live online as police from all over the country attempted to freeze water protectors in Cannon Ball. Live feeds from independent journalists and private citizens documented law enforcement spraying individuals with water, tear gas, percussion grenades and rubber bullets in below freezing weather. The use of water as a weapon on unarmed people in freezing weather can only be described as a form of torture. It is likely that one water protector will forced to have a limb amputated after police threw the percussion grenades into the crowd. Sadly, the documented evidence from the night in question shows the opposite. Individuals were drenched with water in what can only be described as an attempt by law enforcement to inflict harm on private citizens. After the law enforcement finally ran out of ammunition the people would go and use the newly created ice slopes to sled on. Our people have always been resilient in the face of oppression. As someone who has worked in the media for a number of years it is disturbing that certain North Dakota based news agencies have become little more than the P.R. branch of the Morton County Sheriff's office. Despite the presence of overwhelming evidence that police are initiating and escalating conflicts with water protectors, the North Dakota media still prints the quotes of dishonest state officials without question. Visit the Lakota Country Times and subscribe today In South Dakota the same thing occurs regularly. The efforts by the non-Native media to push forth the state's bogus GearUp narrative is a perfect example. Some people in this business would prefer to be in the good graces of those in power instead of actually working to put forth objective facts. In fifty years the world will look back in what has taken place in Cannon Ball and it will understand why our people fought the corporations over water. In fifty years those who have not understood just how sacred and necessary this element is will begin to feel the pinch of a limited water supply. We only wish that they would reach this understanding before it is too late.

Then, we used that shape for the outline of our art project every November; the Thanksgiving turkey. My bad. The irony is overwhelming. The hypocrisy, unfathomable. I try to imagine how two generations from now will view our existence. I imagine high school students reading how, during the Thanksgiving festivities nationwide, authorities were using water cannons on indigenous people on indigenous land in order to break yet another treaty. I fathom the single, raised eyebrow on the countenance of a teenager who has a sudden epiphany concerning how full of shit this nation has been. I am forty-six years young. In my lifetime, I once enjoyed summer. I remember how cool we managed to stay because drinking water was so easily accessible. That easy. It was hilarious. My mother wiped tears away and cackled as I shook my head at the absolute absurdity. It was an aroma that signified summer fun and the absence of homework. It meant I survived another school year and managed to get permission to head out with friends to the community pool. Now, the nostalgic perfume filled my drinking glass and closed my throat at the sudden thought of drowning. I smelled bleach in my shower. First, water was being purchased by the gallon. Then, came the individual bottles. Restaurants began offering bottled water (to those who could afford expensive meals). Water. Real, drinkable water; odorless, tasteless, pure, sold cheap. I recall a man flicking a lighter under the gaping mouth of his kitchen faucet, turning the knob slightly, and as if witchcraft, a torch poured downward from where lips should easily ease onto a smooth shapeless stick of welcoming water. Then, there was a clarity problem in Wyoming, Montana, Pennsylvania, and other states. People began to talk about how fracking may be interfering with water supplies, causing dark coloration in drinking water. I too am guilty of living in distorted patriotic faith; our government would never sacrifice its own citizens, simultaneously pandering to corporations. I mean, not over water. I live in Virginia. And by drinkable I do not suggest it tastes enjoyable. This sounds impossible to me; not that I have these dilemmas over a natural resource, but that this is truly a high-class problem should one compare it to what Flint, Michigan, residents are still experiencing since state corruption and corporate greed has signed the death warrant on children who have been diagnosed with lead poisoning there. People are dying from their water. It is two days after Thanksgiving. The leftovers impregnate most of our refrigerators and freezers. We stroll malls and sit in cafes. We move in and out of establishments and grow thirsty. We stop somewhere and grab bottled water. We grab, and pay for, water without confrontation. On the Standing Rock Reservation, people are navigating water cannons and rubber bullets, dogs with bloodstained grimaces and militarized companies who serve billionaires, while our President, while our televised news media, shove their heads in the clouds for the sake of paychecks and allegiances to corporations. We are at this point watching indigenous people being thrown off their land, seeing their sacred burial grounds dug up for an oil pipeline because the original path for the pipeline was argued against by white people who understood the impending risk to their water. So, the path was simply changed, through a reservation, and the indigenous are expected (again) to just move, get out of the way. This is what wealthy white people want. And so it goes. The sun will abandon the water protectors soon. The water cannons will continue through the night. Hypothermia will be suffered. This bio-political move to keep the protest off of news outlets in order to let the Sioux, and their sibling tribes, die there without so much as a whisper from anyone who sees journalistic integrity in the mirror. And every object I purchase for Christmas supports this government. Every teeth-gleamed smile at decorations is me ignoring an atrocity. This will surely make room for a steel trail of black tears straight to Texas. But the truth is, I still find it difficult to swallow the reality: people will kill themselves and anyone in their way for profit. Tomorrow, in D.C., there is a march from the Department of Justice building to the White House. It begins at noon.

On behalf of the Episcopal Church, I offer my gratitude to President Barack Obama and his Administration for championing the rights of the indigenous peoples of the United States. We applaud the decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to deny the pipeline permit under Lake Oahe. I personally offer thanks to all those who have worked to amplify the voices of the people at Standing Rock, calling our attention to historic wrongs and injustices, and urging us all to consider a new vision for how we might love God, love each other and love creation. I am equally appreciative of the sacrifice and example of the military veterans, interfaith clergy and trauma chaplains who accompanied the Water Protectors during critical moments of the struggle. Even as our Church celebrates this historic announcement, we must also look to the mighty tasks that lay ahead. In the next eighteen months, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will conduct an Environmental Impact Statement to explore alternative routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline. We ask that the assessment involve extensive consultation with affected populations, and that any plan going forward honor treaty obligations with the Standing Rock Sioux. We will also continue to urge the current and incoming presidential administration to launch a thorough Department of Justice investigation into the use of brutal force by law enforcement on Standing Rock. Our work is not over, and the Episcopal Church has a critical role to play in ensuring a just and humane outcome is fully realized. We recognize that this struggle for the protection of water and of the basic human rights of indigenous people is one moment in a wider movement for social and environmental justice. He is a clergyman, not a scientist. I rather doubt that. He is ultimately just weighing in politically.

Beth Ramsay says: December 5, 2016 at 5:42 pm Please refer to him with politeness using a proper title. You may not agree with him, but this gentle man is the leader of a church denomination and deserves to referred to by Bishop Curry.

Wanda Valentine says: December 6, 2016 at 12:33 am Amen Jo Carson says: December 5, 2016 at 9:27 pm Well, as our Advent season has begun, our Episcopal priest has been very clear in the message of love for all. Just this second Sunday of Advent (Peace), we were challenged to reach out to all and support them as fellow humans. We feed the hungry and work to house the homeless. Social justice is about how much love for our fellow man we can muster. Politics is a worthy endeavor. Our church has been involved in the very foundations of this country. Mary Hennessy says: December 5, 2016 at 10:47 pm Defense of basic human rights is not political. It is a moral obligation. Jean Paveglio says: December 5, 2016 at 11:55 pm Water is sacred, and whether you are atheist, Roman Catholic, Jewish, Indian you should speak out about clean water for every living person. This is not a political issue nor is it a religious issue, it is an issue of the survival of the human race and of the planet. Jane Maslanka says: December 6, 2016 at 8:01 pm Sir, by your logic, Dr. Martin Luther King, Bishop Desmond Tutu, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer had no business getting involved in politics.

Alan Justice says: December 5, 2016 at 5:05 pm As a citizen, PB Curry has every right to speak his mind. As the leader of the Episcopal Church, he has the duty to advocate for justice, economic and otherwise. That is entirely within the realm of the Episcopal mission. M. J. Wise says: December 5, 2016 at 5:09 pm Someone should let the PB know that there is a major administration change not even 2 months away. I refuse to believe he is so naive. For a church that pride itself as holding scripture, tradition, and reason with equal regard, this PB appears to only have two colors of crayons to work with. M. J. Wise says: December 5, 2016 at 5:42 pm No, good and evil. One side he has declared good, and the other side he has declared to be evil. This is a human justice issue. This is Moses telling Pharaoh let my people go. This is those in power speaking for those without power. This is about a nation which continues to commit crimes against the indigenous people of this land and saying no more. This is the job of all Christians to stand up for the oppressed and as the leader of the Episcopal Church in this country this is very much his role. Speaking out against greed is what the one whom we follow did and this is an issue of greed. Jack Hanstein says: December 5, 2016 at 5:16 pm Thank you Bishop, and we stand with you as this process unfolds. He pointed out that there are, as he put it, mighty tasks that lie ahead. I stand with him in celebration, and with a vigilant eye to the future. To the police seeing that vandalism be kept to a minimum, the P.B. does not see the damaged expensive vehicles. Tough luck To the people of the area communities who had to pay in their taxes for the law enforcement deployment Tough luck To the World War 2 veterans whose Monument in Washington DC was defaced by supporters of this movement. Our Episcopal Church Anything but fair or balanced. Finally for the deputy sheriff who was fired on 3 times with a 38 pistol, Tough luck Rob Neville says: December 5, 2016 at 10:06 pm To the people of Illinois: If you think this pipeline was for your benefit you are sorely mistaken. This is so the companies that want to refine the oil can bring it to market and the refineries cheaper so they can make more profit. Oil prices are global not local. This is a power play by those who already have more than they could ever need or want taking more and getting the poor to fight the poor to protect their profits. They get tax write offs too in the way of oil depletion allowances. The electricity has to be generated from some source, most likely coal or natural gas or hydroelectric power. Rebecca C.

Priscilla Johnstone says: December 5, 2016 at 7:32 pm Proud of our church and our PB that stood with Native Americans who have been and in this case clearly were disenfranchised by the powers of influence and money. Easy to overlook and ignore the people of Flint and the Standing Rock people: Not in my backyard, not my problem. Glad that we are following the Jesus movement by speaking out, supporting, praying, feeding the dispossessed and that we are also inviting a more peaceful and enlightened response by those in power. There is only the post-truth promulgated by social media, news media, and people who are jumping on the most recent bandwagon. Ignoring or distorting facts is widespread in this country. There is too much real injustice in the world that needs to be focused on and that is where we can truly make a positive difference. Thea Brown says: December 5, 2016 at 8:43 pm Some of the negative comments here are both astounding and disappointing. I think this is the time when we all must stand up and be counted. I am glad that he is leading by example in this way. Marybeth Wright says: December 5, 2016 at 8:50 pm Thank you so very much PB Curry. PB Curry is expressing his views and not those of us who do not agree. protecting water supplies and sacred ground are human issues that were politicized for the sake of profit. That book is a great help in understanding a sizable portion of our population and knowing how to respond to them. John Jennings says: December 5, 2016 at 10:27 pm Proud of our faith and our Episcopal leadership. Thank you, Bishop Curry. Barbara Harber says: December 5, 2016 at 10:28 pm Whether I agree or disagree with the position taken, the church must reclaim its rightful place as city, community, national voice on issues vital to the people. Maybe not from the Sunday pulpit, but on the Monday street corner. Sandy Cooke says: December 5, 2016 at 11:11 pm Thank you, Bishop Curry, for all that you do. Linda Light says: December 6, 2016 at 12:23 am Bishop Curry, You ask that there be extensive consultation and decisions made in the future for the pipeline be in keeping with the current Treaties. There were representatives from the court and the Corp of Engineers who even went to a meeting scheduled around tribal leadership meetings so as to be convenient for the tribal leaders to attend right at their own meeting location and the tribal leaders adjourned and would not even meet with the representatives. The Sioux blew off the whole issue when they might have stopped this using appropriate channels. The Sioux simply threw a giant tantrum when it was too late to go thru appropriate channels. It sure looks like they wanted a reason to cause a ruckus. I understand that you need to support the North Dakota Epicopalians who chose to side with protestors. There are Episcopalians in the Corp of Engineers, too. The Sioux Tribe failed in their responsibility to provide feed back. Your statements imply that the Corps of Engineers did not do an honest job in their impact study and that they allowed treaty violations and destruction of burial grounds. That is untrue. It would be nice if you could also demonstrate by what you say that you have actually looked at both sides of an issue rather than saying statements that make you sound like you did not educate yourself about both sides of this issue. It would also be nice if you refrained from praising people who endangered others because they would rather make a ruckus than even attempt to use the channels in place. Had they used the channels in place, perhaps all the time and effort they spent protesting could have been put to a constructive use. He lifts me up. Grateful to have his lead to follow.

The Bishops are Ojibwe tribe members, whose ancestral land is flooded by the building of the dam. Rachel Clayborne, the great-granddaughter of the dam builder, is the protagonist of the novel. In one passage, he recounts the number of deaths and catastrophes associated with dam failures. The novel urges us to look away from profit and think instead of the people who live in these areas and of the land we all inhabit. His deployment unravels their relationship and Rachel moves on, earning an environmental studies degree and marrying an indigenous studies scholar. A pivotal, emotional scene unfolds the night before Joe leaves for the war. To him, this is defeat. That changed with the ongoing battle over the Dakota Access Pipeline, the proposed 1,172-mile pipeline that will transport approximately 470,000 barrels of crude oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois. It is still worth noting that the pipeline, and projects like it, threaten the sovereignty of tribal nations, which are federally recognized as independent from the United States. It also jeopardizes their ability to protect their sacred land and water. The Army Corps of Engineers used a general nationwide Permit 12 that does not address Native American sacred sites, climate, or environmental impact. As the Dakota Access Pipeline Project reminded us, the United States has a long, unsavory history of deceiving Native American people. Hassinger could have rehashed this well-known saga, but she digs below the surface, uncovering the often-complex circumstances and agreements that lead to exchanges of land. They are forced to return to the land as caretakers rather than owners, guests to the man who destroyed their community. The families are bound together by their shared history and the land they both live on. An even more telling scene takes place when Rachel is in her 20s. She visits the dam as a newlywed, with her husband Michael. She can immediately recognize how it has obliterated traditional ways of indigenous peoples and, while personally owning the wrong she believes her great-grandfather committed, Rachel suggests blowing it up. Throughout After the Dam, the exchanges between Michael and Rachel illustrate how the academic world, which encourages dispassion and objectivity, can cripple the emotions that drive us to action. Tribal members consider it sacred."}, {"URL": "http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Pipeline-protesters-shut-down-northbound-lanes-of-10925871.php", "Timestamp": "20180919002346", "Sentences": "Possible causes: The address was entered incorrectly The item no longer exists There has been an error on the site If you feel the address you entered is correct you can contact us, mentioning the error message received and the item you were trying to reach.

As Gilbertt repeatedly noted, it was the water protectors who snuffed several fires which erupted after police fired tear gas cannons. While the activists worked quickly to put out the fires, police ignored their efforts and proceeded to inundate them in below freezing temperatures. According to Gilbertt and other witnesses, those trapped on the bridge had no means to escape the barrage of rubber bullets, water, LRAD sound cannons, tear gas, and mace. In live video, the sound of rubber bullets being shot occasionally punctuate the obviously chaotic and desperate situation.

The caption with the post read as follows. These women were told that they could not wear their water protector flags pinned to their clothes at the National Museum of the American Indian in DC. They put their water protector flags back on and were fine after that. In the video, Varela states that they came to the museum for lunch after a closing ceremony at the tipi camp.

Some 300 people were hurt after being hit by either water, gas, grenade or rubber bullet. An estimated 27 needed hospital treatment. Reports from legal observers suggest that several people were unconscious having been hit by rubber bullets. There were so many casualties that the local school gymnasium had to be opened for emergency relief. There are graphic photos online of serious injuries incurred by the protectors.

They must be vanquished from the camps and the natives must stand up and carry the fight. ALL anti-American traitors and they should all be treated as such. This is not a peaceful protest. The Standing Rock people have asked the out of state rioters to leave. They have brought this to a riot. The people of the area have been threatened to the point that they send their children to live elsewhere, farm animals have been shot with arrows and guns. Latest count over 100. They chased buffalo until some died from exhaustion, they use sling shots to shoot rocks and anything thry find at law enforcement. They build baracades on the highways so emergency vehicles and any others can not go through. When asked to move it they start it on fire. One place is on a bridge where all this you write about happens. They burned tires cars and military vehicles on that bridge making it dangerous to use. ThE barbwire is to keep the from going to construction equipment so they can drain fuel onto the ground and burn the equipment. Yea water protectors. They have come to town and protested by grade schools scaring small children. This will forever scar the children. They poured oil on our capital building. So until you have been here and witnessed this you have no voice. Sad they have hurt the relations between Standing Rock and North Dakota people for years to come. Many of the protesters, other than some of the Natives including the elders, have not been peaceful at all. Most of us locals, including the Natives, just want all the protesters to leave so we can handle this in a civil manner. This article is beyond ridiculous. mary says: March 7, 2017 at 11:55 am you people are mad,after you lie to each other enough you seem to believe it.

I am appalled at what has happened the past few days in Standing Rock, with the expulsion of the water protectors and the arrest of those who stayed. The writing was on the wall the instant then-President Obama broke the momentum of the struggle by giving those fighting the Dakota Access Pipeline and their supporters the fleeting, ephemeral victory of a temporary halt by an easily reversible executive order. All to make way for the black snake to carry fuel for out-dated technology that is destroying the planet, both by aggravating climate change and by poisoning the land with leaks and spills which are inevitable given the utter lack of interest in preserving infrastructure clearly evident in nearly every part of America. Water is life, and native lives matter. And now to the NHS. It will provide you with all medical, dental, or nursing care. Everyone, rich or poor, man or woman, or child can use it or any part of it. There are no charges, except for a few special items. There are no insurance qualifications. But it is not a charity. Among them, however, he quoted Margaret Thatcher saying that NHS was a given; that no politician in the UK would ever think of touching NHS, or the social welfare support system in general. He added that if that ever happened, there would be a revolution. What I saw of NHS in the film, which also featured the systems in Canada, France, and Cuba, filled me with envy. And then medicine. For an American, it was like a fairy-tale. Your health, your safety, and your freedom depend on saving it. Go out into the streets and make yourselves heard. Deluge your MPs with phone calls, letters, emails. Campaign street to street, door to door. March, chant, scream. Hold up the American system as the example of what your life will become without NHS and declare that you deserve better. Because you do. In fact, we all do, every person on the planet. Saving the NHS can be a first step to taking back power from the market-place and putting it back into the hands of the people. Into your hands. Fight for yourselves. Fight for your friends, family, neighbors, compatriots, and guests in your country. Fight in the name of the water protectors driven from their camps by storm-troopers serving the minions of the wealthy and powerful few. Fight for all of us. Fight for me. Thig ar latha, our day will come. Keep the faith. Peace out. By religion I am a freethinking Broad Church Episcopalian. By politics I am a Marxist. After a lifetime of trying to cram my square self into too many round holes, I've finally surrendered to my desire to write. Whether I can make a living out of it has yet to be seen.

You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. The standoff to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a fever pitch, and this may be our last chance to halt construction before Donald Trump takes office. Militarized law enforcement and private security firms are harassing, assaulting and jailing hundreds of non-violent protesters who are fighting for indigenous rights and to curb climate change. They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline.

This did little to prevent a rapid escalation on the part of the authorities. Though the spiritual ceremonies continued throughout the night around a small fire lit to warm the natives and their allies as temperatures dropped well below freezing, the sound of screams quickly drowned out the prayers. Although authorities claimed water cannons were only used to put out fires set by protestors, the one small fire on the road was well out of the way of the barricade, and the other, where medics treated the residents of Oceti Sakowin who had no access to hot running water or medical facilities, was separated from the melee by a valley running along the road. Amid allegations that aggressive protesters were attempting to attack the law enforcement line, hundreds of unarmed people were successively tear-gassed and blasted with high pressure water hoses. As the night wore on, ice from the water canons enveloped the barbed wire and glistened under the floodlights. Helicopters circled ominously overhead, and from the hill which sloped away from the road the red lights of police cars grew increasingly numerous. In spite of the hostility, the water defenders continued to hold their ground, in an attempt to communicate their message to those who opposed them. Others close to the barricade chanted into loudspeakers, hoping to reach the people on the other side. You are protecting oil and we are protecting you.

Jeremy Corbyn: Lovely to see you. There was a big swing to Labour, but not quite enough, unfortunately, to give us a Parliamentary majority. And a huge degree of uncertainty by the right and by the Conservatives. Look at each other. You have different backgrounds, languages. Different ethnic communities. JC: The picture of the world is a crucial one. It is about what we do to deal with issues of injustice and inequality and poverty, and above all, hope and opportunity for young people. Hope that they can get to college or university, opportunity they can get a decent job. I want a foreign policy based on human rights, based on respect for international law, based for recognizing the causes of the refugee flows, the causes of the injustice around the world. And indeed, there were some awful events during the election campaign. Before the election started there was an attack on Westminster itself and on Parliament. There was then the dreadful bomb in Manchester. And then there was an attack in London on London Bridge. NK: And you committed kind of political heresy because you talked about some of the root causes. Yet that resonated with people. I was just saying, if you go to war in Iraq and you destabilize the whole country, there are consequences. But we do know that Donald Trump fully intends to take advantage of any crisis to push forward this incredibly regressive, xenophobic agenda, because he tried to exploit the Manchester attacks to say this is about immigrants flowing across our borders. He tried to take advantage of the London Bridge attack to say this is why we need to Muslim ban. People were extremely angry at the language he used toward Sadiq Khan, who is, after all, elected mayor of the city. I was also appalled at the language he used surrounding the Paris Climate Change discussions. I mean, these are serious, serious global issues. And he seemed to think this was an opportunity for promoting polluting industries. NK: Well, he actually said he was going to negotiate a better deal. But having worked, like you have, for a very long time on these issues, the fact that finally India and China, in a formal setting, came onboard with the idea there are limits to emissions, there are limits to pollution, there are limits to what you can do. For the USA having come onboard under Obama, then walking away under Trump, is beyond sad. And we are seeing examples of that. And internationally I think we can see the same thing as well. JC: I think that the image of the USA is too often presented as the image of what Donald Trump has said day-to-day, whereas the reality, look at the number of jobs in renewables in California alone runs into the hundreds of thousands. Look at the growth of renewable energy systems across the USA, the number of states and cities that are serious about protecting their environment and controlling what they can of climate change. NK: I want to talk a little bit about the way some of my friends in the United States are feeling right now, who were very inspired by this election campaign and by your leadership bid within the Labour Party. I have to tell you that people are feeling a little discouraged right now in the United States. I was half asleep watching something on television. And Bernie comes on to say, well done on the campaign, and I was interested in your campaigning ideas. And I said, well, you, actually. They want to do things collectively. And we gained the support and participation of a very large number of people. I wish we had. NK: But you did win the leadership of the Labour Party. You knock on doors and you identify voters. Just think, those people that were campaigning for social justice in Chicago in the 1920s, the best they could do was print their own newspaper if they could afford it, or make a leaflet and take it round and hand it out on bread queues. I grew up in the era when you used to print your own leaflets and go and give them out. You can now send out something on social media, and you can reach potentially millions of people in five minutes. The opportunities are there. William Randolph Hearst would have hated the Internet. NK: It seems to me that you have received just about as bad media treatment, smears from elite media, as is possible to receive. In fact, it seems to have backlashed and contributed to this feeling of loss of faith in many of these elite institutions. After a while, a high degree of media abuse makes you a figure of interest. And the way in which this horrific event has been interpreted, it seems, throughout British society, is as extreme evidence of a failed system that does not value human life, that puts kind of a hierarchy on life. JC: What it exposed was something about modern urban living. This is the borough in London that is the richest in the whole country. Very, very rich borough. And its council gave a rebate to the top taxpayers last year. Gave them a little gift. NK: Money back. Some flats had been bought independently, and they were sub-tenanted or sub-sub-tenanted. Nobody really knew who was in the block. The whole system collapsed. And so the debate has turned full circle on this. But people are frightened. And you know, these questions are just completely heartbreaking. Wars were started in the name of that attack. And here we are in a time of overlapping crisis. Climate change is one of those crises, and inequality is another, and racial injustice is another. JC: Well, climate change and refugees are linked. Climate change and war is linked. Environmental disaster, not necessarily always associated with climate change, is also linked when you have deforestation and you end up destroying your local environment because of it. And so, if you look at the war in Darfur, look at the refugee flows into Libya, partly from the war in Syria, also from human rights abuses across the whole region. Also from people who have been driven off their land in sub-Saharan Africa to make way for often very large corporations buying up land to grow various crops, often rice or fruit, to export somewhere else, leaving the local population unemployed and hungry. There is a connection about the need for supporting the living and development rights of everybody, not just yourself at their expense. JC: There was a gentleman who came to our rally in Hastings, which is south coast seaside resort fishing town. He was aged 91. He joined the Labour Party in 1945, been a party member ever since then. Very active all his life. And he said this was the most hopeful time of his life. And his grandfather had been in the Chartists in the 1850s, which helped bring about some degree of democracy in Britain. We were characterized as an election campaign that was full of young, idealistic people. Yeah, there were a lot of young people there, and many of them with brilliant ideals and brilliant imagination. It was a coming together of large numbers of people. JC: Thank you very much.

Enbridge Line 5 is a 60-year-old oil pipeline which carries half a million barrels of oil a day from western Canada to eastern Canada via the Great Lakes states. There are public concerns about the risk of an oil spill in the Straits of Mackinac. There was an oil spill involving Line 5 at Crystal Falls, Michigan, in 1999.

As a quick background to the story, this issue revolves around a pipeline being built by Energy Transfer Partners which is due to transport oil from North Dakota to Illinois daily. It intends to travel underneath the Missouri River which is the main water source for the Sioux tribe. Beyond the risks of their water supply becoming contaminated, the tribe also argues that the pipe interferes with sacred grounds which belong to them as Native Americans according to agreements known as the Fort Laramie treaties. The Sioux claim that the federal government didn't do enough to involve them while seeking a permit for the pipeline, a matter which would defy federal law. Over the past few months, thousands of protestors have descended upon the site, setting up camp on land owned by Energy Transfer Partners. Increasing reports of clashes with policemen circulate on social media, as the issue gains more international momentum and the winter weather conditions worsen. Anyone who remains onsite after December 5 will be deemed an illegal trespasser. So far journalists covering the protests have been arrested, protestors have been shot with rubber bullets and 300 people have been treated for injuries, while there are allegations that concussion grenades and water canons have been used to control crowds. British artist Kate Nash, who uprooted her life from London to LA two years ago, has been particularly vocal in the days and weeks following Donald Trump's Election, and is now turning her efforts towards this heated issue. Kate has always had a political streak, appearing on BBC News to defend Russian punk band Pussy Riot when they were deemed guilty for protesting the Russian Orthodox Church's support of President Putin in 2012. She founded a female collective called Girl Gang, intended as a positive, feminist movement to rally and support women in the arts. She took to the streets of Downtown LA immediately after Trump's Election alongside thousands of others, posting Instagrams to document the scenes. Kate was concerned about the lack of media coverage, revealing that many of her fans back in the UK didn't even know anything was going on. Over the weekend she drafted a letter, addressed it to President Obama, Army Corps of Engineers, and the Department of Justice, and is now asking artists and members of the music industry to sign it in a bid to hold America to account in these increasingly nefarious post-Trump political times. Even if we don't make a difference, I want America to feel watched. Kate's letter appears below with signatures so far from Billie Joe Armstrong, Tegan & Sara, Karen O, Hayley Williams of Paramore, Shirley Manson, Moby, Mark Ronson, Vic Mensa, Pussy Riot, Cat Power, Maroon 5, Ben Gibbard from Death Cab for Cutie, and many, many more. Kate would also like to direct you to two additional sites if you're a member of the public looking to support the cause. Sacred Stone Camp allows you to donate directly to the camp at Standing Rock and contribute to the legal fund. You can also order supplies from Amazon via the site to send to those camping.

Dear President Obama, Army Corps of Engineers, and Department of Justice, We are writing to express our shock at the treatment of the people of Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. We are deeply disturbed by the police actions that have been taking place, where non violent protests have been and continue to be met with extremely aggressive tactics including; being shot with water canons in below freezing temperatures, chemical weapons, rubber bullets, and attack dogs. These are the same inhumane methods used during WWII and the Civil Rights Movement. We feel strongly in the current political climate that those in power must be held accountable for their actions. We encourage you to remember that this planet provides for us, not the other way around. Water is life and this cannot be underestimated or taken for granted in 2016. We are aware of the long and painful history between the US and its indigenous people. Know that the world's eyes and the eyes of the music community are on you now as you continue to disregard the treaties you have with the Native American people and act barbarically towards them. Standing Rock we stand with you. Kate Nash: Music has to be political. This is a time for taking a stance and not just showing off about being rich. Look at what's happening to the world and what's already happened, the stuff we've ignored for years. Take the Leonardo DiCaprio documentary Before The Flood. When I saw that I thought, in 40 years it's going to be so difficult to survive. And these issues are connected. The North Dakota Pipeline is part of it because the Indigenous People are connected to the land and respect the planet. It's important for us to learn from them. Why is it important as a UK musician to rally behind this. The importance is two-fold. America affects the entire globe culturally, financially and politically. Secondly, the story has been suppressed. Even in America the media aren't reporting on it enough. Coverage of American issues around the globe is important at this time. Donald Trump is to become President, people connected to Trump are Heiling in meetings, there's a normalization of white supremacists. It's a very important time for us to be holding America to account for its power and the promises it makes. We should have an opinion and a voice wherever we are. People's rights have already been threatened. It sounds dramatic but these are the facts. Stand up for little people who are being crushed by big bullies. Let's talk about the letter. I stand against the violence towards people. People have said they're not going to move by December 5th and my main concern is that lives are going to be taken. People are very injured, they're subjected to freezing conditions, and any barbaric treatment has to stop. We all have the right to peacefully protest and these people have the right to protect land that was promised to them. I'm also urging a repeal. I saw it on Instagram at first. I've been seeing more and more social activism there. I had a lack of knowledge about the Native American people. It's not a history I'd ever studied as a British person so I had no understanding of it. I'd like to shed light on it for the UK. It's important in breaking down the perspective we have of America, particularly with this new leader coming into power. Learning from history is key. I remember growing up with music and activism always being integrated together. Whether it was John Lennon, Nirvana, Kathleen Hanna, Patti Smith, or Freddie Mercury, my favorite musicians have always stood up for things. As an artist you have a platform and you are a leader. In 2016 it's more important than ever to use your voice. I want to help us be part of a brighter, more positive future and I would urge other musicians to look to their heroes and hear their voices.

And many people have been sharing their thoughts on that over social and traditional media, over dinner conversations, at the office and on the bus with complete strangers. And, as expected, people are all over the map with ideas and strategies. Hatred, division and ignorance has escalated, so it is only natural that our response to it has to escalate along with it to match its intensity. While I certainly empathize with the emotions driving that idea, we also have to remember that it is violence that got us here. If we choose to be motivated by anger and hatred, if we choose to divide our communities even more, all we do is continue to feed the exact energy that got us Trump. Even if the anger is towards Trump and his supporters, we are empowering the forces that allowed him to rise to power. We need to be angry, but at the forces of injustice, not its human participants. Violence breeds patriarchy, which is at the root of so much of the violence in our society. Once you introduce violence to the equation, you limit those who can be on the front lines and those who can lead. Mostly, you limit it to young able-bodied men. And look where that has gotten us as a society. We also know, however, that simply getting millions of people out into the streets by itself is not enough. King called for a movement that was just as attention-grabbing and disruptive as a riot. As a society, we have studied violence for centuries. We have not studied nonviolence. We do not know what it means or how to use it effectively. We have never given it a real chance, despite the evidence that is out there. We have not invested in it the same way we have with violence. There is nothing radical about violence. There is nothing revolutionary about a force that has destroyed communities forever, a force that we are all too familiar with and a force that got us into this mess. What is radical and revolutionary is using a tool that is new. You are not addressing the root cause. Violence is the enemy. That idea that we can use force, fear and intimidation to get what we want, to force our will, is what needs to change, not the faces that are in power. Voting was never going to give us the changes that we need in the first place. We need to organize harder than ever, not just in electoral politics, but in the spaces of social movements. Those are the scapegoats that Trump used to drum up fear. There is real concern about insecurity, of not being able to take care of their families, of an uncertain future, of our values being threatened. This is not about empathizing with the oppressor out of charity. It is about gathering information and understanding the dynamic of the conflict. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. We need to take care of ourselves, physically, emotionally, and spiritually, because we have a tough road ahead. With all the forces trying to destroy us, staying healthy is an act of resistance. Honoring ourselves, fighting the internal violence that is so often self-inflicted, telling ourselves that we matter and treating ourselves accordingly is revolutionary. But I choose to be happy instead of miserable. So today, I choose to be inspired. I choose to be motivated. I choose to be committed. I choose to cultivate joy. I choose love over hate. We actually need to feel them to the fullest degree. I have real fear for people I love who live in Trumpland. But the best way to protect those we love is to win over those who hate them. Love can be sweet and sympathetic, but it can also be aggressive and assertive. It is that type of love that we need moving forward. I will feel that anger, but I refuse to feel desperate, hopeless or apathetic. Those are acts of violence that we do to our own soul, and it is violence that got us to where we are today. Instead, I will organize harder, protest harder, build harder, train harder, and love harder than I ever have before.

Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger The Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency responsible for investigating, developing and maintaining water and related environmental resources, recently announced that they would not allow the Dakota Access pipeline to be constructed under the Missouri River and through Lakota territory. Hundreds of tribes came together in a display of tribal unity not seen in hundreds of years. Thousands of people, both those within Native American communities and their non-Native allies, felt called to go to Standing Rock. As a Native American scholar of environmental history and religion, I believe that for most individuals who gathered at the site, it was a modern-day pilgrimage. Their answer was twofold. Individuals on a pilgrimage usually have these experiences both while traveling to certain places of transcendence and while at those sacred places. Joe Brusky, CC BY-NC Lakota scholar Philip Deloria, has also described how the transformative experience of Native American sacred places provides meaning and personal growth for individuals who journey to be in their presence. My cousin Renee LaPier and her daughter Modesta LaPier, for example, journeyed 2,600 miles to and from Standing Rock. And once at the site, they encountered a transformative experience. Going on a pilgrimage. Joe Brusky, CC BY-NC Modern-day pilgrimage It is not just Native Americans who have gone to Standing Rock. On Dec. 5 an estimated 2,000 U.S. veterans, both Native American and their non-Native allies, made their pilgrimage to Standing Rock in a freezing blizzard. They came from across the U.S. and other parts of the world; they represented American veterans from many conflicts and wars, including older Korean and Vietnam vets and younger Iraqi vets. She explains how they are blending their individual religious ideas and political activism into a new form of religious expression. Many Native Americans and non-Native allies viewed going to Standing Rock as a pilgrimage. I have read hundreds of social media posts of people who were drawn to go there as a spiritual quest, reflecting on how the experience changed their sense of identity, gave meaning to their lives, provided a sense of community and transformed them forever. I believe a modern kind of pilgrimage for Native Americans is emerging in which people travel to sites of collective action as a form of religious practice. It is true that some come for personal goals of spiritual awakening and some to journey to a sacred place. And, there are others who undertake a spiritual journey to find community, and purpose.

I am also a proud member of the International Network of Indigenous Women of the Americas. It tells you a lot of about the indigenous paradigm. What you plant there, how you treat it. To me being a Water Protector is like being an advocate for something that has sort of lost its voice, which would be the water. It brings up some feelings of trauma. I think that it echoes that colonial violence that continues to exist in our world right now, in our experience as indigenous people. I think with the whole idea of protecting the water in a peaceful sense, not in a confrontational sense, not in a confrontational sense, the whole peacekeeping water protection journey. Even my name, Shonto, is water. I think in this case it is people putting themselves between the sacred element of water and those that are planning on a possible destruction of it, or change, or fouling, desecration of it. A lot of people, the extent of their association with water is just turning on the tap. Know where it comes from and the life of it, and the possible pollution of it, that we all need water.

Donald Trump defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to become the 45th president of the United States. Yes, this is a poll, and polls are part of the reason we got into this mess in the first place. But polls still have some meaning, and the new one The Post cites should tell us a lot. Another recent poll, this one conducted by ABC News along with The Post, shows the Democratic advantage for the 2018 midterms narrowing to a dead heat among the most likely voters. As awful as Trump has been, and as near-total the chaos has been surrounding the Republican Party, the opposition has not been able to capitalize. In a divided country, Donald Trump makes perfect sense as a president. He does a fantastic job at keeping the civil war going, and the interest in ending that war for some time now has seemed limited to one or the other side hoping to capture the flag for a while. All we talk about is how much we hate Trump. If you want a million-ton dose of either, turn on MSNBC sometime. A Himalayan range of predictable messaging. And smart people watch it. All thought has been denuded in the past year. Despising Trump and his followers is easy. This country is broken. It is devastated by hate and distrust. What is needed is a massive effort at national reconciliation. It will have to be inspired, delicate and ingenious to work. Someone needs to come up with a positive vision for the entire country, one that is more about love and community than blame. That will probably mean abandoning the impulse to continually litigate the question of who is worse, Republicans or Democrats. As a progressive, this has never seemed to be a terribly difficult question for me to answer for myself. For some reason, though, people keep insisting that both the question and the answer must be included in any effort at punditry or any public political discussion, almost like a disclaimer, as if audiences might forget. It has become our version of a loyalty oath. When people are scared enough and full enough of hate, they will surrender their rights more quickly. This was made easier first because conservatives were convinced liberals were in league with terrorists, and more lately because progressives have been told Trump and his like are in league with Russians. Mutual hatred and fear has made us much more easily disenfranchised. We are on the brink of a kind of civil war, but even suggesting that this is an eventuality to be avoided is becoming almost treasonous in both camps. The people running the Democratic Party are opportunists and hacks, and for as long as the despicable and easily hated Trump is president, that is what these dopes will focus on, not realizing that most of the country is crying out for something different. Even making the country more funny would be a start. T-Day was exactly one year ago. It was an awful day, one of the worst ever for a lot of people.

Since the time of the violent attack, the police erected numerous concrete barricades to prevent people from accessing or crossing the bridge. Due to the attack, a tribal elder was put in critical condition, with another woman left permanently blind in one eye after being shot in the face with a tear gas canister. As we previously reported, during that attack the heavily militarized police began firing water cannons, flashbang grenades, tear gas, and rubber bullets on water protectors trapped on the bridge. Following a brief confrontation with police, in which military vehicles were reportedly set alight by provacateurs, and ultimately cleared from the roadway by water protectors, heavily armed police in riot gear kettled water protectors on a bridge and began brutalizing those trapped. The already spotty internet availability has also been cut by law enforcement repeatedly during similar clashes, likely in coordination with TigerSwan, the private military contractor coordinating intelligence at Standing Rock To now see the unity of water protectors and military veterans marching side-by-side to reclaim the bridge is not only a symbolic victory but a strategic one as well, as the bridge is the access point between the construction area and the camps. Make no mistake that the strategic de-escalation by pro-DAPL forces will not be accepted the water protectors, which is seen as exactly the sleight-of-hand move it is, and that the fight against the DAPL will continue. The easement denial was in many ways is an attempt to derail the growing protest movement as it reached critical mass with the arrival of thousands of veterans.

In short, when we hold the working class responsible for white supremacy, other whites are absolved of racial wrongdoing. Certainly, there is no apology for the racism of working-class whites, nor any excuse; but we should seek to understand the ways in which white supremacy and power are completely intertwined. White supremacy is most commonly conceptualized as a way for lower-class whites to feel socially superior to people from other ethnic backgrounds. More important, though, white supremacy is a tried-and-tested means for upper class whites to grow their wealth and power. It Was a White Revolt. They constantly are told that African-Americans are the primary recipients of welfare and social benefits, and that policies like affirmative action are greatly detrimental to all whites. By controlling key aspects of the economy, especially education, politics and the media, the white elite often very easily manipulate less affluent whites. First, by governing and managing the education system in this country, the upper classes remain in control of the equality of opportunity. Today, as Republicans continue slashing education funding at the federal, state and local levels, they legislate for ignorance. They fear statistics and facts, realizing what may follow the political enlightenment of the lower classes. Second, elite authority over the educational system also means regulation over the teaching of subjects like history, government and civics. An overwhelming majority of Americans have shockingly little understanding of our own past and our own government, often leading to lower-class political apathy. Finally, business owners and corporate leaders have historically sought to keep workers segregated, either physically or by job. Since antebellum times, masters attempted to engender racism between poor white laborers and enslaved blacks, trying to keep each side distrustful of the other. By perpetuating and encouraging a vile form of racism, they attempted to establish psychological segregation, ultimately thwarting the prospect of an interracial coalition. Thus, even though working-class whites certainly support Trump and his policies, it is important to remember why. With a few short breaths, Watson had laid bare the most important reason why white supremacy has always thrived in this country, especially during times of severe economic inequality. As our nation impetuously tumbles toward a very uncertain future, we must take heed that the racist rhetoric and divisive political issues have only just begun. The millionaires and billionaires of this country literally have a fortune to protect, and white supremacy has always helped assure their place at the apex of society.

A man found in the truck was ruled out by police as the driver at the time of the attack. He died as a result of the crash and was later identified as a Polish citizen. The Polish delivery company that owned the vehicle said it lost touch with the driver at 4pm local time after it left the country for Berlin. Owner Ariel Zurawki said he feared the vehicle, driven by his cousin, might have been hijacked. One doctor said operations would be going on through the night with many of the injured in a life-threatening state so off-duty doctors across Berlin were being brought in. A witness told the Guardian the truck hit the market at speed. The truck was going 40mph. She said it crashed into a stall only a few feet from where she and her friend were standing. About eight to 10 feet in front of us was where the lorry ploughed through. It ploughed through the stall where we bought our mulled wine. There is no road nearby. People crushed. I am safe. Everything went dark, it was black and there was screaming. Rushton said they did not know if the incident was over once the truck stopped, so they stayed still. Another witness, Mike Fox, told the Associated Press that the truck missed him by about three metres as it drove into the market, tearing through tables and market stalls. He said he helped people who appeared to have broken limbs and that others were trapped under Christmas stands. French authorities said that Lahouaiej-Bouhlel had been inspired by Isis propaganda but no evidence had been found that Isis orchestrated the attack.

Officers said the lorry came from the direction of Budapester Strasse, over the pavement, before coming to a halt by a Christmas tree in front of the church. Known locally as the jagged tooth, the church was bombed in the second world war, and left more or less in its ruined state as a memorial to the victims of the war. It is one of the most popular tourist sites in Berlin, and very close to the Berlin zoo. Police cleared the area and volunteers set up an information point for relatives looking for news of missing loved ones. The Christmas market was cleared and a police spokesman said there were concerns the crash might have caused a gas leak. Morgenpost newspaper posted a photograph online, showing damaged tables and stalls, and footage of a truck at the scene and police officers investigating. A lorry drove through the crowds of people.

Wednesday, February 8, 2017 The Real Reason President Trump has not received any Phone Calls regarding Dakota Access Pipeline I normally check my Twitter feed every morning to catch up on the latest news, opinions and events that happened throughout the night. This morning I saw a tweet by ABC News embedded with a video of President Trump responding to questions regarding the US Army Corps of Engineers announcement that they intended to approve the final easement and allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross the Missouri River less than a mile above the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. Usually, if I do something it's like bedlam. And you know, a lot of jobs, in the Keystone case we have potentially 32,000 jobs. Almost immediately. And then as you know I did the Dakota pipeline. And nobody called up to complain. Because it was unfair. Years of getting approvals. Nobody showed up to fight it. This company spends a tremendous, hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars and then all of a sudden people show up to fight it. That's not fair to our companies. This is the pipeline that has brought about one of the largest gathering of Native peoples in the history of the United States. Tens of thousands of people, from hundreds of tribes have stood in solidarity for months against the building of this pipeline. I did not know how many of us have actually CALLED Donald Trump's White House, but no halfway informed leader could legitimately say they have not heard voices of opposition. Especially the President of the United States. But I thought, OK. I'll do it his way. So I looked up the Contact the White House web page and found the comments phone number. I composed a re-tweet of the video with a comment imploring people to call the White House Comment line at 202-456-1111. If Donald Trump wanted to hear from us via phone calls, so be it. I clicked Tweet and then immediately picked up my phone to call the White House, voice my complaint and protest President Trump's support and approval of the Dakota Access Pipeline. He concludes that the lack of phone calls is proof that Dakota Access Pipeline is not controversial, companies are being treated unfairly, and everyone is going to be happy in the end with his decision to approve the pipeline. I hung up the phone and deleted my tweet. Our elders leading the resistance at Standing Rock are very wise. When confronting companies driven by greed, they have modeled that the best resistance begins with prayer, ceremony and standing in solidarity. I would apply this same model to confronting a narcissistic President who is surrounded by billionaires and insulated by alternate facts. Donald Trump has intentionally chosen not to hear our protests, but Creator will definitely hear our prayers. Resist in beauty my relatives. Water is life. You cannot drink oil. So I tried calling and, after waiting on hold for nearly 8 minutes, was able to get through and voice my opposition. I have no idea how long the line is open for or how consistent it is. But apparently it is occasionally open. :-) The number to call is 202-456-1111. Resist in beauty my relatives. Share to Twitter Share to Facebook Share to Pinterest 5 comments: Mark Charles said...

Hi Mark, after reading what you wrote here, I called the White House, too. I am so appalled at the lack of ability to communicate with this administration. Since the recording on that phone line suggested it, I went to the official White House Facebook page and sent a message. You commented officially that there were no phone calls of opposition to the Dakota pipeline. Since there is no way to make a phone call about the Dakota pipeline, I am officially voicing my extreme opposition to what you are doing with pipelines in our country in a Facebook message. Respectfully, there have been months of protests by people standing in the face of this project. This is the pipeline that has brought about one of the largest gathering of Native peoples in the history of the United States. Tens of thousands of people, from hundreds of tribes have stood in solidarity for months against the building of this pipeline. Please listen to your people. We have stolen the land of the Natives of this land, dedicated their culture and languages, took their children, and the list goes on. Yet we have never apologized. And now we want to endanger the drinking water of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, A federally recognized Indian tribe, a successor to the great Sioux nation. We have laws that require Federal agencies to consider environmental risks and to protection of Indian historic and sacred sites. But the Army corps of Engineers has chosen to ignore all those laws, and fast tracked this massive project just to meet the pipelines aggressive construction schedule. I join millions in my opposition to the construction of the Dakota pipeline. I am voicing my opposition here. February 8, 2017 at 8:26 PM Shelli Fynewever said...

Fear triggers many split-second changes in the body to help defend against danger or to avoid it. Nearly everyone will experience a range of reactions after trauma, yet most people recover from initial symptoms naturally. Those who continue to experience problems may be diagnosed with PTSD. People who have PTSD may feel stressed or frightened even when they are not in danger. Signs and Symptoms Not every traumatized person develops ongoing (chronic) or even short-term (acute) PTSD. Not everyone with PTSD has been through a dangerous event. Some experiences, like the sudden, unexpected death of a loved one, can also cause PTSD. Symptoms usually begin early, within 3 months of the traumatic incident, but sometimes they begin years afterward. Symptoms must last more than a month and be severe enough to interfere with relationships or work to be considered PTSD. The course of the illness varies. Some people recover within 6 months, while others have symptoms that last much longer. In some people, the condition becomes chronic. A doctor who has experience helping people with mental illnesses, such as a psychiatrist or psychologist, can diagnose PTSD. Words, objects, or situations that are reminders of the event can also trigger re-experiencing symptoms. Avoidance symptoms include: Staying away from places, events, or objects that are reminders of the traumatic experience Avoiding thoughts or feelings related to the traumatic event Things that remind a person of the traumatic event can trigger avoidance symptoms. These symptoms may cause a person to change his or her personal routine. For example, after a bad car accident, a person who usually drives may avoid driving or riding in a car. These symptoms can make the person feel stressed and angry. They may make it hard to do daily tasks, such as sleeping, eating, or concentrating. Cognition and mood symptoms include: Trouble remembering key features of the traumatic event Negative thoughts about oneself or the world Distorted feelings like guilt or blame Loss of interest in enjoyable activities Cognition and mood symptoms can begin or worsen after the traumatic event, but are not due to injury or substance use. These symptoms can make the person feel alienated or detached from friends or family members. It is natural to have some of these symptoms after a dangerous event. Sometimes people have very serious symptoms that go away after a few weeks. This is called acute stress disorder, or ASD. PTSD is often accompanied by depression, substance abuse, or one or more of the other anxiety disorders. Children and teens can have extreme reactions to trauma, but their symptoms may not be the same as adults. In very young children (less than 6 years of age), these symptoms can include: Wetting the bed after having learned to use the toilet Forgetting how to or being unable to talk Acting out the scary event during playtime Being unusually clingy with a parent or other adult Older children and teens are more likely to show symptoms similar to those seen in adults. They may also develop disruptive, disrespectful, or destructive behaviors. Older children and teens may feel guilty for not preventing injury or deaths. They may also have thoughts of revenge. For additional information, visit the Learn More section below. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) offers free print materials in English and Spanish. These can be read online, downloaded, or delivered to you in the mail. Risk Factors Anyone can develop PTSD at any age. This includes war veterans, children, and people who have been through a physical or sexual assault, abuse, accident, disaster, or many other serious events. According to the National Center for PTSD, about 7 or 8 out of every 100 people will experience PTSD at some point in their lives. Women are more likely to develop PTSD than men, and genes may make some people more likely to develop PTSD than others. Not everyone with PTSD has been through a dangerous event. Some people develop PTSD after a friend or family member experiences danger or harm. The sudden, unexpected death of a loved one can also lead to PTSD. It is important to remember that not everyone who lives through a dangerous event develops PTSD. In fact, most people will not develop the disorder. Many factors play a part in whether a person will develop PTSD. Some examples are listed below. Risk factors make a person more likely to develop PTSD. Other factors, called resilience factors, can help reduce the risk of the disorder. With more research, someday it may be possible to predict who is likely to develop PTSD and to prevent it. Everyone is different, and PTSD affects people differently so a treatment that works for one person may not work for another. It is important for anyone with PTSD to be treated by a mental health provider who is experienced with PTSD. Some people with PTSD need to try different treatments to find what works for their symptoms. If someone with PTSD is going through an ongoing trauma, such as being in an abusive relationship, both of the problems need to be addressed. Other ongoing problems can include panic disorder, depression, substance abuse, and feeling suicidal. Medications The most studied medications for treating PTSD include antidepressants, which may help control PTSD symptoms such as sadness, worry, anger, and feeling numb inside. Antidepressants and other medications may be prescribed along with psychotherapy. Other medications may be helpful for specific PTSD symptoms. For example, although it is not currently FDA approved, research has shown that Prazosin may be helpful with sleep problems, particularly nightmares, commonly experienced by people with PTSD. Doctors and patients can work together to find the best medication or medication combination, as well as the right dose. Psychotherapy can occur one-on-one or in a group. Talk therapy treatment for PTSD usually lasts 6 to 12 weeks, but it can last longer. Research shows that support from family and friends can be an important part of recovery. Many types of psychotherapy can help people with PTSD. Some types target the symptoms of PTSD directly. Other therapies focus on social, family, or job-related problems. Effective psychotherapies tend to emphasize a few key components, including education about symptoms, teaching skills to help identify the triggers of symptoms, and skills to manage the symptoms. One helpful form of therapy is called cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. CBT can include: Exposure therapy. This helps people face and control their fear. It gradually exposes them to the trauma they experienced in a safe way. It uses imagining, writing, or visiting the place where the event happened. The therapist uses these tools to help people with PTSD cope with their feelings. Cognitive restructuring. This helps people make sense of the bad memories. Sometimes people remember the event differently than how it happened. They may feel guilt or shame about something that is not their fault. The therapist helps people with PTSD look at what happened in a realistic way. There are other types of treatment that can help as well. People with PTSD should talk about all treatment options with a therapist. Treatment should equip individuals with the skills to manage their symptoms and help them participate in activities that they enjoyed before developing PTSD. How Talk Therapies Help People Overcome PTSD Talk therapies teach people helpful ways to react to the frightening events that trigger their PTSD symptoms. Based on this general goal, different types of therapy may: Teach about trauma and its effects Use relaxation and anger-control skills Provide tips for better sleep, diet, and exercise habits Help people identify and deal with guilt, shame, and other feelings about the event Focus on changing how people react to their PTSD symptoms. For example, therapy helps people face reminders of the trauma. It may be very hard to take that first step to help yourself. It is important to realize that although it may take some time, with treatment, you can get better. If you are unsure where to go for help, ask your family doctor. An emergency room doctor can also provide temporary help and can tell you where and how to get further help. To help yourself while in treatment: Talk with your doctor about treatment options Engage in mild physical activity or exercise to help reduce stress Set realistic goals for yourself Break up large tasks into small ones, set some priorities, and do what you can as you can Try to spend time with other people, and confide in a trusted friend or relative. Tell others about things that may trigger symptoms. Expect your symptoms to improve gradually, not immediately Identify and seek out comforting situations, places, and people Caring for yourself and others is especially important when large numbers of people are exposed to traumatic events (such as natural disasters, accidents, and violent acts). For more information, see the Learn More section, below. Next Steps for PTSD Research In the last decade, progress in research on the mental and biological foundations of PTSD has lead scientists to focus on better understanding the underlying causes of why people experience a range of reactions to trauma. NIMH-funded researchers are exploring trauma patients in acute care settings to better understand the changes that occur in individuals whose symptoms improve naturally. Other research is looking at how fear memories are affected by learning, changes in the body, or even sleep. Research on preventing the development of PTSD soon after trauma exposure is also under way. Still other research is attempting to identify what factors determine whether someone with PTSD will respond well to one type of intervention or another, aiming to develop more personalized, effective, and efficient treatments. As gene research and brain imaging technologies continue to improve, scientists are more likely to be able to pinpoint when and where in the brain PTSD begins. Clinical trials are research studies that look at new ways to prevent, detect, or treat diseases and conditions, including PTSD. During clinical trials, treatments might be new drugs or new combinations of drugs, new surgical procedures or devices, or new ways to use existing treatments. The goal of clinical trials is to determine if a new test or treatment works and is safe. Although individual participants may benefit from being part of a clinical trial, participants should be aware that the primary purpose of a clinical trial is to gain new scientific knowledge so that others may be better helped in the future. Please Note: Decisions about whether to apply for a clinical trial and which ones are best suited for a given individual are best made in collaboration with your licensed health professional. Doctors at NIMH are dedicated to mental health research. The studies take place at the NIH Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland and require regular visits. After the initial phone interview, you will come to an appointment at the clinic and meet with one of our clinicians. (search: PTSD).

We had been told white bodies could help by surrounding native ones, shielding them while they sought to protect their water. Its most recent manifestation is this pipeline. I have meditated on that profession of love several days ago from a grown man wielding a bat to threaten us. After our class argued over how we might know when these frictions came to possess the machinery of government, one student declared emphatically that if we could not already recognize that the friction had taken over, then we would never see it. It was hard to disagree, especially the day after our encounter with the pipeline workers when the police pepper sprayed a Lakota prayer service and those of us surrounding it, arresting whom they could. The idea directly influenced Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who added their own positive notions to resistance. Gandhi insisted that more than ahimsa (the Sanskrit word for causing no harm) was needed in the Indian independence movement. We ought to ask ourselves whether Thoreau was right.

There was no clear consensus on the parameters for civil disobedience. Of course, it is not for others to dictate to the Lakota how to protect their water. And if the law of the machine, a law of military and economic profit, enacted by generals and tycoons, must be broken in favor of the needs of man, let the law be broken.

THE FIRST word that I can think of is spirit. But I found out what Native people believe about veterans, and also more about what's happened to Native Americans. When I was serving in the military, I quickly realized that things weren't quite how they said. When I was young, I believed that the U.S. helps people get freedom and helps people find democracy. But then, when we were over there, we were fighting for oil, and everybody knew it. I saw them bomb Fallujah from my ship, and they killed thousands and thousands of people for oil. That's how I feel about it. I participated in that, and I haven't been right ever since. When I heard about this happening at Standing Rock, it made me think that maybe the only reason they hadn't killed everybody is because we're on American soil. That just made me afraid for them, but it also made me think that we can't let this happen. If something like this happens, it's because we let it happen. I didn't want to be part of letting that happen ever again. So I really wanted to come, and when I was looking for other people to come with me, I found out about the veterans coming to Standing Rock, and I thought that was perfect. A lot of veterans' struggles are very similar to Native struggles, and a lot of Native people serve in the military. Honestly, I feel like Native people love this country more than anybody. It's really something to be ashamed about--what's gone down in these communities and how there's never been any action taken to make things right. And to see it continue in this day and age, when we think we' re so open and free--but it's really only a certain percentage of people who live like that. I came to try to give something back--anything. I think that of any of the communities in the United States, these communities are the ones that have made us everything that we are. None of us would be here, and none of our lifestyles would be the same if all these people hadn't died. This is a much bigger battle than just stopping that one pipeline. I'm aware of that, and I know that a lot of other people are aware. Even if we do stop this pipeline, it's just the beginning of a really big battle, and I'm in it to win it. I HAVE no idea. What the veterans have been talking about and hoping for is that if enough of us are on the ground here, it won't be an issue--that the pipeline builders will stand down. Their lease is up in January, they're in trouble, and they know it. I think the veterans' presence is going to be intimidating. I bet a lot of the guys on the DAPL side are vets, and they're going to feel kind of ashamed about what they're doing. I think that's the benefit of having the vets here in the camp--we know what it feels like to be on the wrong side. Most of us will probably never do that wrong thing again. This is our opportunity to do what's right and get a little redemption for ourselves.

I may have missed the event entirely had it not been for the e-mails I received from some of the environmental action groups with which I stand. There was little mention of the Standing Rock protests until Democracy Now's Amy Goodman visited the site in September, and reported the attacks made on the non-violent men and women protecting their water. The Coalition had been occupying at Standing Rock since April 1st to take action and stop Sunoco's pipeline construction. Protesters were being bitten by attack dogs, pepper-sprayed, tear-gassed, shot with plastic bullets, arrested, strip-searched and fined, but the mainstream media ignored the conflict, and any obligation they might have (I deduce it is none) to report civil rights abuses in the country its viewers live within. As soon as Democracy Now broadcasted Amy Goodman's report, North Dakota Storm Troopers issued a warrant for Goodman's arrest, Criminal Trespassing. When she returned to North Dakota for her court appearance, she was arrested again, this time for Rioting. A judge threw out both charges. I wonder why the corporate media remained silent, and sent nobody to report on what was happening there. Instead, some re-broadcasted Democracy Now's report, or portions of it, weeks later. In November, I happened across an NPR broadcast of a discussion about Standing Rock. Native American Elders from the coalition forces spoke of their struggle to protect their water supply, the Missouri River, from certain contamination if Big Oil, the American Petroleum Institute (API) laid its pipeline. The NPR signal faded, and I searched the radio for something else. As fate would have it, I landed on a financial news report. The correspondent was interviewing the mayor of a North Dakota town that got itself caught up in the oil boom. This particular town borrowed a couple of hundred million dollars to lay out infrastructure to support oil fracking in its backyard, while visions of money bags danced in their collective heads. But the price of crude stayed low, and their loan interest piled high, and they could not sell their crude at a price that would cover the monetary expense of welcoming the Oil companies to their town. The town had to increase their police force by a factor of 10. We won't mention ecological expense here. The DAPL delay was costing oil towns even more money. So, Sunoco's armies unleashed their dogs, tear-gas canisters and water cannons, not on the criminals in Oil town, but on the peaceful folk trying to protect their water. The corporate media took off their gags long enough to let Sunoco tell their side of the story. I felt as though America just jumped backward to 2008. News sources confirmed that Trump, heavily invested in Sunoco and the DAPL, sought to eliminate the EPA so that dirty industries wouldn't have to ignore feeble environmental protections anymore. The Democrat response to Boss Trump was Hillary Clinton. I'm not a Demublican, so I don't know. It's almost 2017. Once again, I don't know. - Advertisement - Luckily for the planet, Clinton lost. Unfortunately Trump won. I begin to understand the hopelessness and sense of abandonment that the Native Americans must feel. I became more interested in the Native Americans' struggle at Standing Rock. One would have to be a die-hard imperialist, or an API spokesperson to argue that the indigenous people have no legitimate claim to the entirety of the Dakotas. Another talking-head proclaimed that he would like nothing more than to see the US energy system completely fossil-fuel free. But, he elaborated, it would be catastrophic if the Nation were to do it now, all at once. It would be like a financial apocalypse for the API corporations and all those invested in their commodities and exploits. And so, he would have no other option but to spend X Trillion tax dollars (none of them his) to bail those nation-critical corporations out. Deja vu. Again, we are on the cusp of 2017, and most of us have known since 1960 that everything about fossil-fuels is filthy and ecologically destructive. Even API, after decades of publishing lies claiming otherwise, now admits that Global Warming (Climate Change) is a consequence of putting way too much carbon into the atmosphere. Extracting, processing, transporting and burning fossil-fuels has been a catastrophe for the Earth, her weather and All who breathe her air and drink her water. When I was in the Navy, sailors would sometimes get frustrated when made to work under conditions that might have been avoided had the boss just thought ahead a little bit. US industry and its market-based economy should have been weaned off their fossil-fuel addiction decades ago. So if API and its minions suffer catastrophe, it is only because they chose to stay ultra-comfy in their ultra-greediness, and ignored, even lied about the impacts of their actions. It is their own fault. It is our fault. Let me be perfectly clear here. I don't want to see anyone killed. I don't want to see folks tear-gassed, tortured, shot with plastic bullets, or attacked by dogs even, but it might be a good idea to release some of the Water Protectors and whistle-blowers from jail (Leonard Peltier and Eric Snowden come to mind) to make room for say Oil and Gas corporate hierarchy. I want to see the Fossil-fuel industries and their ecologically destructive impacts, not people, exterminated. The defenders of Standing Rock call themselves Water Protectors. I get the sense that they make no real claim that the land or water is their property. Property ownership is a concept that Columbus (with a national holiday in his honor), and the other European Conquistadors brought to this hemisphere and force-fed the indigenous people. The Water Protectors are doing something much greater than protecting their water supplies. They are protecting our Earth for our grandchildren, and our grandchildrens' great-grandchildren. They are showing all of us a path forward, a Good way. They send us a wake-up call, and plead with us to regain, maybe find for the first time, our wits and balance for the sake of All the Creations. I am deeply touched by the selflessness, courage, resilience and love of the Earth that the Water Protectors display. They are defending the Living and the Unborn from a very real Machine of Terror. I am a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces which are an integral part of that Machine. In hindsight, I realized that I served a nation controlled by money-hungry scoundrels, with schemes that were anything but honorable. I never felt pride as a consequence of my veteran status, but when 2000 Veterans for Peace took the field at Standing Rock, I felt a tinge of pride, and shame, and hope. Those veterans, allies of the Water Protectors, helped to win the First Battle of Standing Rock against Big Oil and his Storm Troopers. Footnote: As I proofed my letter, and checked some facts, it came to my attention that on about December 12th, 2016, a North Dakota pipeline leaked an estimated 176,000 gallons of crude into a nearby creek. Sub-zero temperatures have made clean-up impossible. The company owning the pipe has reported 36 other spills since 2006. Since 1996, there have been 4 oil-spills per year in North Dakota alone.

Matthews It's Election Day--but we're not going to talk about the election this week. We've shared our thoughts with you, but now you're on your own. Good luck and remember to always vote your conscience. This week we're concentrating on what sort of America we'll have in spite of the person who sits in the Oval Office. We're looking at who is truly calling the shots in our government. It's not the president, it's not the Congress, and it's not the Supreme Court, either. Our corporate masters of the one-percent are our true leaders, and they've decreed that drilling or fracking for oil and gas is the most important thing in the world. It's even more important than the lives of the people they wish to sell their products to, which makes no sense really since once we've gone extinct... Theirs is truly a warped philosophy. Big Oil must make trillions in profits at the expense of the planet and its climate, at the expense of the people's health and safety, and at the expense of the peace of the nations. Once you've come to accept this as your Gospel, nothing else matters. A group of fifty Ohioans braved the rush hour traffic and the car exhaust and took a stand against Big Oil's twisted logic recently. They stood on a busy highway in front of an Ohio State Highway Patrol office near Toledo Express Airport, carrying signs indicating their displeasure with Ohio Governor John Kasich (a former Republican presidential candidate) and his decision to send 37 Ohio state troopers to North Dakota to terrorize the peaceful water protectors at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The protestors didn't know how their message would be received by the general public, but they boldly stood up for the civil rights of their fellow Americans anyway. In the end, they were rewarded with quite a few honks of agreement and thumbs up. Plenty of reporters showed up and taped interviews and snapped photos. Even the local troopers were polite and accommodating of the protest. Not everyone has drunk the Kool-Aid of Big Oil it seems after all. Our Revolution is in its early days still, but now isn't the time to hesitate. Now is the time to start making those signs and marching in those parades and chanting slogans to passers-by. Now is the time to win the hearts and souls of our fellow citizens, to shout at them to stay awake and remain vigilant. Now is not the time to simply turn over and go back to sleep and allow the oligarchs to continue their stranglehold on hurting peoples everywhere and our planet's very existence. Forget the election and the villains it gave rise to. They're worth forgetting. But never forget what our purpose in life truly is--it's to take care of each other. Get out there and take action to make the world a better place for all. There are many ways to help the water protectors at Standing Rock. The video below gives you some ideas, and the next story provides contact information for you to let those responsible for this travesty know how you feel. Mni Wiconi--Water is Sacred: A Peace Gathering for Standing Rock A crowd of about 80 turned out on a sunny autumn afternoon in the college town of Bowling Green, Ohio, to send prayers and well-wishes to the people of Standing Rock. Native Americans, college professors, environmentalists, students, and an environmental lawyer and a city council member shared their thoughts about what is happening on the reservation. They gave insights, history, science and legal information we can act upon to close down the Dakota Access pipeline and others like it, such as Ohio's Nexus pipeline (planned to cross under the Maumee River), once and for all. The irony of the DAPL is that its original route was to go north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, but the residents of the capital city of Bismarck didn't want it routed their way. History repeats itself as rich whites in Bismarck avoid the threat to their water supply, and they put their poorer Native American neighbors' water supply at risk. To date this year, North Dakota alone has experienced 273 uncontained oil spills and 908 contained spills, demonstrating the water protectors' very real fear of contamination of the Missouri River by a possible pipeline accident. More than 250 tribes have traveled to the camps at Standing Rock to show their solidarity with the Sioux nation. UN monitors and the ACLU have also traveled there to watch and note any excessive use of law enforcement against the activists, including the use of pepper spray, water cannons, rubber bullets and attack dogs. Navajo nation flag Everyone is encouraged to keep sharing Standing Rock information and news on all social media platforms, since the mainstream media is ignoring what is happening to the water protectors. Contacting our government officials, the Army Corps of Engineers, and the pipeline builders, Energy Transfer Partners, is also encouraged. Protests, parades and fundraising concerts to help out Standing Rock's legal and other expenses were discussed after the program. Donations of camping equipment, food, hygiene products and clothing are being accepted for the camps and will be transported there by volunteers leaving soon. Winter is coming, and the supplies will be needed. Please contact the politicians and business leaders listed below and let them know how you feel about the treatment of the water protectors at the Dakota Access Pipeline. Governor John Kasich (Ohio): 614-466-3555 and request the 37 Ohio State Troopers sent to Standing Rock be brought home immediately. The White House: 202-456-1111 or 202-456-1414. Tell President Obama to rescind the Army Corps of Engineers' Permit for the DAPL. Water IS life and it IS sacred, no matter what the oligarchs say. And yes, oil is important we do in fact need oil for basic things. Yes, we do get oil from those countries, and yes there are terror groups like ISIS in those countries with lots of oil.

It really breaks my heart. Monet explains despite the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), which mandates law enforcement nationwide to lend assistance during emergencies or disasters, Governor Steve Bullock had concerns the agreement was being misused. I have been in protest situations in my career and fully understand that in many cases law enforcement is placed in the middle of two emotional opposing interests and we have to attempt to balance our role as peace officer and law enforcement. Many of you emailed and called the Office to voice your concerns. As your Sheriff I was very humbled by the honest conversations we had. One of the biggest differences of an elected Sheriff from other law enforcement leaders is that I am directly accountable to the people I serve (YOU) and although I am personally torn knowing that people (Including Montanans) are hurting over there, we will not be responding. Finally I am incredibly grateful that we live in a place where we can have differences and talk about them respectfully as adults without conflict. Gootkin and the Gallatin County deputies never made it to North Dakota, but other departments briefly assisted the Morton County Sheriff, and then refused to complete planned rotations, pulled out, and never returned. However, water protectors and independent journalists on the scene contend law enforcement brutalized water protectors, disrespectfully disassembled tipis, and refused to allow anyone to gather their belongings. Some claimed when they returned to the scene much later, officers had carelessly thrown tents, clothing, and other items in a pile, leaving all of it damaged and soaked in what seemed to be ammonia and urine. In short, public pressure can be surprisingly effective. Some have since returned from those deployments while others may still be present in North Dakota. Considering the success of public outcry in forcing law enforcement to reconsider policing the Standing Rock movement to protect the water, following is the contact information from the websites for the appropriate North Dakota officials and law enforcement departments from all states, as listed by the ACLU. Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people. We feel that PIVX is this system. PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people. It is the ultimate weapon in the battle against the money changers and information controllers because PIVX is the only cryptocurrency in existence that allows for completely anonymous storage while simultaneously paying interest.

Such laws have been implemented against a diverse list of extremist movements, from the Ku Klux Klan to Occupy Wall Street. Probably not. While the motivations are understandable, the policy is misguided. People wear masks for a lot of perfectly legitimate reasons, as the list of exemptions in the proposed legislation attests. Should this bill become law, a mask worn for a holiday or for a parade or because of the weather would be legal, but a mask worn during a demonstration would not be. This makes me think of the wrong-headed arguments people often make against guns. But those of us who support gun rights point out that guns do not commit crimes. They are a tool, with a number of perfectly legitimate uses. The same can be said of masks. People commit crimes. Outlawing the wearing of masks would accomplish very little, other than perhaps allowing law enforcement to sometimes arrest people at political demonstrations for wearing masks.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii, a combat war veteran, will be joining the act of resistance, according to the Facebook page Veterans Stand for Standing Rock. As Task and Purpose notes, federal government ignored their duty under the National Historic Preservation Act to consult the Standing Rock Sioux before approving DAPL. While federal government abandoned Native Americans once again, law enforcement are acting as militarized protection services for Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based company behind the 1,170-mile pipeline. State and local governments are set to reap millions in taxes once the oil begins flowing. The main man behind it all is Wes Clark, Jr., son of Gen. Wesley Clark, a former Supreme Allied Commander who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. Clark Sr. called for action on climate change, and this motivation is also driving his son to fight against DAPL. Clark and Wood say they are prepared to take a bullet for the cause, and they are going in well-prepared. The veterans will don old military uniforms and be equipped with body armor, ear plugs and gas masks. A packing list virtually mirrors the ones issued to soldiers preparing to deploy to the field (minus the weapons). But there are also parts of the document that read like a revolutionary manifesto. With a group of possibly 500 veterans and other brave souls, they will lock arms and cross the Missouri River to non-violently confront militarized police armed with rifles, mace, batons and dogs. Traditional Sioux war songs will be played as they attempt to peacefully surround the drill pad from which the pipeline will be bored under the river.

The courts had no shame in how they treated us. The outcome of most cases to date involve unsupervised probation and the erasure of charges after one year. Although the prosecution did not recommend jail time, Judge Merrick insisted on it. He also ordered Redway and Simon be taken into custody immediately, despite requests for a turn-in date which would allow them time to get their affairs in order. To date, the vast majority have been dismissed for lack of evidence. However, the defendants on trial this week were among those recharged by the State after their original charges were dismissed. Neither have prior convictions. They were doing the right thing.

We are still fighting for our lives on our own land. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard posted Sep 03, 2016 On this day, 153 years ago, my great-great-grandmother Nape Hote Win (Mary Big Moccasin) survived the bloodiest conflict between the Sioux Nations and the U.S. Army ever on North Dakota soil. An estimated 300 to 400 of our people were killed in the Inyan Ska (Whitestone) Massacre, far more than at Wounded Knee. But very few know the story. We cannot forget our stories of survival. Just 50 miles east of here, in 1863, nearly 4,000 Yanktonais, Isanti (Santee), and Hunkpapa gathered alongside a lake in southeastern North Dakota, near present-day Ellendale, for an intertribal buffalo hunt to prepare for winter. Many refugees from the 1862 uprising in Minnesota, mostly women and children, had been taken in as family. This was part of a broader U.S. military expedition to promote white settlement in the eastern Dakotas and protect access to the Montana gold fields via the Missouri River. As she ran, she was shot in the hip and went down. She laid there until morning, when a soldier found her. As he loaded her into a wagon, she heard her relatives moaning and crying on the battlefield. The stones are not created anymore, ever since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dredged the mouth of the Cannonball River and flooded the area in the late 1950s as they finished the Oahe dam. They killed a portion of our sacred river. I was a young girl when the floods came and desecrated our burial sites and Sundance grounds. Our people are in that water. Now the river water is no longer safe to drink. Look north and east now, toward the construction sites where they plan to drill under the Missouri River any day now, and you can see the old Sundance grounds, burial grounds, and Arikara village sites that the pipeline would destroy. Below the cliffs you can see the remnants of the place that made our sacred stones. And as it erases our footprint from the world, it erases us as a people. These sites must be protected, or our world will end, it is that simple. Our young people have a right to know who they are. They have a right to language, to culture, to tradition. And more keep coming. This is the first gathering of the Oceti Sakowin (Sioux tribes) since the Battle of the Greasy Grass (Battle of Little Bighorn) 140 years ago. When we first established the Sacred Stone Camp on April 1 to stop the pipeline through prayer and non-violent direct action, I did not know what would happen. But our prayers were answered. We must remember we are part of a larger story. We should not have to fight so hard to survive on our own lands. My son is buried there, too. We are the river, and the river is us. We have no choice but to stand up. Today, we honor all those who have survived centuries of struggle. Today, we stand together in prayer to demand a future for our people. No Paywall. No Ads.

Karen Van Fossan, Minister at the UU Fellowship and Church of Bismarck-Mandan to learn more about the engagement of their congregation in support of Standing Rock and ways UUs throughout the country can support the work of the water protectors there. Nora: I have only been here a few days but appreciate what has looked to be an organic and transformative relationship that has emerged between your congregation and folks at Standing Rock. Ronya: I first visited when it was Sacred Stone. We knew there were needs. I got up in front of the congregation and asked if folks could donate any paper goods for the kitchen. People were very kind and generous in the congregation. The movement in Standing Rock grew quickly, and the engagement at the church with Standing Rock grew parallel, and with similar speed. At the same time Baton Rouge floods were happening, along with other crises. It was powerful to see that folks gave to both. People here are donating without any self-glory; they are not focused on asking for recognition. Karen: A progressive group in town was organizing folks to send more supplies and asked our congregation to be a drop off spot. Before we knew it we were THE drop off spot in town. There has always been a physical solidarity component to this work: first it was physical things being delivered, and volunteering in the kitchen. Increasingly we became involved in the bigger camp: we would go a few times a week, go to meetings, camp there. We also quickly realized we were a hub for UUs from other places who wanted to support the work, and for other people of conviction who thought to contact a local faith community as a way to be in solidarity. There have been more and more calls for leaders of faith communities to both identify ourselves as well as to show up when we do. We are carrying out what we believe in by going there. I love this gesture of our church taking lead from (and flanking) Standing Rock. Our Social Action Working Group (SAWG) meetings are getting fuller and fuller. Though the UU community has always been energetic here, there are now stronger roots to the justice work that we are doing. Ronya: In the past, there would be a beginning and end to our engagement and whoever donated would have felt good about it. With this work, its like you can touch the bottom. You know where you are, you know the goal, you know your place in this much bigger movement. When I use water now, this has shifted my relationship. When I use water, and every time I let it run, I see my granddaughter in the water and her not having that water. So I have to work for it now, for that future. Now because I have been in a place to protect this water, I have such a different relationship to it. You are both lifting up profound questions about our own future and the possibility of future generations. Ronya: Prayer. I have intentionally prayed more in last six months than in my entire life. In recent months you- Karen - did a sermon about the power of prayer. That absolutely impacted me. I define it as kind, thoughtful and intentional conversations with the universe. Karen: Standing Rock has facilitated a reflection between giving up, and giving over something of myself. When I see the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) moving along the land, it takes everything in me to not go stop it: I have always loved that river. From what I have experienced from traditional Lakota values (what I have learned through Ronya and through folks at the camp), this is a space that has been created that if you are hungry, you can eat; if you are thirsty, there is water; if you are hurt, there is a clinic; there is space at the fire for you; there is always prayer. These are things that are given to each of us. I have lived in different places in my life, I have been accustomed to chronic loneliness. I have known pervasive, chronic loneliness. And that is gone. Ronya: There is such a long history of abuse. There is a little conflict there. The people who have shown up in Standing Rock have love in their hearts and have illustrated a general sense of respect. In general, they are not here to appropriate our experiences; but also understand that the tribe is comfortable being the spearhead with others supporting us. It is good to have people of faith involved with the movement. Civil disobedience is not something people can or should go into lightly. We are thankful for any and all support that is showing up at Standing Rock. It is so powerful to see so many people showing up in support. That all of this exists in the context of the doctrine of discovery. I think that work has something to do with why Unitarian Universalism was able and willing to show up at this time. It is not to say that systems of oppression are not still in place and some of us are still benefitting from them. When I see people doing things like songs, dance, and prayer that are not mine, I just get to be an invited witness. It is also important that I remember the grief that I feel is not the job of Native people to take care of. When I am in solidarity, I will face both shame for being the intended recipient of systems of oppression and the beneficiary of systems of oppression. I often say I receive more than I give. That is indeed true. Ronya: When you set your foot in that camp you have to trust that folks will take care of you, and that we are taking care of each other. No one enters that camp without having made some sort of sacrifice in their life. And that matters. I hope and guess that everybody goes away knowing that it is a gift to be able to be part of it. No one is excluded from this. Rocks, air, land, humans: we all have a connection to water.

This reflection touches on some of most poignant moments for me. Of those who plead not guilty, all but one requested jury trials. When I heard that, I wished I would have pleaded not guilty. There were two people I watched go in front of the judge that day who were not connected to the protest. For the tactic of flooding the court system with jury trials to work most effectively, it would have been advantageous for us to discuss the option and its potential results and consequences beforehand as a group, so that some of the people who pleaded guilty might have instead pleaded not guilty and requested a jury trial. The judge seemed to be caught off guard and seemed to really consider the request. I wonder what would have happened if this question were asked by the first person from our group who stood in front of the judge. Perhaps we could have saved ourselves some money. I was excited to see the ways in which this second NVDA workshop I attended was different. The speaker stated that the Mississippi Stand action camp had specifically developed for people interested in nonviolent forms of action and that actions planned for the camp would be nonviolent and would not include sabotage. However, the speaker encouraged, too, that people recognize a common enemy and support that various groups are attacking in various ways. Someone mentioned an instance where hundreds of people gave the same false name to authorities after being arrested; people told stories of tree-sits, barricades, sit-ins, occupations, lock-downs, mass marches and other forms of direct action. Once arrested, a person had to sit down. If a cop stayed with the arrested person, three people had to tag that person for an un-arrest. Meanwhile, people ran in various patterns looking for opportunities to make a move toward the pole or unarrest people. I was really excited, several days later, to find a video in which three people used similar tactics to un-arrest a fellow protester. I was happy to be in a place with people experimenting with non-hierarchical structures. I liked that everyone could choose how they wanted to participate day-by-day or moment-by-moment. I enjoyed the slow pace of cooking by fire for hours before a meal while hanging out and getting to know others at camp. I had fun with the urgency and excitement of the direct action side of things. I soaked up being outdoors for a week in the chilly Fall weather and ended up liking that, too. I appreciated the spirituality of the camp, too; I felt comfortable accepting an open invitation from a Native person at camp to participate in a peace pipe ceremony that was new to me, and I felt open to exploring prayer as something other than the Judeo-Christian prayer I grew up with. I also liked to spend time singing and drumming at the ditch where the DAPL private security would guard the access road to a construction site. A few people consistently volunteered for long or overnight shifts on security duty or keeping the sacred fire going, which left them frustrated and wishing others would volunteer. The camp structure had evolved to include committees for some areas (such as media, security, and infrastructure), but sometimes it was difficult, especially for short-term campers, to connect with the committees, even when the committee could use the help and the person was eager to give it. Sometimes various misunderstandings arose. The Native people who came from Standing Rock said they felt unwelcome because the sacred fire at camp had died down to embers when they arrived in the middle of the night; they explained that the fire needed to be kept going so that the ancestors would stay nearby and be warm. In our morning meeting, one of the Native people explained several ways that the spirituality of the camp could be improved and asked to say a prayer before people left to protest at the ditch. In the prayer, the person fervently asked Creator to not allow anyone to be arrested. To me, the petition seemed out of place since many at the camp viewed risking arrest as one of the available strategies for drawing attention to the pipeline, challenging the law, and ultimately stopping construction. These moments were confusing and difficult to navigate. On one hand, the camp was, in part, standing in solidarity with Standing Rock, and a few Native people as well as non-Native people there were carrying out Native spiritual practices. Perhaps the small contingent of Natives in the camp was happy to have the increased support of the group that came (despite the accompanying criticisms of the status quo), and perhaps the group of Natives would have offered more fullness to practices that were potentially appropriated for use at the camp. Others grabbed banners and signs and began marching around the area. That day, authorities all decided to do nothing. The protesters took this as an opportunity to set up camp at the site, complete with an R.V. donated to the cause. On the Home Front My time at Mississippi Stand allowed me to engage with a small but active group of protesters who created a second front (in addition to Standing Rock) in the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline. My ancestral burial grounds are not at stake. The NoDAPL movement, and Mississippi Stand and Standing Rock in particular, have also shown us that mass mobilization and long-term, well-supported actions are possible. At least tens of thousands of people have travelled to Mississippi Stand and Standing Rock, and for those who have journeyed home, they are taking with them experiences of carrying out direct actions, adapting spontaneously to the cops and other hurdles, coping with police brutality, building teepees, cooking for hundreds of people, and living in a makeshift camp with dozens or thousands of others. Those people are now connected to one another and ready to act. account."}, {"URL": "https://www.nps.gov/sand/learn/historyculture/index.htm", "Timestamp": "20180918234302", "Sentences": "Courtesy of History Colorado H.6130.37 At dawn on November 29, 1864, approximately 675 U.S. volunteer soldiers commanded by Colonel John M. Chivington attacked a village of about 750 Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians along Sand Creek in southeastern Colorado Territory. Using small arms and howitzer fire, the troops drove the people out of their camp. While many managed to escape the initial onslaught, others, particularly noncombatant women, children, and the elderly fled into and up the bottom of the dry stream bed. The soldiers followed, shooting at them as they struggled through the sandy earth. At a point several hundred yards above the village, the women and children frantically excavated pits and trenches along either side of the streambed to protect themselves. Some adult men attempted to hold back the Army with whatever weapons they had managed to retrieve from the camp, and at several places along Sand Creek the soldiers shot people from opposite banks and brought forward the howitzers to assault their improvised defenses. Over the course of eight hours the troops killed around 230 Cheyenne and Arapaho people composed mostly of women, children, and the elderly. During the afternoon and following day, the soldiers wandered over the field committing atrocities on the dead before departing the scene on December 1 to resume campaigning. Since the barbarism of November 29, the Sand Creek Massacre maintains its station as one of the most emotionally charged and controversial events in American history, a tragedy reflective of its time and place. The background of the Sand Creek Massacre lay in a whirlwind of events and issues registered by the ongoing Civil War in the East and West; the overreactions by whites on the frontier to the 1862-63 Dakota uprising in Minnesota and its aftermath; the status of the various bands of Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians relative to each other as well as other plains tribes; the constant undercurrent of threatened Confederate incursions; and the existing state of politics in Colorado including the intrigues of individual politicians in that territory. Perhaps most important, the seeds of the Sand Creek Massacre lay in the presence of two historically discordant cultures within a geographical area that both coveted for disparate reasons, an avoidable situation that resulted in tragedy. These letters, as firsthand accounts of the massacre, reveal the moral resistance of some of the soldiers to the barbarism that surrounded them. As primary sources, these letters show much about the atrocities at Sand Creek while also demonstrating how a hundred men stood in resistance to orders.

BuzzFeed News identified more than 60 Facebook pages with more than 6 million fans that are generating money either by selling counterfeit Native American merchandise, or by driving traffic to ad-filled websites that in some cases have little or nothing to do with Native American issues. Native designers say their work is being stolen and resold, and that some pages falsely claim to donate proceeds to the protesters at Standing Rock. He said some Facebook pages have even taken photos of his models and photoshopped different clothing on them. Erica Moore with two people wearing one of her Standing Rock T-shirt designs. She said copies of her designs soon began showing up on Facebook and elsewhere. BuzzFeed News tracked some of the worst offending Facebook pages to owners in Vietnam. It promotes its T-shirts by photoshopping them on celebrities such as The Rock, Johnny Depp, Mark Wahlberg, and others. Many of its recent posts about clothing comment on the Standing Rock protest, though there is no evidence that the people running the page donate any proceeds to the protesters. BuzzFeed News messaged the page on Facebook and the person who replied introduced themselves as a woman in Michigan named Maria Torres who claims to be Native American on her Facebook profile. The profile appears to only have been created in March of this year and primarily shares merchandise being promoted by the Like If You Love Native Americans page. The account also reposts content and merchandise from a page called Wolves In Native American Culture which points to a domain name registered to the same person in Vietnam. The person then denied stealing designs from Native artists. The person said they simply find Native American T-shirts that have already been uploaded to SunFrog and collect them on one page, earning a commission each time they sell. SunFrog is one of several websites that enable anyone to to upload a design and then offer print-on-demand ordering for a range of clothing. He pointed to a form on its website that anyone can use to make a claim. He also said anyone who falsely claims to sell clothing in support of a cause will have their account closed and SunFrog will donate their earnings to charity. Yodzevicis said SunFrog has seen an increase in infringing designs and false charity claims related to Standing Rock. One of the bigger pages identified by BuzzFeed News is called Indigenous People of America and has over 750,000 fans. It shares a steady stream of news related to events in Standing Rock, but under many of its posts it also promotes the sale of a knockoff of a shirt created by actor Shailene Woodley to raise funds for Standing Rock. The only official seller of the Woodley shirt is Omaze, yet the design can be found for sale on many other online clothing sites as well as on Amazon. SunFrog removed a version of the shirt for sale on its site after being alerted to it by BuzzFeed News, though other copies of the design remain for sale on the site. Another big Facebook page hawking inauthentic Native American goods is Native American Indians, which has over 360,000 fans and promotes merchandise from a store called NativeThing.com. Once they receive their order people realize it was made in China, gives off a noxious odor, and that the company subsequently refuses to accept returns. Many other pages pursue a similar strategy of building up an audience with Native content and then trying to sell them shirts and other items that are often rip-offs of Native designs. One newer page is called I Stand with Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and shares a steady diet of news about the protest mixed with constant pleas for people to show their support by buying shirts for the cause. The page did not respond to a question about whether it donates any money to the tribe. Along with stealing the work of Native artists, and the likenesses of models and celebrities, some scammers even used a photo of the first Native American federal judge to create fake profiles to help spread their content. Her photo has been used on at least three fake Facebook profiles, one of which lists its two only friends as two young men in Kosovo. One of the largest networks of Native American Facebook pages initially identified by BuzzFeed News belonged to two young men in Kosovo. At the time of the interview, their pages had close to 2 million fans. However, after speaking to BuzzFeed News all of their pages were taken offline. where Dardan and a partner publish clickbait articles about a wide variety of topics, though rarely about Native Americans. Dardan did not respond to a subsequent Facebook message from BuzzFeed News asking why they had removed their Native American Facebook pages. BuzzDuzz is still publishing as of this writing. Some of the Native American designers who spoke to BuzzFeed News said the non-Natives running the pages and selling stolen designs are making more money than they are. Aaron Silva, a Native American and the co-founder of The NTVS clothing brand in Minnesota, said the dubious Native American sellers often have one or several large Facebook pages to use to promote the merchandise. Silva also said these pages spend money to create sponsored Facebook posts that promote the item for sale to large numbers of people. One of its current sponsored posts shows photos of Bernie Sanders and celebrities with the Shailene Woodley shirt. This sponsored post for a stolen design has received over 125,000 reactions, 15,000 comments, and close to 18,000 shares as of this writing. It had over 33,000 reactions, nearly 4,000 comments, and over 8,000 shares. These sponsored posts also help grow the number of fans for that page: When BuzzFeed News first found the Native American Cultures page roughly two weeks ago, it had just over 57,000 fans. It now has over 72,000. It has close to 12,000 reactions, just over 500 comments, and 2,100 shares as of this writing. The comment thread was soon filled with people sharing other examples of suspect pages, and of designers talking about how they too had their work stolen. Silva and others have also tried to contact T-shirt sites such as SunFrog and TeeChip to get their designs removed. They said the takedown forms and procedures take up a lot of their time. Yodzevicis from SunFrog said their reporting form has only a few fields to complete and submissions are checked roughly every hour. He also said the company is working to implement a procedure whereby any money earned from a stolen design will be sent to the original artist. Silva said Facebook is easier to deal with, but that it only removes the offending post rather than an entire page. Yazzie has also tried directly contacting the Facebook pages that promote his stolen designs for sale. But at most he says they will delete the post with his design and just upload it again later. For his part, Silva is amazed at how so many people in different parts of the world have discovered that dubious Native American Facebook pages, websites, and merchandise can be a moneymaker.

Anyway, I road back to the camp with them from the fairy, after we held an action in Seattle that afternoon. So... Maybe you just show up with a sign and chant and disturb the business. Maybe you all get arrested. Either case, your defenses have all been full of crap. You would plea out and take the probation, or show up for trial and tell the jury you never herd the police tell you to leave. But now, now you cooking with gas. Today, yesterday, five members from the group Rising Tide Seattle, are facing a trial as the Delta 5, for their involvement in the September 2014, blockade of a railroad or railway yard. If they did, and they probably did, this is a major coup. If the jury selection was anything like the first Occupy Orlando trespassing trial, the case is already lost. And the lawyers know that. They just tell you you have a chance because that is what you want to hear and that is how they make their house payments. The trick will be in convincing the jury that they have the power to vote in your favor. All defendants have to get up and testify, bring in witnesses to testify about climate change and the dangers of those oil bombs, especially one, one mile long and all speak the truth of reality. Normally, I would be looking at defending from statutory jurisdiction. The fake laws. But what is going on here is not a statutory arrest. There is a victim, the railroad company. And they complain they lost millions from this eight hour action. So, when it comes to trespassing on private property, I say, tell they jury why you did it. That was the advice I gave to Lisa Leggio, of the MICATS (Michigan Coalition Against Tar Sands), at some hearings before her trial. They lost. Lawyers. So what the CDC has found is basically just using the truth and letting the chips fall as they may. Let me tell you how rare this defense is. I found an Insanity Defense, Justifiable Homicide, crap like that, but no Necessity Defense. That which makes the contrary of a thing impossible. The quality or state of being necessary, in its primary sense signifying that which makes an act or event unavoidable. Quality or state of fact of being in difficulties or in need; a condition arising out of circumstances that compels a certain course of action. Bykofsky v. Borough of Middletown, D.C.Pa., 401 F.Supp. 1242, 1250. See Irresistible impulse. Snider v. Smyth, D.C.Va., 187 F.Supp. 299, 302. Com. v. Walzack, 468 Pa. 210, 360 A.2d 914, 919. See also Insanity; M'Naghten Rule. See Justification; Self-defense. Justification. Just, lawful excuse or reason for act or failing to act. A maintaining or showing a sufficient reason in court why the defendant did what he is called upon to answer, particularly in an action of libel and as a defense to criminal charges of assault or homicide (e.g. self defense). Not that one, although, one could argue that the past explosion near your home excused you from criminal liability because you were just trying to protect your life, limb and property. All of which the de facto government is not willing to prevent. Not an immediate act of self defense, but one, nonetheless, that made you feel an irresistible need to act upon. You let them know you were willing to stay there and not let these trains pass until a law was passed prohibiting them from entering . Without that, they will say you knew you were going to be arrested. You did not. You were there to stop this train from ever passing. The danger was just too great. But do it with peace and forget about it. Justification is a procedure with common-law origins by which a surety must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the court that it has sufficient ability to perform its obligations. Matthews v. IMC Mint Corp., CA.Utah, 542 F.2d 544, 546. Not that one either... Justification means explanation with supporting data. American Export-Isbrandtsen Lines, Inc. v. Federal Maritime Commission, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 181, 417 F.2d 749, 752. As defense in criminal and tort law, term means maintaining or showing a sufficient reason in court why the defendant did what he is called upon to answer or, just cause or lawful excuse for act, reasonable excuse. Young Women's Christian Ass'n of Princeton, N. J. v. Kugler, D.C.N.J., 342 F.Supp. 1048, 1062. Bingo, we have a winner. Term is not widely used in torts where, instead, defenses and privileges are common. See also Legal excuse; Necessity; Self-defense. Alabama Public Service Commission v. Crow, 247 Ala. 120, 22 So.2d 721, 724. To fulfill requirements for easement of right of way of necessity, the necessity must be actual, real, and reasonable, as distinguished from inconvenience, but it need not be absolute and irresistible necessity. When used in relation to power of eminent domain does not mean absolute necessity, but only reasonable necessity. See also Necessaries; Necessary. Good luck folks. This is going to be a tuff one to win. Jeez, you have to convince them that your actions were necessary due to inaction by OUR government, which we defendants and jurors are all a part of. You have to convince them that the government is the people and that they and you are part of those people, and that these jurors, buy allowing this to continue, while locking up those trying to stop the destruction of the species, are just perpetuating the destruction by going along with it and not taking a stand, as the People, and sending a message to Washington that this will not stand. Like I said, good luck. Finding the right jury is the key to winning. All that means is they have been brainwashed into thinking like those in charge of the government want them to think. I truly feel these people may be beyond comprehension of why you broke the law. No. Your perfect juror is the juror that is smart. Unemployed people with above average intelligence, thinkers. The questions you ask them are paramount. You are looking for those that understand that they are the people and the people are those who make up the government and therefore they are the actual government with the power to act as such. Good. Christian guilt is another thing you might want to try on the jury. If you have a jury of all people who believe that there is a God and this God is coming back to earth to judge us all, then it is up to them to do the right thing. If they wont do it for all the people on the planet, then they should do it for their God. And opposite of that are the nonbelievers. These people will have two outlooks. One, they understand reality and will be easily lead to believe that what you did you had to do and they are the only thing now standing between survival or destruction. Now the other nonbeliever is the one that thinks like a republican. You know, every man for himself. This will be the hardest to convince. But if you have this type of juror and can convince them that they really hold the power of survival and destruction in their hands, then you have started the zeitgeist that will change the world for the better. Ask them if they remember morals. Court is poker game, played with the strategy of chess. They are going to try to bluff you into a premature guilty plea and you have to out smart them. This is hard to explain. Your lawyer should understand what I mean by all this. Anyone who has had as much experience as I have in the courtroom will understand this. Part of my writing process is a lot of pacing. I pace and write in my head. I started making this page last night. While pacing for a direction to go, I started writing in my head. I started thinking how I would tell this story to the jury. Those were true feelings coming out. And boy, that song is a very powerful song which at the time of my thoughts was very serendipitous and in sync to them. This is our last dance kids, make it count. I know the pressure is getting to us all. There is one more thing you can do to get the jury to really think of this action. But I do know this is winnable. Maybe not with the first trial, but give it a few...dozen. No, I hope not. Before long the word will get out that it is the juries that are being held personally accountable for the destruction of our species. Give their names to the press. If a corrupt government will not stop the insanity, then it is up to an informed public to do the right thing. Remind them, that all evil needs to flourish is for good people to do nothing. Then ask the jury if they are good people. Best of luck...and skill. Peace. It turned out like I had described above. And even though the activist community is telling everyone it was a win, that is the furthest from the the truth. In essence, the judge told the jury that they could not consider the testimony they just heard over the past week. This evil son-of-a-bitch, never had any intentions of allowing the defendants the right to speak the truth and allow the jury to decide on it. That is exactly what Tony told them in the end. That is why I was telling you this case was lost the moment you set up your tripod and got arrested. There are many reasons for this failure, the most of which is the failure to plan. I could be wrong I always reserve the right to be wrong. I doubt it very much. This is what I am speaking about in The Plan. Any legal advice you may have gotten, if you sought it, told you that there was no way you would win this case. They would have told you this because this is exactly how this court game is played. They would know that no judge would allow you to speak the truth as to why you did what you did and ask the jury to be the judges of the morality of the law, and not the facts, here. What you would be asking for at trial, is the jury to assume the position of the government and rule that they, our government, cares more about the people then they do about the capitalist hell bent on the destruction of our world. None. I knew this from the start. They are not allowed to consider any justification that could change laws. Evil exists, it is up to us to identify it. Capitalism is diametrically opposed to Christianity. If most people view Christianity as good, then anything working against it would be bad; the evil. No. Ergo, their practice of allowing the capitalist to do what they want while locking up those trying to do the Christian thing, is anti Christian, or evil. My guess is that the Delta5 was not passionate enough to convince the jury that they would just be a cog in that agenda by convicting. So get this. Most people in this country believe there is a God and that Jesus Christ is the leader of that God. They need defendants who would not be afraid to teach the jury about FIJA. The problem is, someone is going to want a lawyer and once you have a lawyer on the legal team you might as well make plans to be convicted. The lawyers do not understand the real reason why the politicians are allowing the destruction of the species. They just do what they are told, and they are told not to rock the boat. unadulterated greed. The facts are the facts. Global Warming is real and there are other technologies out there than we can use other than oil. Car makers put the carriage makers either out of business or retooling to work with them. Same can be with the energy industry. Oil workers will either do like the carriage industry did and retool and join the new technology to produce alternate forms of energy, or go out of business. But when the conspiracy by the oil and coal companies to keep themselves in business is so strong, they either lie to gullible people, or pay them off to look the other way. In either case, they are either stupid or corrupt and this is why we must do what we must do. No capitalist, especially one who does what the fossil fuel industry does, is a Christian and neither is anyone who would work for those who killed Jesus - the government. This is why these two entities work together to ensure that the companies get to do what they do and you get to sit in jail. So it is not just capitalism, but the ignorance or more precisely the greed of the politicians to allow the greed of the capitalist. It is now up to the true Christians of this country to come to the aid of their planet. It is up to you to tell the truth of how the evil empire, aka the cops all the way up to the president of the United States, is so corrupt that they will not even allow you to speak about the truth of your actions nor allow the jury to hear them as well. You have to tell the jury that they are so evil that they will not even allow you to consider this in your acquittal. You have to tell the jury how you fought this evil all the way up to this trial and the only thing you can depend on now is them, the jury. That means every time the judge tells you you cannot speak in the courtroom you file a writ of mandamus mentioning his violating the first amendment and making him. If that judge tells you to get bent, you file a petition for writ of certiori or a title 42 civil lawsuit against those two or three judges for prohibiting your right to speak. This will all be written up and placed in this section. You tell the jury you had to do this and that the government is so corrupt, including the judge and prosecutor, that you had to tell it to a jury for anyone to help. You have to show the evil to the jury, and convince them that they have the power to initiate change. They have to be convinced that the only change moves through them. I then spent the the rest of the day figuring out exactly what he meant by what he said. I will now post two of the appearances here and dissect them. One of the videos I watched is the one on the right. Here, Tim gives a lecture to a group at a Unitarian Church. Unitarians are pretty cool people. At the 2:49 mark, Tim tells the story of how the judge would not allow him to speak freely about why he did what he did. At 3:18, he describes how the judge restricted his speech. However, Tim just took it. He never thought to file a petition for a writ of mandamus, suing the judge and making the higher court force him to do his job, which would be to follow the first amendment. Nor did he file a federal title 42, section 1983, civil lawsuit, suing this judge for violating his right, a violation of title 18, USC, sections 241 and 242, among other things. This would have really clogged up the system and began to expose the corruption of all our government employees. The reason why the first amendment is null and void in any court of law is to give the government an advantage over the people who will appear before it. By them restricting your free speech to tell a jury the real reason why you did what you did, gives them that leg up. Our founding fathers placed the first amendment in the Bill of Rights so that the government could never do what it is they are doing; terrorizing the People for a little profit, a little kickback. That is why the court makes you take a lair... I mean a lawyer. Tim goes on to say that he only heard of this Delta5 case within the last few months. This means that he heard about this long after the blockade in Portland, where the Rising Tide had attended. If he had met that Shannon girl, as I did, I doubt he would want to help them out. It is obvious. It was the necessity defense that he was able to get them. No. So the only reason why I can see Tim showing up for this court case was for this necessity defense. Tim seemed to have gotten an orgasm when this happened, not understanding why the judge would allow it. At 6:25, Tim is describing how excited he became when he learned that for the very first time, a court was going to level the playing field and allow the defendants to give an excuse for what they did. They are guilty in the eyes of the law, so their only way out is by telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. It was just a show for the audience. He never had the intention to allow this to be considered. Had he, he would have been disciplined, maybe would have lost all appeals made against him. That will take care of all the believers on the jury. Tim continues with describing the testimony he heard over the days of the trial. Only problem with that is that in reality, the jury did not hear any of it. He states that it was unprecedented that they were allowed to give all that testimony, yet again, not one bit of it was allowed to be used. Total time for trial, one day. But this guy wanted to make it look good - get you on his side, which he did. If you agree with him you agree with him. It does not matter that this was the finest case for climate activism, the jury was never going to be allowed to use it. Four points of the necessity defense criteria that one has to show is this: There has to be a reasonable expectation of an imitate harm. That harm has to be greater than the harm of breaking the law. That they could not have created the harm that their trying to avoid. Number one, there was a reasonable expectation of an imitate harm. There is already harm being placed on at least one of the defendants, Abby, because of the previous derailment. Two, that that harm has to be greater than the harm of breaking the law, is apparent in the first point. Third, it is quite obvious that they could not have created the harm, but that others, such as ISIS, could. But then there is the fourth criteria, there has to be no legal alternatives. I would assume that this is what Tony used to absolve himself from his participation. He had to have given an example, yet none is given by Tim. Saying there are other legal alternatives is not the same as giving example. These examples, if any, have to be exhausted first. Then he goes on to talk about how the judge was trying to save face by telling everyone in the courtroom that the defendants are commendable people. And the crowd claps at 12:15, even though the judge tells the jury they cannot consider any of the testimony. They truly are blind to this game this judge is playing. What he is telling everyone is that he knows that these people need to win, but he has chosen the dark side and will protect the destruction. Good. My face has been saved with my children as they accept the notion that I am just a nobody who cannot effect change in the real world and will be forgiven by the people I lockup for my sins. He chose the government over God. He should have brought it up. He should have showed the jury how the judge is trying to stop this defense. Now the verdict. He, as well as myself, is surprised when the jury delivers a not guilty verdict for obstructing a train. I have no idea what law they were charged with, but what I found is here, where it pretty much says they are guilty. Again, seen it, told you about it before it happened. Their apologies to you were to save face with you, because they are weak and scared of the government. You were also petitioning your government for a redress of grievances you are having with the lawmakers. So you sought the help of the court. This is good though, we will use it a little later on down the page. Perhaps now Tim is seeing the truth in what I write. These people will be instrumental in the progress of your cause. Your cause, because you only care for the planet, whereas my cause is in caring for everything. At 20:46, Tim gets into what the judge said about the fourth of the criteria not being met. But that was not the point of the action. But he tells how both the judge and the prosecution have a debate on what the defendants intent was, with out allowing the defendants to tell it themselves to the jury. The prosecution saying the intent was to block a train, the judge saying it was for attention and neither but both being the answer at all. You thought you were going to the judicial branch of government for redress, only to find out they are really under the direction of the executive branches of government. Only the appellate courts are the real judicial branch. So, if you thought you were going to get a little sympathy from a judge, ha, think again. The climate movement has been building ever since Greenpeace came to be. There is only one way to effect change, legally, and that is with the lawmakers. And that will only come with not guilty verdicts. Then there is a question and answer for the remaining hours of the lecture and the first one to speak is a defendant, Abby. Please, Abby, the judge took over a year to allow this defense and he never did. All he did was give the appearance that he was allowing it when the entire time he knew this would never fly. This was just sad to see. He is wrong. That is really one of the reasons why they lost. They made him mayor of Fall River. Maybe he too, could have become mayor. He should run, and find out. If anyone out there, a real person, is feeling guilt or shame, it is because they are still a little human. Only evil could do that job and not feel shame. The guilt comes when they refuse to leave or alter there involvement in the job. Guilt and shame. They know what they are doing is wrong, yet they make the conscience decision to to help the bad along. Those with a conscience will reflect on their actions, while those without will continue without remorse. I would like to mention one more place in the video before I move on. This begins happening at the 54 minute mark. Here, the subject of jury nullification is brought up. They speak of this for over 12 minutes and through 2 questioners. I know the lawyers are not allowed to say it, but Mazza was on his own. I wonder what happened that he never let the cat out of the bag. It is for sure they were given an opportunity to use the first amendment to state their cases, and that is a major coup, but you really need to take a look at why the judge might have allowed this. I believe this was his plan the whole time. It either was his plan, or someone put the pressure on him to not allow it in deliberations. In either situation, it was allowed and the jury heard it and from that jury came three new volunteers for the planet. Tim did give an interview yesterday on Your Call Radio.org. In it, he talked about his experiences in prison. No big surprise here. He has as much time behind bars as I do. I could tell that Tim understood what it is that I have been fighting for over 20 years now. Perhaps this knowledge of his, plus these lessons of mine, will help him with his next court case. One thing that caught my attention in that interview was when at around the 43 minute mark he explains why he was prosecuted. He says that it was because he exorcised his first amendment right and was speaking of the arrest all over the place. It was because of that. It was because he freely spoke that the government boys decided to go after him. Here is how I would handle the case of the Delta5 and their next action. First, you can appeal. I might even petition for writ of Certiori in the appeals court. I would state that the judge violated your first amendment right to free speech when attempting to state your defense. Contact me. Another action. That is what you should be planing next. Hell no, you plan another action. A better action then the last. An action and a plan better then what you thought your best was. You go back to the scene of the crime. You go back and do the same action. Only this time you do it with a plan. One thing you could do is see if any of the track is on public land and not private land, if they allow for that kind of thing. If they do, send a group to block the train at that point and take the arrests. Now before you go and do any of this, you have to have a lot of people. Five will not do. There has to be a large number of people from all walks of life. Then you divide them up and tailor each defense for each. You have to study all my stuff before you can do that, or hire me. When you get arrested you get arrested with all kinds of literature on you. You get arrested with FIJA forms, articles on the environment and oil bomb trains because when you get arrested it all becomes evidence in your case. The jury would have no other option but to go over it. Have videos of each future defendant giving a statement. Your action is not to bring awareness to the masses, nor to block a train, well, it is about blocking a train, but that is not your intent. You make sure you let the court know that your intent was for the lawmakers to make laws prohibiting these trains from traveling by populated places. You should know the rest by now. You should know if you want to bring arms, or if you want it to end this part of the action as quickly as the first one ended. Those jury members who were too scared to do the right thing and not convict you, will now be on your side. Besides them teaching you all how to be better defendants, they will be defendants themselves and will be testifying of their experience on the first jury and how they got into this and yadda, yadda, yadda, you know where to go with this. I have trust in Tim, always have. And one person will have a bench trial with Judge Howard, placing the burden of proof on him. You should all be able to figure this out. I have connected the dots quite comprehensively here. Now you know what you are really up against. Sorry bout that. But now you know and you will be able to fight more prepared. I have way too much work to get involved with these cases other then what I have written so far and that I will be monitoring the Delta5 and the Montrose9 twitter sites. I have many months of work ahead of me if we are to win this revolution, this liberation. That is if I decide to finish. It appears that you are all afraid of the truth and with that it is hard to ever convince anyone of what really needs to be done. No, but I would work with the CDC planing an action like this...if they asked and depending on their power system - lawyers and what they could do to speed up my work. They can contact me here.

And within that scientific community, the small group of international theoretical physicists with whom I have spent my working life might sometimes be tempted to regard themselves as the pinnacle. In addition to this, with the celebrity that has come with my books, and the isolation imposed by my illness, I feel as though my ivory tower is getting taller. So the recent apparent rejection of the elites in both America and Britain is surely aimed at me, as much as anyone. Whatever we might think about the decision by the British electorate to reject membership of the European Union and by the American public to embrace Donald Trump as their next president, there is no doubt in the minds of commentators that this was a cry of anger by people who felt they had been abandoned by their leaders. It was, everyone seems to agree, the moment when the forgotten spoke, finding their voices to reject the advice and guidance of experts and the elite everywhere. What matters now, far more than the victories by Brexit and Trump, is how the elites react I am no exception to this rule. What matters now, far more than the choices made by these two electorates, is how the elites react. I would argue that this would be a terrible mistake. The concerns underlying these votes about the economic consequences of globalisation and accelerating technological change are absolutely understandable. The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining. This in turn will accelerate the already widening economic inequality around the world. The internet and the platforms that it makes possible allow very small groups of individuals to make enormous profits while employing very few people. This is inevitable, it is progress, but it is also socially destructive. We need to put this alongside the financial crash, which brought home to people that a very few individuals working in the financial sector can accrue huge rewards and that the rest of us underwrite that success and pick up the bill when their greed leads us astray. So taken together we are living in a world of widening, not diminishing, financial inequality, in which many people can see not just their standard of living, but their ability to earn a living at all, disappearing. It is no wonder then that they are searching for a new deal, which Trump and Brexit might have appeared to represent. Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer It is also the case that another unintended consequence of the global spread of the internet and social media is that the stark nature of these inequalities is far more apparent than it has been in the past. For me, the ability to use technology to communicate has been a liberating and positive experience. Without it, I would not have been able to continue working these many years past. But it also means that the lives of the richest people in the most prosperous parts of the world are agonisingly visible to anyone, however poor, who has access to a phone. And since there are now more people with a telephone than access to clean water in sub-Saharan Africa, this will shortly mean nearly everyone on our increasingly crowded planet will not be able to escape the inequality. The consequences of this are plain to see: the rural poor flock to cities, to shanty towns, driven by hope. And then often, finding that the Instagram nirvana is not available there, they seek it overseas, joining the ever greater numbers of economic migrants in search of a better life. These migrants in turn place new demands on the infrastructures and economies of the countries in which they arrive, undermining tolerance and further fuelling political populism. We face awesome environmental challenges: climate change, food production, overpopulation, the decimation of other species, epidemic disease, acidification of the oceans. Together, they are a reminder that we are at the most dangerous moment in the development of humanity. We now have the technology to destroy the planet on which we live, but have not yet developed the ability to escape it. Perhaps in a few hundred years, we will have established human colonies amid the stars, but right now we only have one planet, and we need to work together to protect it. To do that, we need to break down, not build up, barriers within and between nations. With resources increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few, we are going to have to learn to share far more than at present. With not only jobs but entire industries disappearing, we must help people to retrain for a new world and support them financially while they do so. If communities and economies cannot cope with current levels of migration, we must do more to encourage global development, as that is the only way that the migratory millions will be persuaded to seek their future at home. We can do this, I am an enormous optimist for my species; but it will require the elites, from London to Harvard, from Cambridge to Hollywood, to learn the lessons of the past year.

And we learned about the critical importance of propaganda, the deliberate misinforming of the public in order to sway opinions en masse and achieve popular support (or at least the appearance of it). Post-war scholars of totalitarianism like Theodor Adorno and Hannah Arendt asked that question over and over, for several decades afterward. Their earliest studies on the subject looked at two sides of the equation. Adorno contributed to a massive volume of social psychology called The Authoritarian Personality, which studied individuals predisposed to the appeals of totalitarianism. The totalitarian mass leaders based their propaganda on the correct psychological assumption that, under such conditions, one could make people believe the most fantastic statements one day, and trust that if the next day they were given irrefutable proof of their falsehood, they would take refuge in cynicism; instead of deserting the leaders who had lied to them, they would protest that they had known all along that the statement was a lie and would admire the leaders for their superior tactical cleverness. The epistemological ground thus pulled out from under them, most would depend on whatever the leader said, no matter its relation to truth. Arendt's analysis of propaganda and the function of lies seems particularly relevant at this moment. We might begin to think they are an irrelevant sideshow. This, she suggests, would be a mistake.

Reply Mike Flores says: April 30, 2018 at 9:51 pm Interesting but flawed article. Propaganda just means, persuasion. It is part of psychological warfare. The best propaganda is the truth. Anyone who looks up Hitler on the internet will quickly discover there is no comparison. No private paramilitary group, no forced sterilization of enemies, etc. It is very hard to argue against that. It has enough truth to make it hard to argue against. There was no propaganda that could hide what was being done. Word would get back to families in Germany. No propaganda could cover that up. Word did trickle back to Germans from guards, but the guards were mostly ex communists who had joined the SA and then were folded into the SS. As communists they had read Marx and Engels on the necessity of wiping out the Slavic race and to kill practicing Jews. Marx and Engels wrote this material for years, for example saying all Slavic people should be killed to make way for the German worker. They had these beliefs before they became nazis. German society already had laws aimed against Jews. Propaganda did not create that. Religion did. Jews were blamed by the Catholic Church for killing a God. So this was taught people as children long before Hitler came to power. It was taught to Hitler too. Hitler by the way, was both Catholic and a follower of Hegel. Marx and Engels promoted the idea. The mindset was already there. Yet he refused to meet with Jesse Owens, the Project M files have been revealed so we know he believed in eugenics and the inferiority of Jews. Let me explain. Woodrow had strokes and was in various forms of incompetence which his wife, Edith our first female President, hid from everyone. You broke the window, you pay for it. Had Edith told advisers what Woodrow was going through I doubt that would have been included. Had Germany won World War 1, there would be an Irish Republic. No treaty so no economic collapse. No collapse no rise of the left in Germany. Franco would not have been put in place by the British. No World War 2 so no 70 million dead. an irony of history. Propaganda does not create history. Saying it does, is bad propaganda. Reply Thom McCann says: July 19, 2018 at 10:43 am Be afraid. Be very much afraid.

He famously joked in a college commencement address in 2009 at at Arizona State University that he could use the IRS to target political enemies but of course he never would. Not a single written document signed by Hitler has ever been found authorizing the SS murderers to wipe out Untermenschen or to killing foreign slave workers or Jews in concentration death camps or by starving them or working them to death. No direct order was given, but the courtiers sensed what would please their king. Just curious. I know people like you and it will not gonna happen.

I think the police state and the Evil Corporation (DAPL) wants us to dwell on the abuse they inflicted upon us. But that was not what I was focusing on. I saw hundreds and thousands of people who were so committed to fighting for what is right that they put their own personal safety and health in jeopardy over and over again. It was below freezing last night, the icy wind blows constantly causing your face to dry out and freeze. Just being out in the night air as the sun begins to set is very unpleasant and not for the weak. No matter how many layers of clothing or socks I wore it only took an hour or two before I was dreaming of a warm fire and my sleeping bag. But last night as the temperature dipped into the teens, water protectors stood out in the cold as a small group of them began to clear the 1806 road of debris in order to re-open the road (this is the road where another standoff occurred a few weeks ago as water protectors attempted to stop DAPL from desecrating graves and sacred sites on behalf of the Standing Rock tribe and were attacked by DAPL security and attack dogs). They planned to use this blockade in order to prevent the media and citizen observers from monitoring the actions of this criminal corporation in an attempt to ensure it can continue to destroy the environment with impunity. They also used this blockade to cause the locals to blame the water protectors for their personal inconvenience as they traveled an extra hour to avoid the blockade. There was no real reason that the 1806 road had to be blocked and rendered unusable by travelers. DAPL and the State benefited from the increased animosity of the ranchers and locals toward the water protectors; they benefit from pitting the local people who will be most impacted when their drinking water is destroyed, against those people who gave up their jobs, their comforts, their normal lives to come and try to protect the water that serves those locals. Clearing Road 1806 was long overdue. The State and DAPL should have cleared it weeks ago. Obviously they were not going to do so. And so once again Water Protectors were forced to act in the public interest. All they were going to do was pull those two trucks to the side of the road. The road that the public uses to travel upon on a daily basis. The other thing I saw were hundreds and thousands of water protectors helping each other and acting like a true resistance movement. I saw medics sacrificing themselves to help people who were overcome with tear gas or were suffering from hypothermia from the freezing water canons that relentlessly fired into the crowd. I watched water protectors helping the medics and their patients when the police intentionally fired tear gas canisters at the areas where medics were attending to injured people. How weak and pathetic those cops were, and how strong our people are. I watched water protector vehicles work like a well-trained rescue group shuttling people in and out of what looked like a war zone. I watched water protectors at camp create big warming fires, locate hundreds of blankets and towels, and help those who were literally frozen in their clothing get warm and save them from the suffering cold. I watched people take care of each other. I watched unprecedented dedication to the cause and of equal importance, to each other. I never saw a single ambulance or EMT even inquire as to the harm the State caused to human beings at Standing Rock. Last night the State may have thought they won the battle of the Backwater Bridge. They are wrong. I am so honored to be playing a tiny part in this resistance movement. And although Standing Rock and the water protectors will continue to fight regardless of our lawsuits, I believe it is important to make it clear that State actions like what we saw last night are not only illegal. They are morally indefensible. Those actions have no place in a so called free democracy. If we do not hold them accountable for their crimes, they will continue to perpetuate them on others.

After all, there is a virtue in gathering with family and friends one day a year to eat a lot and share company, if you remove the historic significance. Those who do care have been vocal about supporting the fight for clean water preservation at Standing Rock, North Dakota, an opposition by water protectors, Native Americas and non-Native people, that has waged on for seven months. Last Sunday night it grew still worse when 400 people were teargassed and sprayed with freezing water from powerful hoses. Still, it can be damaging to share the realities of a genocidal story with young children. Instead, for each of the past two years, in coincidence with these school lessons and plays, I have donned my tribal regalia, as have my school-age children. I visit their classrooms and share elements of Native American culture, food and agriculture with curious minds, as my mother and elder relatives did for my elementary classes. In this way, I enforce a presence of gratitude, something all children can understand and benefit positively from. In Native American Heritage Month, it seems a good time to recognize not only the legacy of Native people and how we continue to survive but also how our approach to treating our Earth is the only way civilization as a whole will remain. As the stewards of the land, the water and the sky, Native Americans have great historical lessons to teach of kindness, of respect, of temperance. I would argue that these are lessons for all people on Thanksgiving Day. My song will make it so. . . . When she grows far past her self-considered purpose, I will sing her back, sing her back.

LaBeau helps re-strike a teepee at the Oceti Sakowin camp on Nov. 15 in preparation for the winter. On that May afternoon, while Kane lay in the grass licking ice cream, a small white puppy playfully gnawed at her bare toes. She felt an overwhelming feeling of serenity, tinged with the knowledge that things would soon change drastically. She was right. In the next three months, violence would escalate while police and private security contractors would implement brutal tactics against protesters. In November, many people around the country were shocked to wake up to headlines about authorities using water cannons on protesters in below-freezing temperatures. She has long since stopped worrying about what she might face each day as she wakes up anew at the Oceti Sakowin camp, where she now lives just outside the Standing Rock reservation in a traditional Mongolian hut called a yurt that was recently donated. Kane is a member of the Miwok tribe. She was a Creative Loafing contributor in Charlotte before co-founding The PPL, a grassroots home for independent media, in the lead-up to the 2012 Democratic National Convention. She later moved to Arizona to produce documentaries for Vice News and most recently lived in Denver before going to Standing Rock reservation in May to help with communication training for water protectors. She left after completing that training, but soon answered a call to return and has been at the camp since. Speaking over the phone, she says she felt it was her duty to be there in a supportive role for the tribes whose water sources would be affected by the construction of the pipeline, which will travel under a nearby lake used by the Standing Rock Sioux and other Lakota tribes as a main water source. But what's always alarming is the level in which they're willing to go to harm us, especially being unarmed. We never expect to hear stories about police smiling in people's faces while simultaneously shooting them with rubber bullets in their kneecaps, or dumping water on people. She says she and other water protectors haven't had a chance to register what they've been through, but she's concerned with how the experiences will affect her later. Despite the hardships, Kane continues to get back on the horse, quite literally in one instance early in her stay in which she hurt her arm after being bucked from a bronco that had just been broken from the wild three days earlier. There was one experience, for example, in which two indigenous women, one a lesbian, presented for show the musket and flag captured during Custer's Last Stand. The mixed symbolism between history and progress in that moment stuck with Kane. Eric Schwabel The Oceti Sakowin camp at night. The lights in the distance are the pipeline construction site. From Charlotte, it can feel tough to make a difference in what's happening 1,600 miles away at the Standing Rock camps. Some Charlotte activists have made the trip to North Dakota to stand in support with water protectors, while others in the area have donated money and needed materials. Around Halloween, more than 1 million Facebook users around the country used the site to check in at Standing Rock thanks to a viral post claiming it would help confuse police who were targeting organizers on the ground there. That turned out not to be true, but did act as a symbolic show of support for those peacefully resisting the construction of the pipeline. Linda Simthong, founder of School of Jai, began planning the event after seeing videos of water protectors being brutalized online and on television. While Simthong is connected in those communities, she is not connected with the local indigenous community, so she reached out to make sure she would be helping the right people. She began to get council from a friend in Arizona who knew people on the ground at the protest site, then started hearing from people nearby. She has since been in talks with the Metrolina Native American Association as well as water protectors at Standing Rock, who have told her that Oceti Sakowin would be the best camp in which to funnel funding. Kane said people at the camp are currently in need of gear to survive the coming cold, but emphasized that people could also help in ways that didn't put a strain on their own time or resources. We have influence through our money. The most tangible and helpful thing people can do besides sending material support and sponsoring indigenous organizers is to pull their money out of the banks. Use a credit union. In the short term, however, funds and materials are needed now at Standing Rock reservation more than ever, and new threats have arisen that make it unclear whether the Oceti Sakowin camp will be around by the time Simthong throws her party. As folks at the camp prepared for an oncoming blizzard, they recently faced two eviction notices coming within days of each other; first from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers then from North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple. Garrett Ammesmaki Water protectors in the Oceti Sakowin camp prepare hay that will be used for insulation during the coming winter. The camp is on disputed land, as the government claims it's federally owned but leased for grazing, while the Standing Rock Sioux point out that they own the land by right of the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty. The letter says the land will be closed on Dec. 5, leading many to speculate that authorities would forcibly remove any water protectors who hadn't left by that date. On Sunday, however the Army Corps released a new statement stating that won't be the case. The Dec. 5 ultimatum coincides with plans by two veterans to deploy a force of hundreds of veterans to the Standing Rock reservation to join water protectors and prevent further progress on the pipeline. Wesley Clark Jr., and Michael Wood Jr., plan to arrive at the site with between 500 and 2,000 other veterans on Dec. 4 then lead an action of peaceful resistance on Dec. 5, the day the Oceti Sakowin camp will be officially closed. On Monday, Dalrymple took things a step further, ordering the mandatory evacuation of all water protectors on federally owned land. The governor cited the oncoming weather hazards and said he is taking action for the well-being of activists. As of CL's print deadline, Dalrymple had not specified how he planned to carry out the order, which states that no state agencies, emergency service officials or nongovernmental organizations will be offering emergency provisions in the evacutation area. Spokespeople for the Standing Rock Sioux have pointed out the hypocrisy of implying that authorities are worried about the water protectors' well-being after spending weeks blasting them with water cannons in below-freezing temperatures. The protesters have stood firm in stating they will remain where they are as fears grow of a forced removal taking place during harsh winter conditions in the upcoming weekend. That is our camp. It can be hard to reach Kane at the Oceti Sakowin camp, as her already-busy camp life has only accelerated in preparation for the oncoming storm. On Monday, following news of the Army Corps ultimatum and preceding the governor's evacuation order, I reached out through text message to get her thoughtson the impending deadline. Her answer, while blunt, showed that the resolve she showed during our original conversation a few days before hadn't left her or her campmates.

Grzywa feels the two organizers of the Veterans Standing for Standing Rock took him and other former members of the military for a ride.

Grzywa says many of his brothers have not received the promised reimbursement from a Go Fund Me account that was set up for that purpose. Another of Grzywa's points of contention comes from an apology that Wes Clark, Junior one of the other organizers made on behalf of all veterans.

Indeed, to attain the desired path for Dakota Access, Energy Transfer Partners was able to take land from reluctant private property owners through eminent domain. However, it was becoming increasingly clear he was punting this issue down the road. Roads, bridges, transmission lines, pipelines, wind farms and water lines will be very difficult, if not impossible, to build when criminal behavior is rewarded this way. In my conversation with Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy today, she was unable to give any legal reasons for the decision and could not answer any questions about rerouting the pipeline. I feel badly for the Corps of Engineers because of the diligent work it did on this project, only to have their Commander-in-Chief throw them under the bus. Others quickly joined the tirade.

But soon those police actions will be closer to home and more pressing for all of us. States have been quietly enacting legislation that serves to strengthen the power of police officers and change the language that defines a protest. But the right to peaceably assemble is just as important, if not more important because it allows every individual to have equal input. People across the country have recently been moved to action by the 2016 Presidential Campaign and subsequent election to vocalize their concerns. These efforts have been rewarded with increased visibility for causes that affect the most vulnerable. The immediate judicial response shows the power and importance of protesting as a means of making sure the voice of the people is heard. In a time where the influence of money in politics has overshadowed the will of the populace, the right to protest is arguably the last defense left to us. Placing stiff penalties on those who participate, essentially narrowing the definition of protesting by labeling certain actions as dangerous thus giving way for more police intervention.

Haaland is a citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna tribe and one of a record number of Native American women running for office this year. The daughter of military veterans, Haaland attended 13 schools before she graduated high school. To pay her way through college, she decorated cakes and started a salsa business. She earned a law degree while raising a daughter as a single mother and working part time at an antique auction shop. At times, her family relied on food stamps, a reality she said many New Mexicans face as the state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country. She also supports calls to eliminate the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agency and to impeach Trump. If she wins, Haaland says her top priorities in Washington would be protecting the environment and growing a clean energy economy. She would also fight for more funding and resources to combat violence against women, a scourge that disproportionately affects Native women. Political analysts view it as safely Democratic. Hillary Clinton won the district by more than 16 percentage points and Democrats have held the seat since 2009. Haaland is part of a broader trend of Native Americans increasingly running for national office, after centuries of systematic persecution, marginalization and disenfranchisement. The United States did not grant citizenship to Native people until 1924. There are currently only two members of Congress who are Native American: the Oklahoma Republicans Tom Cole and Markwayne Mullin. Sharice Davids, a member of the Ho-Chunk nation, is running in a competitive Democratic primary in a swing district in Kansas, and Amanda Douglas, a member of the Cherokee nation, advanced to a runoff election in the Democratic primary for a deeply conservative Oklahoma congressional district. She worked for years in Democratic politics before an unsuccessful bid for lieutenant governor in 2014. She then served as the state party chair. She sailed past her opponents in what was expected to be a competitive race by turning out a coalition of progressive voters that agreed with her on issues such as climate and healthcare.

Over 280 tribes and thousands of non-native volunteers have gathered to protect the Sioux's ancestral water supply, which they believe will be poisoned when the North Dakota Access Pipeline inevitably leaks. Most of the coverage you've seen has probably come in the form of Twitter and Facebook rage-screaming in all-caps gibberish, or it looks like this: The Guardian That vague title leaves a lot open to interpretation. And if the internet has taught us anything, it's that interpretation is not the average person's strong suit ... or even their medium suit, for that matter. Reading that headline makes the story sound identical to every other protest of the last 20 years. Continue Reading Below Advertisement It would be easy for me to make a snide joke here about people crafting bumper-sticker-sized commentaries about a protest as high-profile as this, but Twitter is way more important than you might realize. See, Standing Rock wouldn't still be here if it wasn't for social media. The main camp is a huge, sprawling 5,000 person campout. One that runs off its own renewable power, offers free coffee 24 hours a day, and manages to feed and provide emergency care for its thousands of volunteers. The main camp area has become a makeshift city -- though not one you're likely to hear an annoying, pandering pop song about. Take me down to the Protest City, where there is no grass but counseling tipis. We met carload after carload of those volunteers, and the critical supplies they brought to camp, like firewood and things to wipe your butt with that isn't firewood. Which is both awe-inspiring and cartoonishly surreal. And now, keeping in mind everything I've told you so far, here's where things get crazy. Governments always have weapons -- the people only have each other, and occasionally Molotov cocktails. That's why the Egyptian government tried to fight the protests in 2011 by cutting off the entire nation's internet access, and why Turkey's new sorta-dictator Recep Tayyip Erdogan attempted to block Twitter access in his country. So maybe it's not surprising that someone is trying to kick Standing Rock off the internet. (And yes, we've got evidence to back us up. We first encountered the idea through hearsay, via a man we met at the big camp, in a large tent filled with U.S. military veterans. He'd been a 25 Bravo in the Army -- an information technology specialist. In any other situation, we'd have been prepared to write this off as the world's lamest campfire story. But ... We ran into similar strange rumors across camp for the next couple of days. People from every corner, whether they had been on site for days or for months, would talk about their cellphone signals cutting out just as drones circled above. Mobiles would switch themselves off and on again -- not in pocket but in hand. Camera apps were opened out of nowhere, and batteries would drain by enormous percentages, killing the phones in minutes, rather than the steady decline of any device pinging back and forth searching for a signal. There were even reports of people's Gmail accounts being hacked. We were unable to even Instagram this picture of our morning coffee. We brought all this -- the cell-blocking and reports of weird phone activity -- up to Marc Rogers, a security expert and white-hat hacker who, among other things, advises the show Mr. Robot. This allows the authorities to track people without using their GPS data, and thus without one of those pesky warrants. Other cell site simulators, like a DRT box, or dirtbox, are capable of decrypting data and voice calls from any phone that connects to them. These devices are also capable of booting protesters off the internet. Most of the time, it happens by accident. All they have to do is broadcast a cell tower with a stronger signal than the legitimate towers. But they certainly have the capability. Chicago and Los Angeles police have had dirtboxes for more than a decade. A number of U.S. police departments have purchased Stingrays in the past few years. Since these cell site simulators can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, they're often donated to local PDs by the FBI or the corporations that make them. A Stingray was most recently used by the Baltimore police to disrupt the protests after Freddie Gray's death. So it's not like John Law is averse to blocking people's data via techno-fuckery. And sometimes they do it with planes, because if you're going to do shit like this, you might as well do it in the scariest way possible. Continue Reading Below Advertisement In 2014, The Wall Street Journal broke the story that the U.S. Marshals Service had commissioned a fleet of fixed-wing aircraft with dirtboxes. And no, this information isn't from some website with an Illuminati pyramid worked into the logo; the AP figured this out, and they've provided so much documentation that anyone who reads it will literally shit credibility. Continue Reading Below Advertisement Marc made sure to note that a number of things could have caused all this funky phone behavior. Our stories were all anecdotal, and conspiratorial thinking is going to thrive at any given gathering of thousands of people who regularly contend with armed riot police. And while a handful of other sites have reported on rumors of digital eavesdropping at Standing Rock, and the ACLU has submitted a freedom of information request looking into the matter, solid evidence has been in short supply. They gave each of us a rundown of the camp's rules. Eventually press liaison Michael Penuelas explained that the open WiFi networks were basically a honeypot. Those who connected would discover that their email passwords had been changed and they were temporarily locked out of their accounts. Open WiFi is possible to spoof fairly simply, using legitimate-looking portals to collect any entered data, like email addresses and passwords. Setting up an attack can be as easy as hiding a device in a desired location and waiting for people to connect. Michael referred us to a pair of cybersecurity experts from NYU who'd been gathering data on all this for a while. ARP-spoofing like this can be used to simply stop service, or to conduct a man in the middle attack. No condom. No cab fare home. Just a raw, unapologetic cyber dick-down. Continue Reading Below Advertisement Continue Reading Below Advertisement This is a Wireshark simulation of what he observed in the midst of one such attack, based on the data he gathered at the time. It suggests that something funky is happening and that digital war zone photography probably won't ever win a Pulitzer. Chuck noted that an open hot spot appeared as soon as the attack commenced. A lookup of the plane's registration data shows it belonging to the Nebraska Highway Patrol. He's in the process of filing a Freedom of Information request to see those logs. But Chuck took data on other planes in the sky during his visit. One of them was registered to the North Dakota Highway Patrol, and one was registered to the North Dakota Fish & Game Department. Both of the others are weird. And this Cessna was listed as being owned by the Nebraska State Patrol: Federal Aviation Administration Continue Reading Below Advertisement Now, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota are NOT known to employ Stingray-style technology. Most of these planes may just be for visual surveillance. It's worth noting, though, that all these out-of-state planes are Cessna T206H's, the same model the FBI prefers to load up with Dirtboxes. We've included Chuck Justice's data in this article, because we've really got to get back to writing about Back To The Future. This feels like the kind of problem that could use some Ruffalo.

But amid all the movement, that moment stayed with me. I had come with a group of Catholic Workers for reasons anyone studying or teaching theology as I do might find obvious. The violation of basic dignity happening here defies the consistent refrain by the prophets and Jesus to do justice with an eye toward the exploited. We had been told white bodies could help by surrounding native ones, shielding them while they sought to protect their water. Its most recent manifestation is this pipeline. I have meditated on that profession of love several days ago from a grown man wielding a bat to threaten us. After our class argued over how we might know when these frictions came to possess the machinery of government, one student declared emphatically that if we could not already recognize that the friction had taken over, then we would never see it. It was hard to disagree, especially the day after our encounter with the pipeline workers when the police pepper sprayed a Lakota prayer service and those of us surrounding it, arresting whom they could. The idea directly influenced Gandhi and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who added their own positive notions to resistance. Gandhi insisted that more than ahimsa (the Sanskrit word for causing no harm) was needed in the Indian independence movement. We ought to ask ourselves whether Thoreau was right. But some white allies who had joined their struggle, quite understandably, held no love for those who might mace them midprayer without warning. There was no clear consensus on the parameters for civil disobedience. Of course, it is not for others to dictate to the Lakota how to protect their water. And if the law of the machine, a law of military and economic profit, enacted by generals and tycoons, must be broken in favor of the needs of man, let the law be broken. I still churn that moment over in my mind: A man threatening us with a baseball bat told us he loved us. Despite the presence of agape, love between people who had never even met before, we had already organized ourselves in a violent way that ruptured any chance for human community. It seems clear that the moment for resistance had come too late, that something was allowed to flourish that never should have had the chance to sprout. Lines were drawn centuries ago, were never erased, and we had simply stepped into ready-made roles. We loved one another, but a system was in place encouraging hatred, and we could only navigate it awkwardly and poorly.

What makes them trumps is not what they believe, but how they believe it. They hold on to their beliefs like know-it-alls, with a lock-tight grip shrouded in multiple layers of seemingly impenetrable, defensive, Teflon-coated armor that allows them to act like they're right about everything, and everyone else is wrong about everything. There are chinks in that armor. You just have to know how to find them. Here are some factors to consider. 1. Not fighting is a good idea when possible. You may be able to subdue them, which is why sometimes it's worth trying. In such cases, play to your audience and not the trump. But also, pay attention to the costs of having an audience. Trump typically mistake fake reasons for real reasons. It can be stated in the form of a variation on the serenity prayer: Grant me the patience to reason with the receptive, the impatience to give up on the unreceptive, and the wisdom to know the difference. You need the wisdom, because reasoning with the unreceptive and not reasoning with the receptive will both leave you feeling dirty. They would prefer you believe they are reasonable, but short of that, they're happy enough to keep you in doubt. Just do your best to guess carefully. 6. Fight fire with fire: If you decide someone is a trump, shift attention to a higher moral goal: Making her leave the engagement disappointed. Drop your concerns about being kind, receptive, generous or giving her the benefit of the doubt. In the service of that higher goal, be ready to fight fire with fire, to go after her cunningly with whatever it takes to shake her. Don't try to shame her morally. She's proud of her naughty-girl immorality. To her, it's a badge of honor. And don't hold yourself to the same moral standard you set for dealing with the reasonable. This is different. 7. Be tenacious: Trumps win debates by controlling them. Indeed, the Donald controlled the debate seamlessly throughout the campaign season. Never once did he let someone else decide what he would talk about or set the ground rules for the debate. If you try to stay honorable by responding to a trump's questions and challenges, he'll whip you around like bull whips a bull rider. Pick a point and stick with it. Never let him off the hook. If he asks questions (which are more like attacks dressed up as questions) ignore it and ask a question back. Pretend he never asked you and keep on him about how he refuses to answer your question. 8. Mark your place: Trumps are slippery. Instead, play it up a level, character assassination for character assassination. The trump will likely reinforce your argument by responding in a way that confirms your accusation. 10. Recognize that the trump is familiar with them all and is fully loaded with his know-it-all reactions. So you have to out-maneuver him, hitting him with surprising responses. To make any communication effective, you need discipline. Nowhere is that more important than with a trump. 11. Murmur truth to power: The know-it-all sets you up to get agitated and unstable. That way she disqualifies you for getting emotional. Stay calm, confident, laconic, laid back, even glib. Keep breathing. Let her talk and talk little. The less you say, the less of a surface you present for her to pick apart with her know-it-all formula. Master communicators know not to lean into a conflict. Leaning back forces the other person to lean in off her grounded center. Simply assume that he is, and go from there. He will likely try to defend himself, arguing that he isn't a know-it-all, which puts him on the defensive. 13. Give them a taste of their medicine: Follow their logic and pretend you embrace their assumptions. You're one of those no-compromise, look-out-for-number-one guys. It's a dog-eat-dog world and you'll be damned if you're going to tie your hands by compromising to accommodate others. That's why you support Trump. He's your kind of guy. Nothing matters but winning the game. They're fighting two battles, to win and stay politically correct. You're just fighting to win. Anyone could make it. 15. Argue like it's 2020: We learned something very important in this election: Many Americans can't distinguish between opinions and reality. For these gullible Americans, the real test of honesty is insistence. To them, the more insistent you are in your opinions, the more honest you are about reality. Which is total BS of course. So don't play into it. Don't let someone think he can win a debate through insistence and don't try to out-insist him. Calmly note that only time will tell. Reality wins all debates in the end. You and he are placing different bets about how reality will play out. None of these approaches guarantee success. They are all just attempts to address the number-one challenge in our public and private lives. We recommend moving this block and the preceding CSS link to the HEAD of your HTML file.

(Photo: Johnny Dangers) Thanksgiving angst has hit new highs this week, and with good reason. White nationalism is on the rise and with each passing day, Donald Trump still exists. Since last spring, more than 200 Indigenous nations have converged in Standing Rock to resist construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, and in keeping with US tradition, law enforcement has waged war against those peoples. Water Protectors have been battered, tortured, tear gassed, struck with concussion grenades and shot down with rubber bullets. They have been terrorized with the constant noise of low-flying planes and the buzz of surveillance drones. I appreciate that pause. After all, these lies have always been an insult to our collective intelligence. Abraham Lincoln made Thanksgiving a national holiday during the Civil War, for the sake of public morale. Thanksgiving as a happy dinner day between pilgrims and Indians provides a fluffy historic cover for genocide. I intend to enjoy it myself. I know that many Natives treat Thanksgiving as a Day of Mourning, and I respect that. If people choose to join that practice in solidarity, I respect that as well. But for myself, as a Native woman who organizes against state violence, I feel I spend enough of my time mourning for both the past and the present. I choose to resist the lies of this holiday, as constructed, by holding people close who would never support its fictions, and by cherishing the work they do and the community they build. On this day, some of my friends will find themselves in Standing Rock for the first time. Most travelled with friends or family to act in solidarity with Native freedom fighters. They are spending this day with loved ones, but in a way that defies the legacy of genocide by embracing justice for Native people, and bearing witness to our stories as they unfold. To bear witness to what this system would erase is an act of resistance, and unrelenting, interconnected resistance is what is called for in these times. So I would offer to anyone feeling conflicted, or who simply wants to push back against the legacies of harm that are embedded in this holiday: Talk about Standing Rock today. Talk about what you can do about it. Encourage those you break bread with to donate if they can. Talk about what Native sovereignty and collective liberation might look like. Talk big.

He said he was hoping maybe a hundred would respond. But yesterday I joined thousands in a procession of faith leaders to gather around the sacred fire at the Oceti Sakowin Camp at Standing Rock. I knew something special was happening here. And in recent months, pipeline construction destroyed holy sites. But Native American tribes from some 200 nations came together here to protect their water and resist the Dakota Access Pipeline. Yesterday, they won. Continue reading at the Religion News Service.

In September, the 75-year-old senator was part of the protests against the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, which took place in front of the White House. In November, just a week after Election Day, Sanders participated in another pipeline protest outside of the White House, during which he said: What we have to tell Mr. Trump and everybody else: We are not going silently into the night. The stakes are too high for the future of this planet. You can read Sanders' Tuesday statement in full below: Millions of people came together all over this country to stop the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines and say we must transform our energy system away from fossil fuels to renewable energy. Today, President Trump ignored the voices of millions and put the short-term profits of the fossil fuel industry ahead of the future of our planet. At a time when the scientific community is virtually unanimous in telling us that climate change is real, it is caused by human activity and it is already causing devastating problems, we cannot afford to build new oil pipelines that lock us into burning fossil fuels for years to come. I will do everything I can to stop these pipelines and protect our planet for future generations. The Army announced in early December that it was halting construction of the final piece of the Dakota Access pipeline.

New Evidence of an Overall Collapse Recent studies show America at or near the bottom among developed countries in disposable income poverty, income and wealth inequality, safety net provisions, employment, economic mobility, life expectancy, infant mortality, and the well-being of children. We've run the table. The better part of America is equivalent to a third-world country. According to one careful study, they only have about half the chance that they had fifty years ago. Racist Gap-Widening Today just 100 individuals own as much wealth as the entire Black population of America. Even a middle-aged African-American with a graduate degree has only about the same odds of becoming a millionaire as a white person with a high school diploma. The common misperception is that Black youths turn to drugs at a disproportionate rate. Not true. Finding a Stable Job Is Becoming Impossible for Much of the US We keep hearing about the drop in the unemployment rate. But with nearly two out of every five American adults not even in the labor force, the unemployment rate is more like 30 percent. Two out of every five middle-class households (incomes between 80 and 125 percent of the median) have dropped to lower-class. According to Pew Research, median household expenses increased by about 25 percent between 1996 and 2014. Income hasn't budged. Young adults are living with parents to the greatest degree in the modern era, and now the parents themselves (people over 40) are moving back in with THEIR aging parents. Less fortunate Americans are 15 pounds heavier than in the 1990s, dying from alcoholism at a record rate, and struggling with mental health problems for which treatment facilities have been continually cut, leaving many mentally ill people in jails rather than in psychiatric hospitals. Finally, most disturbingly, we're living in an era of suicide in America, in parallel with our era of inequality. Suicide is at its highest level in 30 years. It's especially high for veterans. War is traumatic and depressing, but so is a return to a deteriorating nation. Only if the blurred and battered American Dream turns into a progressive 2020 Vision. Only if Americans get beyond their irrational fear of the word 'social' and begin to work together to dismantle the plutocracy that rules us.

Although most individuals are probably aware that criminals will often cruise through parking lots, looking to find a vehicle stuffed full of holiday presents, many cities are also falling victim to criminal activity.

Neil Young and his girlfriend, Daryl Hannah, published an open letter on Monday calling for President Barack Obama to do whatever he can to make sure authorities begin to treat the protestors at the Standing Rock Native American Reservation with decency and respect. In recent days, police have fired rubber bullets and water cannons at the protestors, who oppose building the Dakota Access Pipeline through the North Dakota reservation. Hundreds have been injured and more than 20 have been taken to hospitals as a result, according to The Intercept. Young has become one of the most famous celebrities to stand in public support of the protestors. On Nov. 12, the day of his 71st birthday, Young joined the protestors at Standing Rock to perform and bring attention to the issue. Young also said he would return to Standing Rock yet again, and issued a call to all people who stand in solidarity with the protestors in Standing Rock. Be counted. Be like our brothers and sisters at Standing Rock. Below you will find the letter in its entirety: Tales of a feast on Plymouth plantation in the Autumn of 1621, where of pilgrims from the Mayflower, celebrated the harvest, shared and broke bread with the first Americans are false. They are still used as inspiration and shared with children, teaching them the beauty of gratitude. But it is now widely understood this Thanksgiving story is a fictional history. It was invented to whitewash the vicious genocide wrought upon the native inhabitants of this magnificent continent. Not only did the Europeans try to eradicate native populations, but they made every effort to eviscerate their culture, their language and eliminate them from these coveted lands. From Plymouth Rock to Standing Rock, this lie has made our Thanksgiving Day a Day of Mourning for the First Nations, all the tribes big and small, those who came before us. A few weeks ago we traveled to visit the Standing Rock Sioux In North Dakota. We arrived at this unprecedented historical gathering of over five hundred tribes and thousands of others standing on the front lines to protect water, to state the most basic human truth, to say water is life. Despite the painful history, today they fight peacefully for us all. The camp grows as winter comes. Standing in protection of our most vital life support systems, but also for the rightful preservation of Native American cultural ways and their sovereignty. Everyone we talk with is committed to peaceful resistance. Weapons alcohol and drugs are forbidden there. This growing movement stems from love, it is the most human instinct to protect that which we love. An eager and engaged youth are at the core of this pipeline route resistance, learning from a population of elders who pass down unforgotten knowledge. It is an awakening. All here together, with their non-native relatives, standing strong in the face of outrageous, unnecessary and violent aggression, on the part of militarized local and state law enforcement agencies and National Guard, who are seemingly acting to protect the interests of the Dakota Access Pipeline profiteers, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of tax-payer dollars, above all other expressed concerns. They stand against corporate security forces, the county sheriff and the National Guard. Standing while being hit with water cannons, mace, tear gas, rubber bullets. Standing without weapons and praying, the water protectors endure human rights abuses in sub freezing temperatures. Supplies arrive from all over as the social media universe shares the heartbreaking news to the world, that an American corporate media is not free to report. Thus, it is the ugliness of corporate America, seen around the world. But they stand, their hair frozen from water cannons. They stand for all that is good and they stay strong. We are calling upon you, President Barack Obama, to step in and end the violence against the peaceful water protectors at Standing Rock immediately. We will be going back to support the water protectors again. Let us all stand with them in thanks, in appreciation for the ancient wisdom they carry, In thanks for this opportunity for true gratitude. For giving us a path forward. For trying to show us a road to survival. We offer our support and our respect. We hear the call to protect the water protectors to listen, learn and get engaged. They are brave. We thank them. And we can give thanks for the bounty. The great issues of our time are now brightly illuminated and people are becoming more aware of them than ever, from sea to shining sea, from Standing Rock to Wall Street. The surprise president elect was not the winner of the popular vote, does not have a mandate for the change of ideals envisioned. Keep in mind, close to over two million more people voted for another candidate. Nor is the surprise president the leader of the free world. Two hundred of the worlds nations believe in science, above the profits of the oil, gas and coal industries, and are committed to working together to protect the future from an unchecked climate crisis. The surprise president claims he does not believe in climate science nor the threats it presents and his actions and words reflect that claim in tangible and dangerous ways. Those who behave in racist ways are not your leaders. The golden tower is not yours. The White House is your house. Your growing activism in support of freedom over repression, addressing climate change, swiftly replacing a destructive old industries with safe, regenerative energy, encouraging wholistic thinking in balance with the future of our planet; that activism will strengthen and shed continued light on us all. These worthy goals must be met for the all the worlds children and theirs after them. This is our moment for truth. Unintimidated, stand, speak up and show up. Be counted.

Connect to your existing Cracked account if you have one or create a new Cracked username. Over 280 tribes and thousands of non-native volunteers have gathered to protect the Sioux's ancestral water supply, which they believe will be poisoned when the North Dakota Access Pipeline inevitably leaks. Most of the coverage you've seen has probably come in the form of Twitter and Facebook rage-screaming in all-caps gibberish, or it looks like this: The Guardian That vague title leaves a lot open to interpretation. And if the internet has taught us anything, it's that interpretation is not the average person's strong suit ... or even their medium suit, for that matter. Reading that headline makes the story sound identical to every other protest of the last 20 years. Continue Reading Below Advertisement It would be easy for me to make a snide joke here about people crafting bumper-sticker-sized commentaries about a protest as high-profile as this, but Twitter is way more important than you might realize. See, Standing Rock wouldn't still be here if it wasn't for social media. The main camp is a huge, sprawling 5,000 person campout. One that runs off its own renewable power, offers free coffee 24 hours a day, and manages to feed and provide emergency care for its thousands of volunteers. The main camp area has become a makeshift city -- though not one you're likely to hear an annoying, pandering pop song about. Take me down to the Protest City, where there is no grass but counseling tipis. We met carload after carload of those volunteers, and the critical supplies they brought to camp, like firewood and things to wipe your butt with that isn't firewood. Which is both awe-inspiring and cartoonishly surreal. And now, keeping in mind everything I've told you so far, here's where things get crazy. Governments always have weapons -- the people only have each other, and occasionally Molotov cocktails. That's why the Egyptian government tried to fight the protests in 2011 by cutting off the entire nation's internet access, and why Turkey's new sorta-dictator Recep Tayyip Erdogan attempted to block Twitter access in his country. So maybe it's not surprising that someone is trying to kick Standing Rock off the internet. (And yes, we've got evidence to back us up. We first encountered the idea through hearsay, via a man we met at the big camp, in a large tent filled with U.S. military veterans. He'd been a 25 Bravo in the Army -- an information technology specialist. In any other situation, we'd have been prepared to write this off as the world's lamest campfire story. But ... We ran into similar strange rumors across camp for the next couple of days. People from every corner, whether they had been on site for days or for months, would talk about their cellphone signals cutting out just as drones circled above. Mobiles would switch themselves off and on again -- not in pocket but in hand. Camera apps were opened out of nowhere, and batteries would drain by enormous percentages, killing the phones in minutes, rather than the steady decline of any device pinging back and forth searching for a signal. There were even reports of people's Gmail accounts being hacked. We were unable to even Instagram this picture of our morning coffee. We brought all this -- the cell-blocking and reports of weird phone activity -- up to Marc Rogers, a security expert and white-hat hacker who, among other things, advises the show Mr. Robot. This allows the authorities to track people without using their GPS data, and thus without one of those pesky warrants. Other cell site simulators, like a DRT box, or dirtbox, are capable of decrypting data and voice calls from any phone that connects to them. These devices are also capable of booting protesters off the internet. Most of the time, it happens by accident. All they have to do is broadcast a cell tower with a stronger signal than the legitimate towers. But they certainly have the capability. Chicago and Los Angeles police have had dirtboxes for more than a decade. A number of U.S. police departments have purchased Stingrays in the past few years. Since these cell site simulators can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, they're often donated to local PDs by the FBI or the corporations that make them. A Stingray was most recently used by the Baltimore police to disrupt the protests after Freddie Gray's death. So it's not like John Law is averse to blocking people's data via techno-fuckery. And sometimes they do it with planes, because if you're going to do shit like this, you might as well do it in the scariest way possible. Continue Reading Below Advertisement In 2014, The Wall Street Journal broke the story that the U.S. Marshals Service had commissioned a fleet of fixed-wing aircraft with dirtboxes. And no, this information isn't from some website with an Illuminati pyramid worked into the logo; the AP figured this out, and they've provided so much documentation that anyone who reads it will literally shit credibility. Continue Reading Below Advertisement Marc made sure to note that a number of things could have caused all this funky phone behavior. Our stories were all anecdotal, and conspiratorial thinking is going to thrive at any given gathering of thousands of people who regularly contend with armed riot police. And while a handful of other sites have reported on rumors of digital eavesdropping at Standing Rock, and the ACLU has submitted a freedom of information request looking into the matter, solid evidence has been in short supply. They gave each of us a rundown of the camp's rules. Eventually press liaison Michael Penuelas explained that the open WiFi networks were basically a honeypot. Those who connected would discover that their email passwords had been changed and they were temporarily locked out of their accounts. Open WiFi is possible to spoof fairly simply, using legitimate-looking portals to collect any entered data, like email addresses and passwords. Setting up an attack can be as easy as hiding a device in a desired location and waiting for people to connect. Michael referred us to a pair of cybersecurity experts from NYU who'd been gathering data on all this for a while. ARP-spoofing like this can be used to simply stop service, or to conduct a man in the middle attack. No condom. No cab fare home. Just a raw, unapologetic cyber dick-down. Continue Reading Below Advertisement Continue Reading Below Advertisement This is a Wireshark simulation of what he observed in the midst of one such attack, based on the data he gathered at the time. It suggests that something funky is happening and that digital war zone photography probably won't ever win a Pulitzer. Chuck noted that an open hot spot appeared as soon as the attack commenced. A lookup of the plane's registration data shows it belonging to the Nebraska Highway Patrol. He's in the process of filing a Freedom of Information request to see those logs. But Chuck took data on other planes in the sky during his visit. One of them was registered to the North Dakota Highway Patrol, and one was registered to the North Dakota Fish & Game Department. Both of the others are weird. And this Cessna was listed as being owned by the Nebraska State Patrol: Federal Aviation Administration Continue Reading Below Advertisement Now, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota are NOT known to employ Stingray-style technology. Most of these planes may just be for visual surveillance. It's worth noting, though, that all these out-of-state planes are Cessna T206H's, the same model the FBI prefers to load up with Dirtboxes. We've included Chuck Justice's data in this article, because we've really got to get back to writing about Back To The Future. This feels like the kind of problem that could use some Ruffalo.

There is smoke in the air this morning from sage and cedar burning on the sacred fire at the mouth of Oceti Sakowin. The tear gas has cleared from the air since the assault on water protectors by militarized police, the national guard and private contractors a few nights ago on the bridge on Highway 1806. OPINION: How the Fight for Water Unites Palestine and Dakota At Standing Rock, the weather drops below freezing at night, with frost collecting on the inside of the tents; cell phone signals are blocked or severely diminished across the camp, coupled with the dubious draining of cell phone batteries and erratic electronic function. It is very hard to get information out across the airwaves, even through a simple text message or phone call. Surveillance is high: helicopters fly low overhead, with crop dusters circling the camp every few hours and there is a distinct whir of company and camp drones all hours of the day and night. Today, however, songs of prayer and ceremony fill the air at the Sacred Fire and they almost drown out the noise of the engines overhead. Thingstaken morning. However, the real events of that day did not mark peace but marked the ongoing plague of settler-colonialism and genocide of the Indigenous people of the Americas. In the wake of first contact with the pilgrims and European explorers, peoples, things, cultures, and land, were all consequently diminished or exterminated. While many people, even those at Standing Rock, will participate in some sort of collective meal to mark the holiday, there are many who will be fasting and mourning. Dorothy Sun Bear of Wounded Knee, South Dakota has been running the Wild Ogalala kitchen with her family since August. She feeds hundreds of people a day but will be making a point to fast on Thingstaken. While others celebrate and cook, we should pray and fast. Tipi with portrait and quote of Sitting Bull on the side. Approximately 400 years have passed since the Pilgrims reached Plymouth Rock and began taking things from one America to build another. Many of the children and grandchildren of those who resisted colonization spoke about their journeys to Standing Rock, their purpose for remaining here and how the Seventh Generation of Indigenous youth can take their things back. He spoke of his purpose for arriving at the camp and for remaining in the struggle against DAPL. This is personal for me. My great-grandfather was chief gall of Standing Rock. I was lost until I came here. As Native youth, many of us have lost our way. We used to know ourselves and we need to know ourselves again. We are all connected. RELATED: Police Unleash Military-Style Assault on Standing Rock Protesters Many elders have returned to Standing Rock to support the protectors who are working tirelessly on the ground. Darlene Meguinis of the Blackfoot Nation, who was a key organizer in the Idle No More movement in Canada, told me that she came back to Standing Rock to support the elders, the youth and the Indigenous women on the frontlines of Indigenous empowerment and community building. She is not alone. Bettina Castagno of the Mohawk Nation came back to Standing Rock after her first visit in late summer to open up a small kitchen and community center in Oceti Sakowin. She was happy to see so many people returning to camp. You see them here, hugging. I want people to see how many different people are represented here, how many nations, spirits, traditions and languages. she commented. People jeered at me, called me names. Colonization did not stop with reservations and partitions, it continues today and is embodied in the blindness through which so many people in the U.S. celebrate Thanksgiving without acknowledgment of the histories and resilience of the people that were suppressed by that narrative of normalization. We know who we are and where we belong and it is here. When you are getting maced and beaten, sing your song. Though these threads of disempowerment persist nationally through structural, social, and political violence, Standing Rock has become too big to ignore. Today, on Thingstaken, a whole camp of peoples sing their songs, dance together and honor their continuation of life. RELATED: 'It's Not About Me, It's About Indigenous Peoples': Wilansky While many of us who are not Indigenous to Turtle Island, may be struggling around reframing a popularized colonial holiday, there are swaths of Indigenous people who heed no pause in reclaiming Thingstaken through education and narratives by and for Indigenous people. Mother Earth is grounding: she takes your pain and turns it into something powerful. The pain brought by DAPL is just the latest manifestation of the black snake. We must take care of Mother Earth and her people. For all of those with eyes on Standing Rock this Thingstaken, pay attention to the Native voices that are speaking up. Bear witness to resistance: be a part of it, observe it, and contribute to it. Those who have been taken from are here to lift up their cultures, their languages, their land, and their people. If we do not hear them, then we are not paying attention; to truly give thanks for our livelihoods here on Turtle Island, we must listen to the Native peoples of this land and we must act for due justice with their guidance."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/250415877t?referring_akid=.2439220.oVKbrC", "Timestamp": "20180918232148", "Sentences": "Credo Action Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument.

It's incited a slew of lawsuits . It makes cooking even the simplest of dinners difficult. But Congress still has a chance to quench the everlasting thirst of this town before the year ends. Flint Mayor Karen Weaver and a group of the city's residents are asking Congress to put them at the top of their list for emergency aid funding before Congress adjourns in mid-December, The Hill reports. As part of the city's final push, more than 100 groups signed a letter on Monday asking Congress to provide the much-needed funds and finalize their emergency spending plan for the city. This all sounds bleak, but there is hope. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sent out a tweet on Monday, calling attention to the issues Flint is still facing. 431 days is a long time. It's almost 63 weeks.

Rather, we've sought to highlight a few of the unsung heroes who embody the ethos that social change begins with people power. They're the sort of people who come home from a long day of work, put dinner on the table and put the kids to bed, and then begin the difficult job of defending the environment. It's not especially glamorous work: crafting outreach emails, enlisting allies, organizing neighbors. But that's how change is made, and it's everyday people who make it happen.

It happened just nine months after the Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India, released more than 40 tons of methyl isocyanate (MIC), killing 3,800 people and injuring another 200,000. Nixon became a spokesperson for People Concerned About MIC, fighting for pollution controls and safeguards for the largely African American community in Institute. Although at one point she became ill with an autoimmune disorder, Nixon has continued to work tirelessly on air and water contamination issues in a variety of public roles, fighting for environmental justice across West Virginia. An oil well owned by AllenCo had recently been drilled two blocks from her school in South Central Los Angeles, and she wasn't the only kid suffering. She responded by going door to door, holding meetings, and rallying her neighbors to join People Not Pozos (People Not Oil Wells). The organization worked with the EPA to get the operation shut down in 2013. In fact, it's a butterfly species (Callophrys viridis) that is increasingly rare in the area. In 2006, some were found barely hanging on in a chain of parks and open spaces. Enter Amber Hasselbring and her Nature in the City project, which worked with local residents, schoolchildren, and others to transform city streets into connective corridors. Then the BP oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico happened. She was a founding contributor to BridgetheGulfProject.org, which shares stories of people affected by social and environmental justice issues, including the spill. She walked from Louisiana to Washington, D.C., where she delivered to EPA administrator Lisa Jackson letters from those who had suffered from the disaster. Before it, she worked at 350.org, first as a youth and student coordinator for the 2014 People's Climate March and later organizing campus fossil fuel divestment activists in the Southwest and primary voters in New Hampshire. Already, its members have pressed Senator Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) for stronger action against Trump and staged a candlelight vigil at the White House. By 1992, she'd decided she wanted to become an Outings leader herself. Since then, Goodwater has led more than 135 trips. She's taken groups through the Rockies, the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and Alaska. She's also traversed England's Coast to Coast Walk, climbed Mt. Goodwater even switched from a full-time job as an electrical engineer to consulting so she could devote more time to leading trips. Now that she's retired, she makes up to 12 excursions a year.

Among them was Shailene Woodley, star of the sci-fi series Divergent and the film Snowden. Like any good millennial, Woodley makes use of Instagram; she rallies her followers to launch local divestment movements against pipeline-supporting banks. She lived near the largest coal plant in Minnesota and worried about its health and environmental effects on her rural community. So she became a Beyond Coal volunteer leader and spent the next four years organizing meetings, writing letters, and spearheading petitions. At times, Thelen was the only one in her community willing to publicly oppose the plant, a major job provider. Last October, the state utility agreed to retire two coal-burning units and committed to doubling its output of renewable energy. In her day job, Thelen travels the world to help develop protections for victims of domestic abuse. By summer, thousands of self-described water protectors had gathered at the Sacred Stone Camp. We had Mongolians. We had Aborigines from Australia. The water protectors' courage in the face of police violence, including the use of water cannons and attack dogs, galvanized supporters.

This treaty proposed that the Wampanoag would protect the English from any enemies, and that the English would do the same for the Wampanoag. But as all first nation tribes know, treaties meant nothing to the colonizers. The sickness they brought wiped out most of the Wampanoag Nation, but this was not the end. The pre-contact population of Native Americans across North and South America was as high as 112 million in 1492, according to the Center for the Study of Diversity in Science, Technology, and Medicine. Today, there are only around three million Native Americans in what is now the U.S., 30 percent of which are below the age of 18, according to the National Congress of American Indians. The U.S. Census found that only seven percent of the native population is over the age of 65. My family does not have enough money to have a feast for Thanksgiving, and neither do most families on reservations. If this seems radical or overdramatic, look back at everything I just told you. You might see why we feel this way. Courtesy of Andreanne Catt Last year, I spent my Thanksgiving with the International Indigenous Youth Council in Oceti Sakowin camp in Standing Rock, South Dakota. Today, we are still opposing big oil companies and the building of pipelines. On Thursday, Nov. 16, 2017, the Keystone Pipeline reportedly leaked 210,000 gallons of crude oil in Marshall County, South Dakota, the cause of which is under investigation. On Nov. 20, the Nebraska Public Service Commission approved the last stage of the pipeline's construction, clearing the way for KXL to pump more than 800,000 barrels of tar sands crude oil a day from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska, then all the way to Nederland, Texas, in other connecting pipelines. We know the hurt that our ancestors had to go through just for us to be here today. Our people are still in pain: Over 90 percent of Native American women have experienced violence at the hands of a non-tribal member, according to the National Institute of Justice. That is 10 times higher than the national average. In my work with Seeding Sovereignty, a women-led non-profit organization that works to decolonize popular narratives like Thanksgiving, I teach self-care and coping mechanisms to other youth who have been affected by the violence of colonialism. We seek to amplify the voice of indigenous cultures and youth at a time when our communities and planet needs to move beyond the roles instilled by the patriarchy. We will keep fighting the same way our ancestors did to protect the land and to decolonize the story of Thanksgiving. So this year, when you're sitting around the table with your family, remember what this day actually observes. It may not matter much to you, but it matters very much to us.

What the article calls for and what needed to happen in the days following the March was not achieved. We are continuing to call the attention of our readers to the analysis in the article. It remains timely and relevant. On its first weekend in power, the Trump-Pence regime moved quickly to establish a fully fascist state. The fate of billions now directly hangs on whether Trump-Pence will be able to fully consolidate this fascist state... or whether this massive opposition can be marshaled into a force to prevent its consolidation and move to oust it from power altogether. Two futures contend. There is still time to stop this, but we must act soon. In every encounter, according to Trump, the U.S. will assert its interests and mess over whoever must be messed over to gain them. People should check out the American Crime series to get just a hint of the literally millions the CIA has had killed and tortured over the past 70 years, all over the planet, in the service of U.S. imperialism. Trump unleashed a war against the press. Trump whipped up the CIA against the press in his speech to the agency, a blatant threat to the right to free expression. It is not for nothing that Trump has expressed a certain kinship to Rodrigo Duterte, the ruler of the Philippines who has unleashed a reign of terror in the ghettos there, carrying out thousands of extra-judicial street killings in less than a year. Indeed, the Trump-Pence regime is an anthill of Christian fascist fanatics, beginning with Pence himself, but also including Ben Carson, Betsy DeVos, and Steve Bannon. Trump directly blamed those who have ruled the U.S. for the past quarter century for the problems of the masses, claiming that they enriched themselves while plundering the people. And it is certainly true that sitting on the stage of the inauguration were big-time criminals and criminal accomplices who have indeed ordered and carried out terrible things. These marches swept up many, many people who do not normally demonstrate and are far from politically radical, but who cleared the day and in some cases came hundreds and even thousands of miles to make their statement. This in turn represents a broader layer of humanity and, potentially, billions. In short, this was something to take real heart from, and to welcome. Haunting this march was a precedent: the weekend shortly before the launching of the war against Iraq by George W. Bush, in which perhaps eight million people around the world came out to voice their opposition. This, too, was a great thing; but Bush held in his hands the power of state, and he ignored the marchers and launched what has turned out to be an utter and truly horrific disaster not only for the people of Iraq, but for people all over the Middle East and, indeed, the world. The toll in deaths and trauma of that war is terrible to contemplate, it continues today, and it will continue for some time. (BAsics 3:12) Now, to be clear, there is in fact a path of hope, a way forward. But to find that way, we have break out of the channels and, indeed, constraints that set the terms for our thinking. The logic of fascism is to stay on the attack, to move quickly and to threaten and bludgeon anything or anyone who gets in their way. The method of fascism is shock and intimidation, one outrage after another, until people are reduced to crouching and cringing in the face of repeated and unpredictable blows. We now face a situation in which Trump and Pence hold in their hands the power of state and in which they have begun to work that logic. But as yet, this power is not consolidated. There is not much time... but there is yet a window that still exists. If on Monday and Tuesday of this week, people answered the call of refusefascism.org in sufficient numbers to begin to stop business as usual, and to call forward others to do that... If this reached into every corner of civil society and the culture at large... If those who knew and had access to the facts were inspired to find the ways to get out any of the real stories behind Trump-Pence and their means and methods and motives and histories, and this created even greater unease, scandal, and crisis... If the sheer numbers began to demoralize and even peel away or win over some Trump supporters (even as it would inevitably energize others), and the momentum began to shift further so as to make not just the lack of support but the fierce and growing opposition to this fascist regime clearer, and there were breaks in the opposition camp... This is not to say that this path would not be difficult, nor to minimize the dangers. It IS to say that the path of waiting to see would be worse. The momentum from this weekend has created a rare opening; it will not last forever. Let history not judge that we squandered it. They stayed in the Square in the tens and hundreds of thousands until on February 11 of that year, Mubarak was driven from office. (Photos: AP) In South Korea, for almost three months now, people have gone into the streets, week after week, demanding the immediate removal of President Park Geun-hye. In a country of 50 million people, there have been 2 million at some of the protests. Park and her family are hated: Her father, Park Chung-hee, brutally ruled South Korea from 1961 to 1979 after seizing power in a military coup. Park Geun-hye is accused of corruption, the government has been forced to impeach her, and a court is now deciding whether to uphold this decision. Protests are continuing, with the people demanding the immediate ouster, arrest, and imprisonment of the president. The entire thrust of the first part of his speech was to actually posit a new legitimacy of Trump voters. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. We have to get rid of ISIS. We have no choice. We have not used the real abilities that we have. And then he talked about the Iraq war in order to put forward his agenda for why the U.S. should utilize its military might ever more aggressively and more viciously in the world. In this way Trump made it clear that he intends to use the full extent of U.S. military might, including nuclear arms, to wipe anyone considered an enemy of the U.S. off the face of the earth. We were unbelievably successful in the election with getting the vote of the military and probably almost everybody in this room voted for me, but I will not ask you to raise your hands if you did. But I would guarantee a big portion. A major part of his speech to the CIA was to continue his attack on the press. Trump filled his speech to the CIA with . lies about the turnout for his inauguration. You saw that. Packed... It looked like a million and a half people. Whatever it was... and I get this network and it showed an empty field. And it said we drew 250,000 people. And we caught them in a beauty. So on day one of his presidency Trump has made it clear he is going to intimidate and suppress anything in the media that gets in the way of his fascist agenda. The rain should have scared them away. Trump is claiming that he has the blessing of god, and he will use this claim to justify all sorts of horrific actions.

The DET authorial team provides insightful, thought-provoking content on a wide range of theological, religious, and even political subjects from current events and culture as well as from the Christian and other religious traditions. In response to protests from indigenous peoples and their fellow supporters to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, private security and local police forces have viciously defended their (prized) construct. The pipeline in question is, on the surface, just another pipeline. It is one of hundreds elsewhere in this country, existing to serve an ostensibly simple purpose: the transportation of crude material for the fossil-fuel industry. It is, arguably, nothing special. Yet, this binary is the product of the capitalist framework in which these crises erupt. By relegating the protests to questions of mere public policy outside the bounds of ideology (e.g. We must deconstruct and escape this framework to ascertain the metaphysical violence at work. Far from being just another pipeline, it is representative of the capitalist abuse of land and people for the sake of profit. For the protesters, the pipeline is the instrument of death and encroachment upon a way of life. The pipeline is ontological and metaphysical violence. Let us be clear on this fact from the onset: Individualism has no place within the Christian tradition. Thus, ideologies which thrive upon exploitation of the communal good for the sake of the powerful one (or the fortunate few) are to be rejected. (Ezekiel 34:17-19) The sin at work is the disregard of others for the sake of individual benefit. The pipeline is a physical manifestation of this vice, the vice of greed, made immanent and tangible. Simultaneously, by its own ontology, it ignores the plight of the people who depend on the land for sustenance, and disregards the land itself which survives by the work of the people it sustains; the two are inextricably linked. The Lord of hosts has sworn in my hearing; Surely many houses shall be desolate, large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant. For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield a mere ephah. But more importantly, it illustrates in very graphic terms the consequences of ideology hell-bent on the accumulation and control of material wealth. The resistance on the part of the state and private security firms to the peaceful protests are indicative of this metaphysical objectification of the pipeline. The response from both sides is visceral simply because the ontological violence at work is egregiously potent. The Christian response, borne out of a tradition which upholds the communal good as God-honoring, must be one of solidarity and peaceful resistance alongside our brothers and sisters who depend upon and revere the land for its life-giving potential. note: Richard M.

Editors used to occasionally enter their offices and glance at the floor to find that some authorial hopeful had pushed a manuscript over the transom. Well, the electronic version of such a thing happened to me with the below post. It was submitted anonymously for reasons that will become obvious when you read it. What we have here is an account of coming to a personal theological reckoning with dialectical theology. I have decided to publish it in accordance with the author's wishes in the hopes that it will encourage others of you who may be in similar situations. He has seen the devil not so much in encountering little girls levitating above their beds, quoting Latin in screechy, ethereal voices, but rather in the fallen principalities and powers of racism, sexism, militarism, and homophobia -- those social, political, economic, and psychological forces that incarnate the power of death and with whom each of us is complicit. More importantly, though, the Arkansas native, raised in the 1950s as an avid segregationist, met not only personal and structural evil, he also was enveloped and transformed by the redeeming and liberating Gospel of Jesus Christ, and from this conversion emerged a prophetic ministry of reconciliation and healing. That same anonymous author has once again been in touch to submit a second missive, which you will find below. It is a powerful re-conception of pastoral work after the death of God.

We're water protectors. Credit: Photo by Allison Herrera More than 140 people were arrested on the Standing Rock Sioux reservation near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, last week. Those clashing with the police decided to occupy a strip of land they claim the tribe owns, according to the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. They insist that they are protecting not only Native people living near the Missouri River from potential contamination from the pipeline, but non-Natives living in nearby towns. The term water protector started before the latest standoff. It makes Native people seem angry and violent for protecting their resources. For a lot of people involved in the demonstrations, the fight begins with prayer. Sterlin Harjo, a filmmaker from Oklahoma, has been out to the Sacred Stone camp and is making a documentary about several people there. 'Cause that system is broken. That system is why we have this problem in the first place. Instead of hitting the streets, people have camped, prayed and sang songs. America is not ready for that. We aren't playing their game. The protests have extended beyond Standing Rock as well. The 1973 standoff between the FBI and the American Indian Movement (AIM) at Wounded Knee was the last event to receive this much attention in Indian Country. Those activists who occupied the small town on the Pine Ridge Indian reservation in South Dakota also wanted the right to name their own struggle. They wanted to call attention to the abuse of power and corruption their tribe was accused of. Plenty of non-Native people have also joined. Many in the Native community are hopeful it will propel politicians and mainstream media to finally pay attention to their issues.

Yet in evolutionary terms this is a blindingly swift change of habitat, and to understand what it means for our future we must turn to the long view of archaeology. Problems of access to resources, disease transmission and pollution follow rapidly on the heels of our great urban experiment. And it is precisely these problems, originating many thousand of years ago, that we must come to terms with if we are going to survive as a species. Skull 1. Violence Facebook Twitter Pinterest A skull dating back 10,000 years showing evidence of a crushing blow to the forehead. Photograph: Marta Mirazon Lahr There is unrelenting archaeological evidence that people can be, well, terrible. These were victims of a world without cities. In the skull pictured here, we can see clearly how lethal violence leaves a testimony in bone: a fatal, crushing blow to the forehead. The skull of this woman from 10,000 years ago, 5,000 years before the first cities came about, is fractured and dented not by time but by malevolence. Her entire community was wiped out in a violent massacre at Nataruk, near the shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya. Indeed, a recent paper in the science journal Nature has suggested that in the Americas and Europe, the first effects of cities was to decrease the level of lethal violence. This might be explained through the social regulation of violence, as societies had to adapt to closer quarters. Cities may have codified the ways we kill, forcing cooperation, suppressing some of our most violent instincts in order to maintain the hierarchical structures that allow so many humans to live together. Skull 2. Disease Facebook Twitter Pinterest The skull of a prostitute with syphilis. The infected soft tissue of the nose and mouth have eaten away at the underlying bone, and the cranium is riddled with infection response to the point that it resembles nothing so much as chewed-up gum, hardened over what remains of the skull. This is the face of third-stage syphilis infection; the bacteria will have caused huge lesions and sores all over the body and eventually worked itself into the bone. Syphilis is a resolutely urban disease. The reason that over half of the 18th-century medical advertisements stored in the Wellcome Library are for syphilis cures is due not to the promiscuity of people, but of cities. These first global cities, like their modern counterparts, ran on trade, on exchange, on the movement of people and accumulation of goods. The sudden appearance of syphilis followed the rapacious exploration of new corners of the globe to seek out new sources of wealth, with the urban states of the medieval period vying for resources. Syphilis arrived in Europe in the pockets of acquisitive explorers and spread rapidly alongside the vital flow of trade on roads laid between urban centres and in armies contesting them, to the urban hearts of the late medieval world. Skull 3. Work Facebook Twitter Pinterest A skull with phosphorus poisoning in the jaw, the result of 19th-century employment in a match factory. Photograph: Wellcome Library, London While we might complain today about the cricks in our neck from hunching over screens, the cities of the Industrial Revolution were potentially fatal places to make a living. Hub of production and enterprise, the industrial city has a history of being unkind to its workers; particularly so when the economy is tilted to continually draw in expendable labour. The workers of early modern London faced deadly conditions to keep the wheels of commerce and industry turning. One of the most shocking examples comes from the phosphorous match factories. Phosphorous is poisonous, but it burns brightly and well, and in the 19th century matches were made by dipping the heads in white phosphorous. A match worker would be exposed to the noxious fumes as they dipped the matchsticks, and the phosphorous would slowly be absorbed into the soft tissue of their mouths. From there, the poison would spread, necrotising the bone and eventually causing the destruction of the jaw, as can be seen in the image here. The work was clearly dangerous, but the inequality of the economy ensured there would always be new matchworkers. The factory owners retaliated by sacking them, and the resulting furore led to a remarkable strike by the women that made waves all the way up to the halls of Westminster. By 1910, parliament had banned the use of white phosphorus. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The preserved skull of urban reformer Jeremy Bentham, held at UCL. Photograph: UCL Special Collections The story of humans in cities is one of adaptation. In inventing urban life, we have essentially given ourselves the tools we need to meet our own challenges. Hidden in each of these skulls is a note of optimism. While violence still haunts us, the fatal pattern of raids and massacres that seem to have been prevalent in the past now occurs mostly where urban states have failed. The diseases that decimated us in the past are now treated with the skills and knowledge born of the specialists and institutions that cities support. And it is among the citizens of our urban centres that we find the movements at the forefront of making the city a safer, cleaner, more equal place. The only grave is Essex: how the county became London's dumping ground Read more A final skull illustrates exactly this best hope for our urban future. London, the busiest metropolis in the western world, had produced people with a zeal for reform; the legacy of these reforms can be seen in the institutions that harness the city for innovation, for radical thinking and for addressing the very problems our cities throw up.

I linked arms with Loretta Bad Heart Bull, and we teetered up to the central prayer circle with Art Zimiga, an Oglala Hunkpapa Vietnam veteran who had just been gifted a pair of crampons. The sun was still warm, the air scented with burning cedar. The sudden announcement that an easement to cross the Missouri River had been denied by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, dealing the pipeline an apparent setback, sent roars of joy, waves of song, disbelief, joy again, all through the camp. Some wept, sank to their knees, waved wands of smoking sage. Loretta grabbed my arm and tugged me closer to the circle, into the crowd. She is a no-nonsense, funny, sharply dressed woman. Everybody let her through. I crushed up next to Vermae Taylor, from Fort Peck, Mont., who had been back and forth to the camp since August. Mary Lyons, an Ojibwe elder from Leech Lake, beamed and held my arm. She was there for her great-grandchildren. This was supposed to be it, the end of months of desperation.

Native Americans have always maintained an outsize presence in the military, serving on a per-capita basis in higher numbers than any other ethnic group. American Indians fought in the Civil War and World War I before we even had citizenship. Many Native Americans volunteered to serve in World War II and Korea before they were included in the Voting Rights Act, and in Vietnam before the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978. In a country founded on religious freedom, Native Americans were not granted the right to legally practice our own religions until 1978. Since then, indigenous spirituality has become a powerful uniting force. Each tribal nation has its own rituals and observances, but we hold in common the conviction that our earth is a living mystery upon whose tolerance we depend. In the Missouri Breaks, you feel that presence acutely. But the flat aqua expanse of Lake Oahe in view of the Oceti Sakowin camp is another story. Up north, the project displaced the Hidatsa, Mandan and Arikara people. Down here, the Lakota. After so many other acts of dispossession, it was said that many elders died of broken hearts. The Black Snake is what Lakota people call the Dakota Access Pipeline. It will extinguish the world. On Monday, I said goodbye to Loretta, who packed me an egg sandwich. I drove home chased by snow. Along I-94 there were the familiar signs, simple black-and-white admonitions, Be Nice, and Be Polite. It could have been the camp motto. So many young non-Native people have been drawn to this cause. I thought about the spindly girl with wild ringlets, smiling as she served me a plate of wontons and strawberries in the food tent. I worried. After a blizzard, there is usually deep cold.

Both Bill and Hillary have blamed the loss on the FBI. While this is becoming a popular trope among the Democratic establishment, it's a terrible excuse for Hillary's loss. First off, the FBI investigation into the Clinton email mess was admittedly a bit of a public fiasco, but Hillary has openly admitted that she mismanaged the safety and security of her emails. She has to own her primary role in that debacle. Secondly, this is Obama's FBI. While this gets closer to owning the problem, even it does not honestly diagnose the real failures of the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party. Hillary Clinton was a terrible candidate to run against Donald Trump. Of course the Obama and Clinton families will never say this, but she was. I honestly believe that she may have been the only leading Democrat that Donald Trump could've beaten. Next to him, she was among the least popular politicians to ever run for president. Her weaknesses and challenges counterbalanced those of Trump time after time after time. Trump is a rich, unethical liar with major character problems. To beat him, you run the opposite of that. Clinton, true or not, was not seen as the opposite, but the Democratic equivalent. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, or even Joe Biden or Cory Booker would've all matched up better against Trump and his weaknesses, but you couldn't tell the Democratic Party that. They had it all figured out from the very beginning. Republican candidate Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election in the early hours of the morning in a widely unforeseen upset. The former Democratic Presidential nominee conceded defeat to president-elect Donald Trump earlier in the morning. Donald Trump defeated Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to become the 45th president of the United States. Donald Trump walks onto the stage as the 45th U.S. President after defeating Hillary Clinton in an improbable victory on Nov. 9, 2016. 2016. Republican nominee Donald Trump claimed an early lead in the race to become the president of the United States. Whereas Trump tapped into the anger and frustration of his voter base, the Democratic Party failed to do the same thing on issues that had widespread grassroots support from coast to coast. The Black Lives Matter Movement never really believed Clinton cared. She all but ignored the Dakota Access Pipeline - in spite of the fact that millions of people were outraged about it. Documents revealed that she supported fracking. Terry McAuliffe, who by all accounts is among the closest confidantes of the Clinton family, openly said she would flip on TPP once elected. Instead of being anti-war, she was seen as a hawk. That's what cost her the election. Each of those issues are fueled by an energized base of supporters who knew full well that they did not have a true friend and ally in her or the Democratic Party establishment. It's why she struggled to fill arenas as Bernie regularly spoke to thousands of supporters. Both Bill and Hillary have blamed the loss on he FBI. He's not even that charismatic, but doggone it, people believed him when he speak out on the issues that mattered most. White supremacy made a difference. The FBI debacle made a difference. Russian interference made a difference Hillary Clinton was a terrible candidate to run against Donald Trump. The Democratic Party put out the wrong candidate, but even with her, they could and should've still won this election, but they repeatedly ignored and dismissed progressive people and causes that could've tipped it in her favor. As nice as Tim Kaine is, they chose a Vice President who was safe, but did nothing to move the needle even marginally. I've never seen anything like it. Hundreds of thousands of people have come forward to say they want Keith to lead the party, but the party stalls and stalls and stalls, and seems determined to do anything other than pick the progressive choice. If the Democratic Party is going to have any success moving forward, it must lean into progressive populism and not away from it.

The Army Corps has said it will consider an alternative route, and President-elect Donald Trump favors completion of the pipeline project. But for now, the pipeline is stopped, giving protesters time to continue their organizing efforts. Leia Petty We started where everyone does--at the 9 a.m. orientation for newcomers in the Big Dome, a white dome structure erected by water protectors for larger ceremonial gatherings. It's also where the Saturday night Circle Dance took place, where camp councils focused on various topics--such as direct action, winterization and women's meetings--met and where Dr. Cornel West was scheduled to speak. The orientation for newcomers began with prayer, like so much else at the camp--before and after meetings, daily walks to the river, and throughout speeches at the Sacred Fire. There is tremendous pride among the Indigenous leadership of the camp in sharing customs, prayers and dance with those arriving from across the country. We were welcomed into a way of life that has been systematically stripped away for hundreds of years and kept alive in small pockets throughout the country. Standing Rock has provided a place where these customs are taking on a new life. There were close to 300 newcomers at the orientation. Solidarity runs deep at Standing Rock, and it has quickly blossomed into self-sustaining and self-governing town, making Standing Rock the 10th-largest city in North Dakota, possibly larger once all of the 2,000 military veterans en route to protect the camp finish arriving. Water protectors celebrate after hearing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' decision (ajplus) The solidarity comes in many different forms. Some 700 Indigenous nations have representatives here, and their flags line Flag Road, which serves as the main street of Oceti Sakowin, the main resistance camp. It's the first time so many Natives have come together since the 19th century. The question-and-answer session turned into an open mic session, in which people told where they came from and why they were here--from Indigenous nations, to delegations of chaplains, to individuals who found their way here on their own because they couldn't stay away. Muhammad, an Iraqi-American, flew from Phoenix after a call went out over Twitter that the school they are building needed firewood. He flew in late Friday and made multiple trips back and forth from Bismarck, North Dakota, to help transport building supplies for the school. Cornelia, a blind woman in her late 50s from New Hampshire, traveled three days in a truck carrying 238 straw bales after she heard they were needed as windbreakers. After delivering the hay bales they purchased, she helped wash dishes in one of the kitchens and said she loved the feel of the ice under her feet. Her friend Tim from Massachusetts worried she might fall as she played on the ice. She assured him she has a great sense of balance. From the moment we arrived, it was clear that there was no way the Army Corps of Engineers would be able to carry out their eviction notice. In every direction, the camp was expanding, the numbers were swelling, and supply trucks were arriving with donations. On my last morning there, I unfortunately got sick. Yet despite the difficult circumstances was given immediate and incredibly compassionate care--from the people who helped me to the medic tent, to the nurses who cared for me, and the herbalist who made a specific tea for my diagnosed ailment. There was an openness all around, greetings when you walk past your new neighbors on the roads, conversations while waiting for the bathroom, new friends made while eating at communal tables. Hundreds of people packed into the White Dome at 8 p.m., and hundreds more cycled through late into the night, many retuning to the main kitchen afterward for a late dinner. The singers and drummers stood facing each other in the very center of the dome with hundreds of people from all walks of life surrounding them, two-stepping a circle around them. There was a self-organized security system, garbage collecting, donation sorting, fire keepers, construction, volunteer coordinating, winterization and direct action. Some sounded like greetings, others sounded like battle cries. There was also the more spontaneous self-organization of someone seeing a need and stepping in to address it. I met Joey in the main kitchen where I was working. He had planned to come for a few days and had ended up staying for weeks. He had just finished building the Animal House, a rescue place for dogs without an owner. The first dog there had become separated from his owner, who was a medic with hypothermia and was being treated at a nearby hospital. He was now in good hands. While I was in the medic tent, there was strategizing about how to handle the increased numbers of people coming in with injuries from falling on the ice. They were looking into metal attachments for elders, the main people at risk of serious injury from falling, to place on shoes. Someone then arrived to donate two snowmobiles they could use to transport medics and patients. Respect and care for elders stands in such stark contrast to how the elderly are treated in the world outside the camp. Elder water protectors are being provided with better medical services inside Oceti Sakowin than is often available in their local community or through the criminally underfunded Indian Health Service. Seats are given up to elders, and their food is served first. At the main kitchen, lunch was running late and dozens of people waited while we went on food deliveries around the center of camp to ensure elders and fire keepers were fed. The camp expanded massively throughout the weekend, with a line of cars as far as the eye could see as they waited to enter the camp all day Saturday and Sunday. There is no question that the arrival of military veterans, numbering in the thousands, was decisive in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deciding to deny the permit. They had hoped that their eviction notice, threats of fines and harassment of those bringing in supplies would deter solidarity. It was deepened instead. My days at Oceti Sakowin gave a glimpse, more so than anything else I've experienced, of the power of self-organization--that if it were up to us, we would have an entirely different way of running things and relating to each other. Edna Bonhomme The Indigenous struggle for self-determination has been going on for more than 500 years, and yesterday's victory is a reflection of the incredible efforts of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people who have gathered to fight for clean water and land. As one Lakota person said at the orientation, this was the first time in 140 years that neighboring tribes reached consensus on an issue. The Dakota Access Pipeline posed a threat--to incur further environmental damage, disturb sacred ground and undermine Indigenous sovereignty--and so this unified resistance brought the greed and profit of Energy Transfer Partners to heel. On December 3, at the daily direct action meeting, which happens at 2 p.m., organizers described how the actions--whether they were marches or prayers--would be nonviolent. This dovetailed with the broader message of having no weapons, alcohol or drugs on site. This was a place where people would gather and resist with a clear mind and spirit. After the direct action meeting, I spoke with Lisia Williams, a 36-year-old African American member of Service Employees International Union from Flint, Michigan, who came to Standing Rock in solidarity because of Flint's own fight for clean water. History is being repeated. When I asked a resident of Bemidji, Minnesota, why he came to Standing Rock, he said that his town was struggling with a company that had several pipelines going through their county. In a town whose population is 25 percent Native American and which has high unemployment, he immediately saw the parallel with Standing Rock. On the night of December 3, I worked in the kitchen from 9:30 p.m. until 11:20 p.m. As someone who has worked in the restaurant industry before, this was the first time that I was in a multigenerational and multiethnic kitchen where people were laughing and smiling. People were genuinely happy to be there. On December 4, early-morning prayer began at 6 a.m. By 7:30 a.m., as dawn was setting in, a history lesson began, in which a Lakota historian and teacher made parallels between surveillance under the Israeli occupation of Palestinians and the surveillance of Natives under the Bureau of Indian Affairs. He continued by dismantling the stereotypes that Native peoples do not pay taxes--in fact, they have paid taxes through the Homestead Act and the Dawes Act. An Indigenous woman from the Pacific Northwest spoke about her tribe and its struggle to exist. That same day, Cornel West spoke to an interfaith gathering of about 400 people about the need for solidarity and struggle. The beauty of the weekend was seeing everyday people run this whole community that has sprung up in recent months. People were there because of something greater than themselves, and they were infused with an unmistakable positive energy. In the end, they won because solidarity was strong and spirits were high. Emily Brooks We entered the Oceti Sakowin encampment at night, so we couldn't see the bustling landscape of tents, teepees and people until the morning. We were welcomed by a friendly camp security person who gave us directions to the location where we planned to stay. Our tent, which housed a wood-burning stove, had been built by New York City teachers who came before us to Standing Rock. When we woke up, we threw on the layers and layers of warm clothing that had been donated by friends and supporters in New York and headed out into the cold. In the light of morning, we could see the fully functioning community of Oceti Sakowin. The Sacred Fire situated off Flag Road serves as a space of prayer and communal gathering. The fire is kept burning at all times, and people make offerings of tobacco and sage. Tents around the fire provide coffee and hot water, post daily schedules and host music and messages of solidarity. We went to the media area known as Facebook Hill to get press passes, but because of the massive influx of people, the tent had run out. Kids were laughing and sledding down Facebook Hill. We went to one of the camp's nine kitchens to help out, but they were overwhelmed with volunteers. So we chatted with folks as we waited for a lunch of alpaca soup, bean soup and apple fritters. Morgan, a student who had driven to the camp from Bar Harbor, Maine, was helping to prepare the meals. She was part of an environmental group on her campus, and they had attended some policy conferences to promote change, but decided that this wasn't getting anywhere. When they heard about the struggle at Standing Rock, they were inspired, and it clicked: Activism and organizing is more effective. We helped carry plates of food to elders sitting by the fire. Even this small gesture was received with kind and generous expressions of gratitude. We walked up Flag Road and toward the bridge where the pipeline construction forces were marshaled and where water protectors have been violently attacked by law enforcement. We approached and stood in front of a string extended across the path about 100 yards from the bridge and chatted with the camp security working there. He told us that this line had been drawn by camp elders. From where we stood, we could see the barricades of trucks on the bridge and more vehicles lined up on the road on the opposite riverbank. Harsh spotlights lit the bridge from the opposite side, and a helicopter circled overhead. Seeing these forces assembled on the bridge presented a stark contrast to the camp and provided an ever-present reminder of why we were there. He asked us to take them and give them to people who looked cold. Next we came across three people butchering a large leg of beef, which later was served in United Heart kitchen as meat hash. It was delicious. All around the camp, we saw people building new structures and winterizing existing ones. There was a centralized construction tent, which found ways to put people to work even if they lacked construction skills. Many people around camp were preparing to be there for the long term--or as long as it took to win. We helped serve food in United Heart kitchen. More than 30 people were working to prepare a meal of turkey gravy, fry bread, squash soup, tamales, coleslaw and beans. As word spread through the camp, hundreds of people began flocking towards the Sacred Fire eager to hear if the rumor of a victory was true. Drums and jubilant shouts erupted in the crisp air. People embraced one another. Some wept as the realization sunk in that we had won an important victory in a long road of struggle. Still, police helicopters continued to hover overhead, and Morton County sheriffs and construction officials occupied the hilltops across the river. A second Indigenous leader stood up to address the crowd to point out that although this is a great victory, the fight is far from over. They'll pay the fine. Though the crowd felt empowered by what they had accomplished collectively, questions were posed about what this meant for the camp, the veterans and the coming months ahead. We're not done yet. And beyond this, the question of the looming Trump presidency was also on many people's minds. But at the same time, everyone understood that today's victory would never have happened if the thousands assembled there hadn't risen to the occasion and stood united when they were told to disband. One woman, an Iraq war vet, approached us as the celebrations were ongoing. Meanwhile, the camp kept growing. Cars and buses full of veterans lined up as far as the eye could see to enter Oceti Sakowin. With newfound confidence, water protectors are settling in for a long fight. Mni wiconi.

Some people opt to have a car tracker permanently installed to the vehicle through the 12-volt system, while others will simply put batteries in the tracker and place the device in a covert spot in the automobile. The people who choose not to go with the hard-wire option will often find themselves thinking about where the best place to hide the car tracker would be without the person being tracked finding the unit. Although under the front seat, passenger seat or glove box tend to be some of the more popular choices of placement, one location many people may not be aware is a solid location is underneath the vehicle. Many people are shocked when they first hear that a vehicle tracking device could function properly when placed underneath an automobile. However, it is very important to note that not every GPS monitoring device has the ability to pick up signals when attached to the under belly of a vehicle. It takes superior antenna reception and design to have the ability to pick up GPS signals from underneath a vehicle. That is one of the engineering masterpieces about the GPS Tracking Key and GPS Tracking Key Pro. Not to mention, both of those GPS monitoring devices are designed with magnetic mounts, making it easy for anyone to simply magnetically attach the car tracker to the outside frame of a car. With a strong internal antenna and casing strong enough to handle many elemental conditions, these car tracking systems are able to catch GPS signals that bounce off the ground, storing the position-based data to internal memory. The only way the device is going to be removed from the vehicle is if you or someone else takes it off. All Rights Reserved.

Winds NNW at 5 to 10 mph.. Tonight Mostly clear. Low 66F. Winds NNW at 5 to 10 mph. I felt powerless. For a week or so, I fell prey to these feelings. Then, I drove west with my wife, Mary; my son, Elijah; and a friend and her two boys to South Dakota, to Standing Rock. I wanted to regain a sense of power, to regain a modicum of agency in a world where the reality was exactly the opposite. After nearly three days, we finally found ourselves at the gates of the Oceti Sakowin camp, otherwise known as Standing Rock. I think we were all bruised from the trip that had taken far longer than we expected, and I felt anxious about what I would find at the camp. At the gate was a checkpoint manned by a handful of young men, all Native American. They were brusque but respectful. They asked us who we were and checked out the six occupants of the minivan. No Drugs. From the very beginning of our stay, the seriousness of the camp, its energy, its mission pervaded the atmosphere. At first I only glimpsed this because I simply could not take in what I was seeing. The camp was large and extensive. As we drove to find a campsite for our tent, I saw RVs, teepees, cars of all shapes and sizes, huts, tents inhabiting a space bordered by the road and the river. Flags fluttered in the wind, and signs offering slogans, directions, identifications peppered every surface. People of all shapes, sizes, races wandered about, some with purpose, others seemingly without, taking no notice of our vehicle. As I came to understand, people arrived and left constantly. We were just one group among many groups of supporters. We already knew that this was not a vacation and that we would need to contribute to the camp. What I did not see at the beginning was the nature of this contribution. I could not understand how this thing worked but, putting aside my confusion, I set out to find a place for myself. I found myself in a kitchen but not quite like any kitchen where I had ever worked. Lit by a series of bare bulbs, it was dim and enclosed. The floors were covered with layers of straw and cardboard, slowly decomposing into the South Dakota soil. Everywhere I looked, I saw shelves and tables loaded with miscellaneous bags and boxes of donated food. A young woman was running the kitchen, and I asked her if there was anything I could do. She handed me a knife and told me to cut up a box of apples that they would then roast and use in a soup. This was how I could contribute: a small task that helped feed some people who would then contribute their own efforts. I was beginning to see how Oceti Sakowin worked. The next day, we gathered in another Army surplus tent to listen to the orientation. None of us knew how long we would be there or what form this orientation would take. But there must have been close to 80 people crowded into the tent facing two young women who, in no uncertain terms, laid out the ground rules for us all. We were told that we were part of something bigger than ourselves and that we needed to be humble in the face of this. No pictures, no appropriation or New Age embrace of Native American culture. These I could stand by. Our orientation facilitators stepped aside to introduce a young Native American from New Mexico named Graham. It was through his words that I really began to grasp the true nature of what I had become involved in. The tent began to grow stuffy. Most of us were standing in a semi-circle. I could feel the fatigue in my legs. I could feel the fatigue of us all. And yet, this young man offered us words that somehow energized us. He spoke of a struggle that had been going on for centuries in which Standing Rock and the Dakota Access Pipeline were just one more battle. He spoke of respect for the sacred traditions of all indigenous peoples no matter where on the globe they might live. It was not just his words but his whole demeanor. Idealistic but firmly grounded. Energetic but disciplined. I was to see this same powerful presence the next night. Looking for warm drinks for our company, we had entered a mess tent offering tea, coffee and hot chocolate. As we entered, a pre-meal prayer ceremony began. The focus of the ceremony was another young Native American man, this time from Northern California. He spoke of the history that lay behind Standing Rock. He spoke too of the 400 years of struggle, saying that, whatever the outcome, struggle would go on. Behind his words, I heard a message that our actions were merely a part of a much greater struggle of which we were just a small part and that, in essence, that victory was inevitable. We had only to do our part. And he asked us to see that whatever choices we had made in the past, whatever had happened to us, whatever roads we had traveled to get to Standing Rock, they had led us to this moment, this place, and that this was good. The morning before we left the camp, all of us took part in a direct action. It was to be a peaceful response to the violence that had taken place the previous week. It was an odd sight. In the middle of nowhere, at least 30 cars parked along a two-lane road and perhaps a couple of hundred activists got out. At a junction stood two handfuls of deputies dressed all in black riot gear. We stood in a circle. As the U.S. Border Patrol SUVs pulled up, we all walked peacefully back to our cars and left. No more than 30 minutes had passed, but I thought that we had somehow made a point and that our actions were just another part of a long series of actions that tried to move us all forward. We left that afternoon, and three days later, we were home. It took some days to really process what we had seen and done. I am not sure about how I will now direct my efforts nor do I know what form my actions will take. But I no longer feel powerless. Standing Rock helped me understand that.

David Rollingcloud Last week, author, photographer and Lamb of God vocalist Randy Blythe visited the Standing Rock camp in Cannonball, North Dakota. Below is his account of what he witnessed, who he met and what he learned. The late afternoon sun was sinking towards the rolling hills of Morton County as I drove south on North Dakota Highway 6. My friend David and I had fallen uncharacteristically silent, our normally constant stream of inappropriate jokes and mutual ball-breaking at a standstill. As we stared at the beautiful countryside spread out before us, both lost in our private contemplation of what we were about to do, I turned down the Killing Joke In Dub album pulsing through the rental car stereo and looked to David. Always a twinge of fear. We were definitely heading towards a serious situation. David is friend of mine and tribal member of the Leech Lake band of Ojibwe in Minnesota. He was accompanying me to Cannonball, North Dakota, a small community located in the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation. We were going to Oceti Sakowin, the largest of four camps erected alongside the Cannonball River in protest of the Dakota Access Pipeline being constructed on land that the Sioux consider sacred. The Sioux say that construction of the pipeline will desecrate tribal burial sites, as well being concerned that the pipeline (which would carry half a million gallons of crude oil per day beneath the Missouri River) could burst and contaminate their primary water supply. I had first gotten wind of the resistance to DAPL via social media, as there was (and still is) a shockingly small amount of coverage available via mainstream media outlets. The scattered news that does get reported seems shallow to me in light of such a large and historic gathering of people, and the voices of the indigenous people there are more often than not marginalized. I had been trying to find out what I could about Standing Rock over the last two months while touring with two different bands, and had become increasingly concerned the more I read up on the situation. There were stories of attack dogs and tear gas and rubber bullets, reporters being arrested, rumors of a media blackout and of supplies needed for the oncoming brutal North Dakota winter. After Clinton called Trump to concede victory, I took a break from election coverage to see if there was any news from Standing Rock, and in the process found out that our brand-new President-elect had personally invested money in the pipeline. I carried an old Army duffel stuffed with brand-new zero-degree sleeping bags and heavy wool army blankets from the local surplus store. My suitcase was crammed with more blankets, winter clothes, and 10 pounds of freshly roasted beans donated by Lamplighter, a local coffee shop I frequent. I began contacting Native friends of mine to see what on-the-ground information they had about Standing Rock; when I hit up David he decided to come along to represent his people. I flew to Minnesota on November 21st, we loaded our supplies and some firewood into the rental car, then left that night to try and beat a winter storm blowing in that evening. We made it as far as Fargo before stopping due to ice forming on the roads. The next day we continued on deeper into North Dakota. As we drove, we discussed the importance of keeping our hearts free of anger, no matter what happened or what we saw. The camps at Standing Rock were first organized as Spirit Camps, places of prayer. We wanted to respect the original intent of the people who had set up the camps, even though the number of people there had swelled in size more than they could have ever foreseen. As well, the severity of the tactics used by law enforcement had increased. Clouds of tear gas filled the air, and people were being shot with bean-bag rounds and rubber bullets. A woman had been hit with a concussion grenade, mangling her arm and nearly blowing it off. It angered me to see these things, but everything I had been able to find out about Standing Rock led me to believe that carrying that anger with me into the camps would be disrespectful, so before we left we made sure our motives were pure and our heads were clear and focused on the task ahead. We would go and bring supplies to the people, pay our respects to the elders there, and be a helpful presence in camp in whatever form that would take for the few days we would be there. Now was not the time for punk-rock shenanigans. As we joined the short line of cars entering Oceti Sakowin through the north gate of the camp, we were met by a young Native security guard with a cast on his arm. Yep. We drove down Flag Row, the main road cutting through camp lined with the flags of different Indian nations and headed towards the eastern end of camp, near a horse corral. We pitched our tent with the assistance of young man from Philadelphia named Jason. By the time we had figured out how to get our borrowed tent up, it was almost dark, and we were getting cold and hungry. We had brought food to cook and donate, but decided to see if there were any kitchens open so that we could eat and get some sleep. We walked back up to the security checkpoint and introduced ourselves to Baloo, the young man who had let us in earlier. As he led us down a hill to his camp, David asked Baloo if he had hurt his arm on the bridge. We ate a dinner of grilled burgers and hot soup at the Blackfoot camp, thanked them, then walked back to our tent to bundle up in our sleeping bags and crash. Before sunrise the next morning, I was awakened by a deep voice blasting through a loudspeaker. We rolled out of our sleeping bags, and I borrowed a shovel from the camp next door and dug a fire pit. While David cooked us a backstrap of venison for breakfast, we made our plan for the day. All new campers were requested to attend one of two daily orientation meetings, so we decided to go to the 9 a.m. meeting after we ate. We finished our breakfast and walked to the center of camp where the orientation meeting would take place. Along the way, I heard someone call out my name. A young man named Cory introduced himself and asked if he could take a picture with me. Cory had come to Standing Rock with two of his classmates from Stanford. Both fans of heavy-metal bands like my own and Native Americans have often been stereotyped as violent, drunken, savages. And while there are indeed violent, drunken, savage people of all races and musical tastes, I did not meet any of them at Standing Rock. Furthermore, the fans I met there, both Native and non-Native, were without fail polite and well-spoken. They all expressed their gratitude to me for my presence, treated me with respect, and did not attempt to hog my time. This was my experience. At orientation, we were split up into two groups of around 150 people each and listened to facilitators talk about the purpose of the camps and protocols to abide by while there. The two facilitators were both women, a Filipino New Yorker and a white Californian who got a bit too weepy and self-flagellating for my tastes. Act in a manner respectful of elders and to Native traditions and culture, which may be very different than your own. We are here for a purpose, not a holiday. These things seemed to be almost childishly self-evident to me, but they obviously needed to be said, as I found out later when I saw some young people not getting up to offer elders their seats. About 15 of us raised our hands. Then a Native man from California got up and gave an impassioned speech about the need to remain prayerful and non-violent. He was followed by a local Lakota man who said much the same thing, then a female Canadian First Nations elder began talking about how she was ashamed of how so much oil was coming from her country. She was speaking in such a low voice that I could barely make out what she was saying. David and I decided to leave, as the orientation had veered away from practical matters into emotion, and we wanted to find a way to be of use. We went back to camp to decide where to distribute our supplies, and since the Blackfoot camp had fed us, we brought them one of our five-pound bags of coffee. The headman there thanked us heartily, and invited us back to eat with them anytime we wished. We tightened up our camp some more until it was time for direct-action training. The training was held in the northwest section of the camp, and was attended by around 200 people. The people leading the training began by stressing the fact that the protocols for direct action at Standing Rock were developed in conjunction with the local elders, and that people who had participated in acts of civil disobedience elsewhere should remember that there was a certain way things were to be done that might look different from what they were used to. Then a medic demonstrated how to treat injuries from chemical weapons. After the medic spoke, a facilitator called for volunteers to act as water bearers and banner carriers. We all linked arms and formed a group around them, then began to move. The objective was move the group as a unit in a circle around the camp. After spending the majority of my adult life in a touring band and attending more basement punk-rock shows than I can remember, it felt pretty normal to me. After we had successfully reached our objective point, there was a debriefing session followed by an open discussion of what we thought had gone right with the mock action and what we could have done better. Afterwards, a young Native fan from Gallup, New Mexico, named Sabrina asked if she could take a picture with me and a Mni Wiconi banner, and I agreed. After a dinner of jambalaya at the Blackfoot camp, David and I walked up to Facebook Hill, so named as it was one of the only places in camp where cell reception existed. Even there, it was spotty at best. I checked a few emails, then posted one photo to my Instagram account just to let people know I had arrived at Standing Rock safely. As soon as the post went up, my screen immediately went a blank gray color, and the phone stayed frozen. I did a hard reset, and the screen showed that my battery was completely drained before the phone completely died. I had had at least a 50-percent charge seconds before. We went back to our tent, and before going to bed I plugged my phone into a rechargeable battery I had brought. The phone started right back up, the battery indicator showing half a charge. I got dressed and made us some breakfast. As we sat in the gently falling snow enjoying our last few bites of scrambled eggs, a woman came ripping by our tents in a muddy SUV, yelling into a bullhorn. We removed our camping knives from our belts, grabbed a few bottles of water, and began walking towards the gate. The peaceful mood of the morning was replaced by a palpable tension as people moved quickly up flag row. By the medic tent, David grabbed a few pairs of rubber gloves to protect our hands in case tear gas was deployed. I tied my bandana around my neck and gave David a neck warmer I had on to cover his face. With so much confusion in the air, I decided to go scope the situation at the north gate out, and David said he would join me after checking on the elders. There were Native security guards on the bridge, telling the people not to move forward any further. I stood there, looking across at the rows of concertina wire and all the police on the other side of the two-lane bridge. No one on either side seemed to be moving, so I climbed up the hill beside the bridge to see what I could. I looked to the far northeastern shore of the Cannonball River at the area known as Turtle Island, and saw a large group of people massing, perhaps half a mile away as the crow flies. I walked back down onto the edge of the bridge, and met a Native woman from Flagstaff named Vontrivia, who asked me for a picture. We talked briefly and took a few photos, then David appeared to check on me. We decided to head back into camp, and I walked over to Turtle Island. As I headed toward the throng of people at Turtle Island, I heard singing, drumming, and chanting getting louder and and louder. I walked into the crowd of several hundred people gathered on the muddy river bank and saw two young men getting out of a canoe at the bottom of a steep hill on the opposite shore, perhaps 30 feet away. More people were loading into canoes, and over the next 15 minutes the group across from us grew from two to 50 people. The ridge line at the top of the hill became crowded with heavily armed police officers and men in tactical gear staring down at us. I saw rifles, grenade launchers, safety-orange shotguns, large pepper-spray canisters resembling fire extinguishers and a few water hoses that were rolled out. Hooded men with binoculars and video cameras walked the hilltop, filming and scanning our faces constantly. A burly young Native man walked up next to me and politely introduced himself in an even voice. In the energy of the crowd, Joseph was a calming presence, and I was happy to have him beside me. Suddenly a great cheer went up from the people to our left, and I saw a makeshift bridge constructed of wood, rope and Styrofoam being pushed across the river, several people riding on top. People began crossing over the flimsy looking bridge, which to my surprise stayed afloat. Return across the river. Do not approach us, or we will have no choice but to view it as an act of aggression and will be forced to respond. Except for one person I saw begin to charge up the hill (they were immediately and firmly stopped by two Native men), I did not witness anyone moving towards the police line at all, nor acting in any manner that I would construe as aggressive. Do not bring children. Remain in prayer. Remain peaceful. Do not antagonize the police. The surgical gloves people were putting on were to protect their hands in case of tear gas. The liquids they were mixing were milk of magnesia and water, to flush eyes and mucous membranes, also in case of tear gas. We all could clearly see what people were doing from across the water, even without the benefit of the high-powered binoculars the cops had trained on us. While this ludicrous statement was initially funny to me, I began to see how it could quickly turn serious if the cops actually used these actions as justification to use force. It was eerie looking up at so many armed men, knowing that they could open fire on us at any time. After about 45 minutes the group across the shore had grown to about three hundred people, all singing, dancing, and praying at the base of the hill. I looked at the river and thought It would be cold, but I could definitely swim that no problem if they opened fire. I thought about how my digital cameras would be ruined, and decided that although it would suck, I would get over it. If I went to jail, I would remain there through the weekend, and I had promised that we would have the car back on time and in good shape on Saturday. Joseph and I were almost right beside the bridge by this point, and I was thinking about how fast I would have to swim across the river to avoid arrest and hopefully avoid hospitalization for hypothermia in order to return the car on time when people began crossing back over to our side of the river. The elders had decided that the action was to be terminated before the police got too agitated. I had been standing in the cold mud for over an hour by this point, and my feet were frozen, even through my heavy boots. Joseph and I walked back to my camp, along the way meeting David, who was coming to check on me. We sat by our campfire for a bit, warming our feet and drinking coffee until Joseph invited us to dinner at his camp, where many of the security guards were staying. When a policeman had seen him picking them up and told him he was not allowed to take them as they were considered evidence at a crime scene, he performed a bit of sleight-of-hand, palmed them and walked away. I picked up the rounds and felt them. I also saw video footage of a man standing in front of the water cannons, his arms spread out to the side like Christ, taking the freezing blasts face on. Joseph told me about seeing a small Asian woman getting dropped right in front of him by rubber bullets, then a cop running up and pepper-spraying her while she lay on the ground. When the food was ready, we heard drumming begin inside their large green army tent and a Sioux man began singing a Lakota song. We all went inside, then some guests from another tribe took up the drum and sang in their language. Then the drum was passed to a group of Pawnee visitors, who sang three or four songs in their tongue. Then a plate was made for the matriarch of the tent, a beautiful grandmother in her late seventies. After Grandmother received her food, plates were made for the other elders. Then women and children got their food, followed by the men. As visitors, David and I waited until one of the women told us to hurry up or we would miss out on the ribs and fry bread they had made. The whole process of blessing the food with song and prayer took at least half an hour. In a tent in North Dakota, on a holiday that many Native Americans associate with colonization and the destruction of their way of life, I watched people receive their food with a level of gratitude and respect for those that prepared it that I have never witnessed at any Thanksgiving dinner, and they did this as a matter of course. There was no mention of any holiday or hurried recitations of a few things they were grateful for; they just gave thanks, and they did it with sincerity. It was awesome to be a part of it. After dinner there was more singing and dancing around the fire. A Paiute man from Pyramid Lake, Nevada (whom we determined was a cousin of some friends of mine there) sang beautifully until his voice was hoarse, and almost stopped until Grandmother came outside to dance. Others sang as well, both in Native languages and in English. Some of the songs included references to steamy texting and misleading social-media profile pictures. Native Americans are not magical creatures from some forgotten era; they are human beings living in the modern world just like anyone else. A feeling of closeness and belonging hung in the air. After a while both David and I left for our camp, thanking everyone for the food and company. Our final morning was the coldest one; ice covered the tent and the air outside was a balmy 17 degrees. We made breakfast, then began breaking down camp. Joseph and his girlfriend stopped by on the way to the nearby casino for breakfast, and we put in an order for cold sodas. When they returned, we loaded up their car with most of the items we had brought to donate. They drove the supplies over to their camp, then David and I carried two of the wool blankets and some sacks of tobacco directly to one of the elders he had met the first day we were there. It was the proper way to show respect, to thank a local for letting us visit his land. He was a funny old man. He passed the shell to me, I washed myself with the smoke, and I prayed in my own way too. Maybe if everyone felt protected, then the violence could stop. David and I left Standing Rock and went home to our friends and families. It had been a brief, but very intense trip. Both of us learned a lot during our time there, but I left with far more questions than answers. I went to bring supplies and show support for people that I believed were being treated with unnecessary force while peacefully protesting something they believed endangered their welfare. What is happening at Standing Rock is a reaction to the continued and systematic oppression of the indigenous people of our land. I am amazed at the level of restraint and commitment to nonviolence the overwhelming majority of these people have continued to display in such large numbers, and can only pray that everything remains as peaceful as possible. If the events occurring there were to happen in a major American city instead of way out on the edge of an isolated Indian reservation, there would be massive riots, and there is no question about that in my mind. There are other questions, though; hard questions that we need to start asking ourselves, all of us. I am a touring musician who makes his living traveling around the world in vehicles powered by fossil fuels. These things were made then shipped to distribution centers in vehicles requiring fossil fuels. The clothes I am wearing and the glasses I see through contain fossil fuels. Even the surfboards I ride when I am in the ocean, communing with my favorite part of the natural world, are made from fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are pervasive in my life. They are in yours, too. Fossil fuels are named such because they are derived from decaying plant and animal matter that once lived hundreds of millions of years ago. Fossil fuels are a finite, non-renewable resource. Humanity has the potential to reproduce and increase in size infinitely, at least until the sun burns itself out and our planet dies of natural cosmic causes. The supply is going to run out. Fossil fuels also pollute the ever-loving crap out of our planet. This is not a matter of debate. This year, smog in Los Angeles was at its highest level since 2009, with hospitals and clinics reporting increases in patients seeking treatment for respiratory illness associated with bad air quality. Oil spills poison our waters, wiping out marine life. The events at Standing Rock are a timely reminder that we are killing our planet, and it is the only one we have. We have to begin damage control now, and as one race start embracing clean energy alternatives. This will obviously not occur overnight, and the millions of hard-working people who feed their families by working in the fossil-fuel industry will need to be provided with a way to earn a living.

As I was thumbing through the paper I saw a job announcement for a staff writer position at Native Sun News under Tim Giago and what happened was I brought in a writing sample and Mr. Giago knew who my family was, knew my connections to the reservation, just kind of knew my history, and seeing that I had some writing skills, just gave me an opportunity. My work picked up a lot of followers locally. And for me, my good times to work are from 4 a.m. to 10 a.m. Working with people you know and covering news about people you know comes with the blessings but it also comes with the hardships of having to expose certain things about people you may know personally or be on the other end of a political idea or a political view or policy.

Ecoffey spoke honestly and passionately about covering Native American issues in modern media. He showed the incredible juxtaposition of minimizing harm and seeking truth. Ecoffey obviously finds that rewarding. What mattered the most to me from the entire interview was that he said journalists need to come from a position of compassion and respect.

Dundon, 31, a Navajo and mother of four, had arrived two months earlier to join thousands of others in their battle against the Dakota Access pipeline. Now pipeline foes wanted to clear them and open the road for emergency vehicles. The men moved onto the bridge. Police in riot gear fired tear gas canisters and rubber bullets from behind barbed wire. As Dundon took cover, she heard a woman yelling for help. She looked up. A flaming canister was headed her way. It was too late to duck. I figured, it's coming. Dundon closed her eyes. Hours after Dundon was injured, 21-year-old Sophia Wilansky, a recent graduate of Williams College, nearly had her left arm blown off by an explosive device. Dundon faced obstacles at every turn as she sought medical help, but Wilansky was flown to a Minneapolis hospital in the hours after the explosion. And Dundon's injury received a fraction of the attention given to journalist Erin Schrode, whose Facebook post of her injury from a rubber bullet received nearly 2.5 million views. He said he suffered severe bleeding from a wound that required seven staples to close. His injury also received little attention. Wilansky recognized the disparity in a recent Facebook post. She offered to donate some of the funds she has received to lesser-known victims of police violence. Dundon said, smiling. But it wasn't until September when she saw a video of dogs from a pipeline security team biting protesters that she decided to join them. She found a ride and traveled north to Standing Rock. Vanessa Dundon in October at the Dakota Access oil pipeline protest. She swapped her skirts and moccasins for the Marine and Army uniforms her veteran sisters had brought her from Arizona. Instinctively she covered it with a bandana. She tried to run but almost immediately felt a rubber bullet pierce her skin. She fell. No, they told her, you're just bleeding a lot. But Dundon's eye had been damaged, and in the crucial hours she had to save it, she found herself in a healthcare nightmare. After camp medics applied sutures to halt the bleeding, a Standing Rock ambulance took her to a clinic in Mandan, an hour's drive away. As she waited for attention, Dundon said, she overheard nurses talking about a Native man who'd been injured on the bridge. An hour later a doctor arrived and gave her stitches. He told her she needed to see a retina specialist immediately, but there were only three in the state. He recommended one in Fargo, 200 miles east. But they were unavailable over the Thanksgiving holiday. The next day, Dundon went to a retina clinic in Mandan. Clerks there refused to accept her Indian Health Service insurance card from Arizona. She called her mother, trying to connect the clinic with her Arizona benefits coordinator. This is 72 hours to save my eye. Vanessa Dundon Share quote & link Desperate for money, she returned to camp, where a drum group sang and a woman danced for her at the sacred fire. Her cousin then drove her four hours to Fargo, where she checked into an emergency room. But there was so much bleeding in her eye that it was impossible to determine the extent of the damage, she said. The next day, an ophthalmologist told her she probably had a detached retina. I'm on the front lines. I am very passionate. Morton County officials would not comment specifically on Dundon's case because of the lawsuit. However, they have consistently defended police tactics. Duncan said her anger goes far beyond the police. Injured, she was unable to get the quick medical help she needed.

On Monday evening, in the parking lot of a Ramada Inn in Bismarck, N.D., two white men in masks violently confronted a car driven by men from Standing Rock. As the men attempted to leave, they soon realized that multiple vehicles had deliberately blocked them in. Trapped, the masked men threatened to assault them then viciously bragged about sexually assaulting their wives. Partly because of the Facebook Live video filmed by one of the passengers in the car, the Bismarck Police Department just arrested one person, 33-year-old Jesse McLain, who was involved in the incident. While police have not said if McLain was one of the drivers, or planned it out, he was allegedly one of the two masked men yelling. The two vehicles on the scene, a 2014 Chevy Silverado and a 2006 Chevy cargo van, are presently registered to two other Bismarck residents, and the license plates were exposed for bystanders to film. Jesse D. McLain, 33, was charged with two counts of terrorizing after he allegedly was part of a confrontation in which two masked men harassed protestors of the Dakota Access pipeline outside a Ramada Inn Monday in Bismarck, North Dakota. (Bismarck Police Department) Thursday night, similar behavior continued. Three indigenous people driving near the reservation were confronted, harassed, and dangerously chased by a large pickup truck and masked men in snowmobiles. They also filmed it on Facebook Live. On multiple occasions the white men in the pickup truck and snowmobiles attempted to cut them off, and the chase at times neared 100 mph on dangerously icy and snow covered roads. In each instance, the indigenous men were overwhelmingly courteous, peaceful and patient while the white men were the lone aggressors. Anyone with the most basic knowledge of the civil rights movement or the history of the KKK is familiar with these types of confrontations. Masked white men have, for over 100 years, targeted and terrorized people of color using eerily similar methods. He is a descendant of Chief Matthew King, Noble Redman.

Jo-Ellen Darcy, The Army's Assistant Secretary for Civil Works, said in a statement that she intends on exploring an alternate route for the pipeline crossing. Vehicles would regularly be boxed in to make escaping difficult. Freedom Riders James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were confronted, kidnapped, and killed on such a dark Mississippi roadway in the summer of 1964. What shocks our collective conscience is that we wrongly thought that our nation had evolved or grown past such behavior, but violent and bigoted confrontations continue to grip the United States. These indigenous men who were confronted Thursday could've easily crashed and died as a result of that dangerous confrontation, and their names would've become etched in stone like the martyrs of racial violence from another era.

Sophia was heading to bring water to the unarmed people who were being attacked for several hours by Morton County Sheriff forces. around 4:30am after the police hit the bridge with water cannons and rubber bullets and pepper spray they lobbed a number of concussion grenades which are not supposed to be thrown at people directly at protesters or protectors as they want to be called. A grenade exploded right as it hit Sophia in the left forearm taking most of the undersurface of her left arm with it. Both her radial and ulnar artery were completely destroyed. Her radius was shattered and a large piece of it is missing. Her medial nerve is missing a large section as well. All of the muscle and soft tissue between her elbow and wrist were blown away. The police did not do this by accident - it was an intentional act of throwing it directly at her. Additionally police were shooting people in face and groin intending to do the most possible damage. Sophia will have surgery again tomorrow as bit by bit they try to rebuild a somewhat functioning arm and hand. The first surgery took a vein from her leg which they have implanted in her arm to take the place of the missing arteries. She will need multiple surgeries to try to gain some functional use of the arm and hand. She will be, every day for the foreseeable future, fearful of losing her arm and hand.

Keith Ellison is campaigning to chair the Democratic National Committee. If he wins, that opens up a congressional seat in a special election. And, state Rep. Peggy Flanagan is thinking about running. Now, the details. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minnesota. This is a victory for all people who fight for social justice. We use environmental impact statements to understand how key projects will impact our environment and communities. I hope that Energy Transfer Partners, and most importantly, the next Administration, recognize the concerns raised by the Standing Rock Tribe. I also want to acknowledge that the responsibility for this project falls on the Energy Transfer board room, not the workers who are simply trying to do their jobs. Working Americans need our support as well. We have a responsibility to respect the sovereignty of the Standing Rock Tribe, and to ensure their voices are heard. And we must ensure that the millions of people who depend on the Missouri and Cannonball rivers have access to clean water. This is not exactly the message we have been hearing from the Democratic National Committee. Instead, since the summer, when the presidential campaign was at its height, we heard statements about protecting peaceful protest and workers (without a definition of what was meant). That no longer works. If it ever did. In this age of social media and transparency, the people are demanding more accountability and a clear sense of direction about social justice. We can do that by meeting folks where they are, looking them in the eye, treating them with respect, and working to solve their problems. So that means Ellison (unlike former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Shultz) would give up his congressinal seat. Whoever wins the DNC chair race faces a lot of work, travel, planning and resource raising. Ellison was a strong candidate before his announcement last week. But since then he is earning more endorsements from elected Democrats. According to Politico, supporters now include: Reps. There are other potential candidates as well, including Labor Secretary Thomas Perez. Montana and Arizona could, should, have broken that barrier in 2016 by electing Denise Juneau and Victoria Steele. Sometimes elections require a bit more, well, luck. This is a place where voters would appreciate, even celebrate, the historical significance of this first. After all this is a state that just elected four Native women to its Legislature.

The legislation, which still needs to be considered by the state Senate, also would make it a misdemeanor to wear a mask while committing a crime. Rep. Terry Jones, R-New Town, said he and other members of the House Judiciary Committee carefully considered the proposals with the goal of protecting citizens' rights. The new charge would apply to situations such as pipeline protesters who attach themselves to equipment to stall construction of the pipeline. Opponents questioned whether a felony offense was appropriate. House Bill 1426 would elevate offenses such as instigating a riot of 100 or more people or providing firearms or weapons for a riot from a Class C felony to a Class B felony. Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Byers testified during the hearing that individuals can be guilty of engaging in a riot if they fail to disperse when ordered by law enforcement, even if they remain peaceful during the event. Jones said the proposal is modeled after how speeding tickets are issued in North Dakota and could reduce some of the cases that need to go through the court system. Lawmakers voted 69-22 in favor of House Bill 1304, which makes it a Class A misdemeanor to wear a mask while committing a crime or fleeing from a crime. The bill was amended from its initial proposal to address concerns about it being unconstitutional. The bill, which failed in a 11-79 vote, had language that was vague, overly broad and would not withstand constitutional challenges, said Rep. Shannon Roers Jones, R-Fargo. About 700 people have been arrested in connection with Dakota Access protest activity since Aug. 10.

Because we are a forgotten people, he says Moya-Smith: Media should pay more attention to shootings of Native Americans Editor's note: Simon Moya-Smith is a citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation and culture editor at Indian Country Today. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- As the country continues to debate police accountability and the all-too-routine killing of unarmed black men by white law enforcement, it's imperative to understand that this issue is not just about black people and white people. In fact, despite the available statistical evidence, most people don't know that Native Americans are most likely to be killed by police, compared with other racial groups. When Native Americans are shot and killed by law enforcement, there's rarely much news coverage of those incidents. There are no outcries from any community other than our own. Simon Moya-Smith There are no white or black faces rallying around us, marching with us, protesting with us over this injustice. Because we are a forgotten people. Take Mah-hi-vist Goodblanket, an 18-year-old Cheyenne and Arapaho youth, who died on December 21, 2013, after being shot seven times by two sheriff's deputies in Oklahoma. Since a grand jury declined to indict a New York police officer in the death of Garner, demonstrators across the country have taken to the streets to express their outrage. Garner, a 43-year-old asthmatic, died in July after he was put in a chokehold by the officer, Daniel Pantaleo. Custer County Sheriff's spokesman Bruce Peoples said Goodblanket threw a knife at the deputies and then attacked with another knife. They tried a Taser on him, which had no effect. But Goodblanket's girlfriend, Naomi Barron, who was present when he was killed, said in a statement that Goodblanket had no weapons when the two white deputies opened fire. His mother, Melissa, said he experienced an episode when he thought that his girlfriend was breaking up with him that fateful night. The attorney for the Goodblanket family, Ray Wall, said the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation has refused to release the police report regarding the incident. Goodblanket's mother, Melissa, said she can't comprehend why mainstream media does not report on the killings of unarmed Native Americans, and why the killing of her son has failed to spark a national response. But the outrage isn't to be found -- at least not outside of Native American communities. What's hard to believe is that the two white deputies both received the Medal of Honor and one received the Purple Heart by his department months after Goodblanket's death. Imagine if Darren Wilson or Daniel Pantaleo received commendations associated with the killing of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. There would be protests dwarfing any that have occurred to date. That doesn't seem to bother anyone but Native Americans. History provides various unjust examples. Just think of the 20 U.S. cavalrymen who were awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor after they indiscriminately murdered an estimated 300 Lakota -- 200 of whom were women and children -- during the Wounded Knee Massacre on December 29, 1890. Those medals have yet to be rescinded. Many old Western movies from Hollywood didn't portray Native Americans in a positive light. Contemporary designers such as Ralph Lauren continue to sell clothes with images of dead Indians emblazoned on them. We've all seem them -- it's the image of a skull donning a feather headdress. There's another incident recently that outraged the Native American community. On October 4 in Pierre, South Dakota, four officers surrounded an irate 70-pound Sicangu Lakota girl and tased her after concern that she would harm herself with a knife. Though this outrageous incident was covered by CNN and other networks, the killing of Goodblanket and many other Native Americans who've died at the hands of law enforcement remains unspoken. Utilizing the hashtag, users compared instances of white people receiving little or no punishments for crimes they had committed, whereas African-Americans were dealt harshly disproportionate sentences for theirs. Yet some people want to claim that we've grown much as a nation. On the day when white law enforcement officers are indicted for the killing of unarmed black men, and on the day when white men stop receiving medals associated with the killing of Native Americans, then I will say we've grown as a nation, but only a little. We will still have a long way to go.

He was later removed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Photo courtesy of Ryan Redhawk Bismarck Tribune on Mar 28, 2017 Authorities used news footage and social media, but did not interview protester witnesses, when they charged three men with endangering and terrorizing an armed pipeline security worker on Oct. During a preliminary hearing on Monday, Bureau of Criminal Investigations Special Agent Scott Betz repeatedly referenced a KX News video and Facebook posts as he testified in support of charges against Brennon Nastacio, 36, and Michael Fasig, 46. Fasig and Israel Hernandez, 22, who waived his hearing Monday, are charged with felony reckless endangerment and criminal mischief. Nastacio is charged with felony terrorizing. The men pleaded not guilty, and the case was set for trial in October. Nastacio allegedly walked toward the man with a knife. No charges have been filed against the security worker, Kyle Thompson, who disguised himself as a protester with a bandanna over his face in order to take photos of burning equipment and carried a loaded assault rifle and handgun in his unmarked truck, according to Betz. He also apparently tried to raise money on a GoFundMe account for repairs. After he was charged, Betz interviewed Fasig over the phone. Fasig allegedly told him that he was not the one driving the car. Betz said he identified Nastacio from the KX News video, where he apparently holds a knife up by his head for one to three seconds as he walks toward Thompson. One protester sent in a statement about what he witnessed just north of the main Oceti Sakowin camp, but Betz said he was unable to reach him when he left one phone message. Though Betz did not interview any protesters about the incident, he talked to Thompson, who indicated he feared for his life. Thompson said he drove to Highway 1806 to check on burning equipment. During this time, two vehicles struck his car, disabling it. He got out of the vehicle with an assault rifle he had in the truck and walked toward the water where he was surrounded by some protesters with knives, he told Betz. Betz said Thompson had the gun pointed down and did not fire it, though a crime lab investigation could not be certain. Betz said Thompson did not indicate why he fled the protesters or walked into the water. Defense attorneys Tyrone Turner and Bruce Nestor indicated in their cross-examination of Betz that they would argue at trial that the men feared for their lives and the lives of others near them.

Four hundred people walk slowly in a light snow to the river by the camp. A teacher is talking. His headdress is a crisscrossing of long, narrow feathers. He is of the Havasupai, the people who live by the blue-green waterfalls at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. He calls out across the river. They run around in the mud and ice. There are 80 tribes here. Some say many more. The Earth-force is represented by this river and these eagles and these water protectors. We see the Money-force, standing over there on the bridge, just a couple hundred feet from the edge of long meadow of white tipis along the Cannonball River. The police look like a long row of Darth Vaders. In the environmental movement, we have yearned for the success of the Civil Rights and the Gender Rights movements. Few of us, though, face the police like the freedom-fighters of old. As environmentalists we fall back on soft confrontation dominated by data. Data is bloodless. Lobbying, position papers, endless graphics and electronic petitions might as well be abandoned in the age of Trump.

The transformation of Standing Rock needs to be carried to many towns and cities. We need to press up against militarized and consumerized citizens at all points, and then convert them to life. Suddenly there is clarity for Earth activists. With extinction accelerating and climate changing, we must transform with the intensity that one associates with religion. We have the time if we take the time. Three movements in recent years galvanize us. In these citizen movements we did take the time, took the risk, and made a difference. Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter and Standing Rock. The lesson in all of them, the thing they have in common is that so many changed their own individual lives in order that they could then change the rest of us. In all three, the spiritual element is carried by the act of living together, literally living together, without the supervision of the corporations or government. Here is where activists cared for each other and shared food, clothing and medicine. The force that upsets entrenched power the most is this compassionate living, this community in plain sight. Standing Rock offers us our moment of clarity. We can physically commit now. We must face the Devil. It is life and death. And living actively in a time of life and death must be a spiritual act. It should be you and I in service getting something done, in our daily life. Public caring and going through the quasi-religious transformation must go hand in hand. It was always so, from Pettis Bridge to Stonewall. When we are at peace with the Earth, we are able to hold our ground. The ground is the point. We hold our ground and the Earth holds us. In prison and in pain and in loss the Earth holds us. Give Reverend Billy Talen a round of applause.

Four hundred people walk slowly in a light snow to the river by the camp. A teacher is talking. His headdress is a crisscrossing of long, narrow feathers. He is of the Havasupai, the people who live by the blue-green waterfalls at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. He calls out across the river. They run around in the mud and ice. There are 80 tribes here. Some say many more. Earth-force is represented by this river and these eagles and these water protectors. We see the Money-force, standing over there on the bridge, just a couple hundred feet from the edge of long meadow of white tipis along the Cannonball River.

And Columbus, while remembered as a hero by many, was brutal to the native people. In his quest to find gold, he enslaved them, working thousands to death; brutalized them; and murdered them. The native population was nearly wiped out. By 1550, there were five hundred. Native Americans in what is now the United States would continue to be killed by later settlers in enormous numbers, have their land stolen by the government, and see their rights trampled on. Poverty and employment In 2012, one in four American Indians and Alaska Natives lived in poverty, compared to a national rate of 14.5 percent. For those who identify these groups as their only race, their poverty rate was just over 29 percent. Poverty rates are even higher on big Indian reservations: Among the top ten largest, rates range from 20.2 percent for individuals to as much as 53.5 percent. And extreme poverty on these reservations is, on average, four times as high as the national rate. Advertisement On top of these high poverty rates, Native Americans experience far higher unemployment rates. The unemployment situation right now is four times worse among the Native American population than it was for the entire country during the recession. The employment rate for the native population in its prime working ages was less than 65 percent between 2009 and 2011, 13.4 points lower than for white workers. During the same time, the Native American unemployment rate averaged 14.6 percent, nearly 7 points higher than the 7.7 percent rate for white workers. Things have been bad for a while: Native Americans have suffered double-digit unemployment rates ever since 2008, with a current rate around 11 percent, compared to a national rate under 6 percent. Education The achievement gap between students of color and white students has been steadily closing, but not for Native students. Native Americans, including American Indians and Alaska Natives, have seen their gaps widen. In 2011, 18 percent of Native fourth graders were proficient or advanced in reading on the National Assessment of Education Progress, compared to 42 percent of white fourth grades, a gap that has stayed flat since 2005. Just 17 percent of Native eighth graders scored at those levels in math, compared to 43 percent of white ones. Other racial groups saw improvements during that time that far outpaced Native students. Beyond middle school, less than 70 percent of Native students graduate high school in four years, compared to 83 percent of white students. Only a quarter score at a college-ready level on the ACT math and a third on reading, compared to half and two-thirds of white students, respectively. Just half of Native students enroll in college, compared to three-quarters of white students, and once there less than 40 percent of Native students will compete a four-year college degree in four years, compared to 62 percent of whites. But that aid has been cut. Health Life expectancy for American Indians and Alaska Natives is 4.2 years less than for the American population as a whole; they die at 368 percent higher rate of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis and a 177 percent higher rate from diabetes. They also have an 82 percent higher rate of dying from assault or homicide and 65 percent higher rate of dying from suicide. Over 13 percent of Native Americans report being in fair or poor health, much higher than for other groups. Advertisement An important cause of these gaps is that they have less access to high-quality health care. More than a third of Native Americans lack health insurance, compared to the national rate of 17.2 percent. The Indian Health Service was funded at just 54 percent of what was needed in 1999."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/249531602t?referring_akid=.4270520.mQpujZ", "Timestamp": "20180918223514", "Sentences": "Credo Action Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument.

This editorial is from a request by elders from both Standing Rock and Pine Ridge Reservations regarding the camp at Cannonball. This camp started as a spiritual camp whose purpose was to pray for good water for the people. The next step then is to trust that your prayers were heard. You go home and go on with your life knowing that your prayers will be answered. You need to do this so you will be out of the way of whatever the Creator has in mind. You need to get out of the way to let the miracle happen. In the past 14 years, I have seen this happen many, many times. I'll tell you the most recent example. Last April, 2016, we had a small prayer gathering to ask the Creator to keep all the minerals, oil, Uranium, coal, gold, silver, etc., to keep them in the ground where they belong as they are there for a reason. American and European people and western science doesn't understand that these things are where they are located for a reason that human beings don't necessarily need to know. So we prayed to help Mother Earth to be healthy by keeping all these things in the ground where they belong. We had lunch. Then we went home. It might be even less today. This price is almost half as much as is needed just to dig the Uranium out of the ground. Our little handful of people praying together last April did not have the ability to change the world wide price, or even to think of such a thing. We got out of Their way. To do this means trusting that your prayers were heard, and not just for good water at Standing Rock, but for good water all over the world. It means having patience to wait for whatever the Creator has in mind. It means trusting that the Maker of innumerable universes is wiser, knows more, sees more, and can accomplish much more than mere human beings. It means being humble in waiting for the answer to your prayers. Elders who have seen and experienced these miracles, and who give their requests need to be heard. The elders are requesting now that it is time to break camp at Cannonball, go home, and trust that your prayers have been heard. It might not be in a way you thought of, but it will be in a much better way. Charmaine White Face, age 69, is Oglala Tituwan Oceti Sakowin, a writer and great-grandmother.

They were, supposedly, the party of progressive values. Unfortunately, that argument is muddied by numerous policies Democratic administrations and Congresses have pushed through over the years that have proved detrimental to the most vulnerable members of our society. Bill Clinton championing and signing off on the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act comes to mind, as does his signing NAFTA into law in 1993. The Democratic Party as a whole also shunned the Black Lives Matter movement for the most part. This is not to say that the Democratic Party has never done any good. It has. The party needs to learn that before the next election. Amidst this ongoing history of giving only to take away, this endless cycle of hope and disappointment, we now have to witness the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline unfold at Standing Rock. For nearly nine months we have watched militarized police officers decked out in riot gear gear and flanked by armored vehicles attack unarmed and nonviolent Native Americans and their allies with tear gas, paper spray, sonic weapons, rubber bullets, bean-bag guns, and tasers. We have seen them beat men and women with batons and billy clubs before dragging them off to jail, temporarily locking them in dog kennels, according to reports from Salon and others. Sunday night, the police escalated the brutality of their violence by intentionally spraying protestors with water cannons as the temperatures dropped into the 20s, The Intercept reported. They simultaneously fired tear gas and pepper spray at them. Neither side wants to take responsibility. The activists of the Civil Rights Movement were fighting for basic human rights. Water is a basic human right. The Dakota Access Pipeline threatens the supplies of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux and millions of other people in the region. This has been acknowledged by several agencies, including the Army Corps of Engineers, which fast-tracked construction of the pipeline, according to a report from the Seattle Times. In fact, the Army Corps of Engineers rerouted the original path of the pipeline due to concerns that it might contaminate the water supplies of cities it passed by. They chose to endanger the water of the Sioux and others instead. They have a right to protest and to protect themselves. Native Americans are among the most marginalized people in America. The Democrats want us to believe that they are there for those who need them, that they will protect the most vulnerable among us. Obama has spoken on the matter. Everyday construction continues is another day closer to their permanently losing this battle. This is one of the progressive issues of the moment. Obama and the Democratic Party must take action on the Dakota Access Pipeline right now if they want to start to win back progressive voters. The Democrats should know that by now."}, {"URL": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2017/01/25/trump_s_budget_pick_didn_t_pay_taxes_on_his_nanny_because_he_didn_t_think.html", "Timestamp": "20180918224742", "Sentences": "Nah.

And, so confusingly, every evening she would leave her job and then, get this, return the next morning. But given his devotion to tax-related causes, this seems unlikely. Unfortunately, we rarely hear about the way under-the-table compensation damages employees as individuals and degrades their profession. A nanny, or any other type of domestic worker, paid under the table is ineligible for Social Security, unemployment insurance, and Medicare benefits. An unofficial status makes them less able to seek recourse for workplace harassment or mistreatment, as well. These are understandable positions to take, considering the high financial burden child care places on families and the low compensation many who do this work must budget their lives around. What would work is making sure everyone has access to affordable and high-quality child care. We need legislation to make this happen, but before that can happen we need those in charge to view care work as legitimate labor. This should be grounds for Congress to vote against his nomination.

These historical protests regarding the right to water, are not receiving adequate news coverage, especially in light of an impending order from the governor to remove protesters from the camp. The recent announcement of the clearing of protesters came a day after Thanksgiving, a holiday related to the oppression of native communities in America. The truth behind thanksgiving is that in 1637, over 700 men, women, and children were massacred by the English and Dutch colonists. This important part of history not widely accepted in America, the holiday is centered around the false narrative of victory and celebration. Americans enjoy their freedoms, including their free-flowing water -- often taken for granted due to easy access. Meanwhile, Native Americans are being beaten, gassed and shot in North Dakota. The violent crackdowns by law enforcement and private contractors are a violation of human rights. Violence against peaceful protests is usually condemned by the U.S. government when it is taking place in a foreign nation. These violations have prompted a United Nations investigation into the violence that has been taking place at Standing Rock. The Obama administration has failed to protect peaceful protesters, sacred native lands, and more importantly has failed to protect vital water sources. With recent advances in clean energy and the huge drop in oil prices, large costly pipelines are unnecessary. They pose a huge risk to the environment, outweighing any monetary gains the big oil companies may see from these pipelines. With recent advancements in wind, solar, hydro, and other types of clean energy, and the recent losses of the oil and gas industry, the U.S. should shift its focus away from oil and gas production. With three this month alone, and more than 3,032 since 2006. Often times these cleanup efforts are ineffective and have lasting damage to ecosystems, habitats, wildlife, drinking water, which endanger the American people. On average after all the cleanup efforts which only partially does the job, roughly 31,000 barrels of oil are not able to be cleaned up per year. A recent report states that two law enforcement officials have turned in their badges, in regards to the tactics and violence being used against peaceful protesters. The tactics being used are unprecedented against peaceful protests in the United States, with over 300 people injured and reportedly 26 people being hospitalized. Meanwhile, there are over 1,000 U.S. veterans mobilizing to continue their duty to protect the American people, as they will deploy to Standing Rock on Dec 4th. The Obama administration has failed to protect peaceful protesters, sacred native lands, and more importantly has failed to protect vital water sources. Over his two terms, President Obama has spoken on protecting native land; made campaign promises to change the U.S.-native relations, and declared November as Native American Heritage month, such actions mean very little in due to his inaction on this issue. Obama needs to take action to de-escalate the situation at Standing Rock, and uphold the rights of the protesters. In light of the recent election, it is being reported Donald Trump owns a stake in the parent company building the pipeline. Trump faces a number of conflict of interests this being no different, recently the CEO of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners Kelcy Warren, was quoted telling the Associated Press it is an expectation that Trump will make it easier for such projects to be completed. The pipeline would almost certainly be completed under a Trump Administration. He has stated publicly that global warming is a ploy by the Chinese, and has expressed support for the oil and gas industry. A previous plan for the pipeline had the route crossing the Missouri river, the neighbourhoods of Bismark North Dakota spoke out about the damage a leak could cause to their water supply. This pipeline endangers the main water source for many, with water being a necessity for life, there has been speculation of a possible reroute. A recent report published states that if the January 1st deadline for completion is not met this could place the entire pipeline in Limbo, as contracts will have to be renegotiated between contractors and investors.

But just being here, the experience, meeting everyone, it's nice to know that there are a lot of people to support us, to support Standing Rock. that's what I was saying, I'm so happy. I'm Navajo from Arizona. two months. What really drove me here was to do something that's a passion, because I've been protecting the water in Arizona, trying to protect my local rivers, but that really didn't work out. It got polluted. I just don't wanna see another oil spill happen because you can't clean oil. first of all, I never liked the media. You feel everybody's energy, you feel everybody's presence here. It's very heartwarming cause out in the streets, when I walk around, people don't even say hello or smile, but here it's like that all the time. I don't know; it's really touching because I never was a people person, but now I'm realizing, I don't know, this is home. And second, I don't agree with Trump being in office. been here for ten days now. Where I come from in California, our addiction to fossil fuels affects us physically and psychologically. The day-to-day habitual usage of 'car living' and 'sitting in traffic' has isolated our people and hinders our community. So, I spent a couple of months not using fossil fuel transportation and traveled a couple hundred miles through California. I only got in a car to come here. At least, I hope we'll stop it soon. Our consumerist attitude hurts our souls more than we even realize. Many of us don't choose to acknowledge the fact that we are constantly at war for our resources. We need to realize that the best things in life are free: sunrises, clean water, clean air. So, I would like to let the American public know that if they spent less time driving, more time walking; less time consuming, more time repairing the things that they have, that they would be happier and healthier. I think we are on the brink of this realization. I've seen the pictures of my ancestors. been here about two weeks. I'll only be here a couple more days. There are many leaders here. I think the media isn't picking up that the matriarchs are very powerful in their message. They're having to fight through the patriarchal civilization, society, even within the Lakota nation, to get the message out. We have to return to the matriarchy, and if you want to know the new age, this is the Age of Aquarius. And stand up for yourselves. You're standing up for my child and I really appreciate that. I got here in early September. I was here before, I had my mother with me, and I was doing it for her and for my daughter. My daughter's nine, my mother's 74. I'm here and taking care of my kid. I have to support myself and my daughter and that's pretty much the women's role here. I can't imagine the women with five kids, there's a woman here with six boys and a husband. first trip here was from September 9 to 11. I came just for a short visit. After that I couldn't stop thinking about it. So about a month later I came back for a week. After that second visit, going home, again, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I just jumped in the car and came right back. We've been here for a week this time. Men and women are so different from each other, and so everyone has a separate, but just as valuable, role in this society's way of being. necessary. Our culture is not a trend. It's very real wisdom about how to live on this land and I really do feel like the knowledge of how we, as a society, move forward, remains with the indigenous people. It's not just some spiritual mumbo-jumbo. All living beings need this in their life. We all need to know, we are all pure and indigenous, our ancestors live and thrive within us. But mainly there needs to be clarity about what the issue is. Some people don't understand that the treaty, the Fort Laramie Treaty, granting the right to all of this land that we see from far beyond where the burned land is over there. This movement, in part, is to restore the relationship of the indigenous people to our land and to our water. From personal testimonies heard, it took the fire department eight hours to respond. I was here that first weekend that people were arrested. Police serve the people, so police should be protecting the water protectors. I don't know, I thought it was a really brilliant perspective for a veteran to be here. This is not only an area concern for the people around here, but it should be a concern for everybody who lives in the US. We are united through the American Indian movement. She's been here in honor of her mom, who passed away, I believe in July. She passed away from cancer, so Red Fawn decided that she wanted to come up here and fight in honor of her mother, so she's been pretty active and well-known through the community here. She's very loving, caring, and speaks her mind, and will always try to stand up for what's right. She was at the front line and she was one of the first Oglala's to be arrested. They knew who she was, especially because she has a strong voice and is always talking to the police officers. I don't know exactly what happened, but I know that she was singled out, they followed her, some officers, and they beat her. You can see pictures of her; her face is beat up. Then the police said that they heard shots fired to cover it up. There's a line, and if you don't cross the line, you won't be arrested. If you crossed the line, you knew you were going to be arrested. It was nonviolent, completely nonviolent. This time she was up there as a medic, she's walking away from the line, she's retreating and then they go and they grab her. Six officers start beating her, and then they release the rubber bullets. She was shot close range, three to six times. So, I don't know if they were saying that they found a gun on her to justify how badly her face was beaten. September I was out here for about a week. I didn't feel complete when I left. I felt like I had left a huge part of me here. I felt that I needed to come back to find it and refigure everything out. Serrano. We call it Yuhaviatam in California. I wish that people would actually care about it. I wish that people would see the colonization that's happening in front of them, the deprivation of people's rights. wish that more people would come, more people that could help. We need workers here. A lot of people are calling it Woodstock, and it's not a Woodstock, it's not a place where we can all go have our own personal downtime. Let's bring hands and get this job done. It was beautiful. My tribe is also at risk, we are the brother tribe, bordering the Standing Rock Sioux on our north side. Reservation life is hopeless with a lack of opportunity. Messed up roads, long miles in-between communities with little or no services. Federal funds are limited, with so many strings attached, we can hardly use the money. There is so much death from suicide, kidney failure, cancer. But we survive. We make the best of it. We cling to our culture. Our language is dying but we are protecting it. Our environment is threatened by carcinogenic contamination from mercury, arsenic, and other chemicals used in oil pipelines, gold extraction. All of this is our environment, but we live on. So, I'm Chumash from California, the central southern coast. I live in Oakland right now, and for the last year I've been working with the Indigenous Peoples Power Project (IP3), and it's really picked up for this, obviously. So, what I'm doing out here is just supporting and helping, also training in nonviolent direct action. For every day that isn't an action day, we have training at 2pm. But even beyond that, I think there's a larger goal. There's a lot of healing that needs to happen in Indian Country and I think that this is all part of it. All of these nations coming together, standing up together, saying we are powerful, and we've been here, and we've resisted, and we survived, and we're still surviving, and we're very much alive, we're not a myth. You can come in from one side of the Oceti Sakowin Camp, but the other side is blocked off, and around a hill that always looked to lead nowhere. On one side is the Oceti Sakowin Camp, the kids, the people, and on the other side is a fleet of police, the two separated by a short bridge and a barricade of old burnt car parts. Mary spoke openly to the group of journalists, reporters, children, and family, leading us closer and closer to the barricade. Finally stopping at the bridge that set us a few 100 feet back from the wall of cars, she spoke with determination. Our spirits come from the oneness. So it's a testimony that you see every color as you turn your head, and what even makes it more enriching is that you're young. It's no longer the elders or somebody that has to have a high-stature age category to stand up for us. You carry the water and the water has memory. You have their DNA. So when you feel alone, you're not. When you feel weak, you get this awakening of your ancestors in you that says you're not alone. We have survived since the beginning of time and we're gonna continue that survival. So you can keep those future generations whispering their names from years before. We will prevail. The woman looked at me and told me that his story needed to be heard. Fifteen minutes later, he passed away. Today is his birthday. He's four years old today. Right now, it's kind of a hard time, but I want to do that to honor him. I love my nephews and nieces with all of my heart. I love my family with all my heart. I'm here to fight for them and their future. I want them to have clean water. So if I have to die during the fight, so be it, because I'd die for my nephews and nieces, my grandchildren, and all our future generations ahead. I'd die for them. I'm ready to meet my nephew. my god, they're amazing. It's not just this movement, but they wanna move forward with things after this movement, to help continue to make this place sacred. Not even this specific place, but Planet Earth, Mother Earth. They're working hard to find unity. It's amazing because they're the ones leading these peaceful protecting marches, going up to the front lines, offering the officers blessed and sacred water, just as a gift of kindness. mom is originally from here, from Cannon Ball.

In the second part of their coverage, Kate and Amber speak directly to the water protectors about their reasons for being at Standing Rock, what the movement means to them, and what they want the world to know about it. My mom is originally from here, from Cannon Ball. When the DAPL thing started, they asked for women and children to be there. The kids were there; they didn't understand what was going on at the time, so now we've told them. We've been here since then. We'll be going home soon. We'll probably leave in maybe the next week or two. We can't stay for winter; we're not really equipped to stay for the winters here in North Dakota. Yeah, we've just been in a tent the whole time, and this is fourth tent we've been in. The wind is the worst in North Dakota. I just think it's wrong, you know, what they're doing. What American greed does to people, does to my reservation. But just being here, the experience, meeting everyone, it's nice to know that there are a lot of people to support us, to support Standing Rock. I feel like I'm really proud that we were the last nation, and the first to bring all these people back together. That's beautiful. So, that's what I was saying, I'm so happy. I'm glad to be from Standing Rock. My name is Frankie Tso Junior. I'm Navajo from Arizona. My native name is Grass Buffalo. About two months. What really drove me here was to do something that's a passion, because I've been protecting the water in Arizona, trying to protect my local rivers, but that really didn't work out. It got polluted. I just don't wanna see another oil spill happen because you can't clean oil. Well, first of all, I never liked the media. But now I'm starting to realize that there's good media, like you guys, because you guys are getting the right word out, instead of them saying that we're a bunch of protesting terrorists on our own land. That's just stupid. But the first thing I wanna say, is that you have to come here and see for yourself. You feel everybody's energy, you feel everybody's presence here. It's very heartwarming cause out in the streets, when I walk around, people don't even say hello or smile, but here it's like that all the time. I don't know; it's really touching because I never was a people person, but now I'm realizing, I don't know, this is home. Yeah, exactly. First of all, I don't agree with Trump being in office. And second, I don't agree with Trump being in office. And third, I don't agree with Trump being in office. I've been here for ten days now. Where I come from in California, our addiction to fossil fuels affects us physically and psychologically. The day-to-day habitual usage of 'car living' and 'sitting in traffic' has isolated our people and hinders our community. So, I spent a couple of months not using fossil fuel transportation and traveled a couple hundred miles through California. I only got in a car to come here. I came out of frustration of the injustices that our Native American friends suffer. Well, a lot of people like to say, 'I'll be here through the whole winter,' and there's a power in that statement, but I prefer to say that I'll be gone next week, because I think that we are gonna stop this thing soon. At least, I hope we'll stop it soon. Hopefully I'll be able to leave with our mission complete in the next couple of days. I think they should be aware that so many of the products that we use are coming from dirty sources. Our consumerist attitude hurts our souls more than we even realize. Many of us don't choose to acknowledge the fact that we are constantly at war for our resources. We need to realize that the best things in life are free: sunrises, clean water, clean air. So, I would like to let the American public know that if they spent less time driving, more time walking; less time consuming, more time repairing the things that they have, that they would be happier and healthier. I think we are on the brink of this realization. I have three different tribes; I'm also very much European. I've seen the pictures of my ancestors. There was a lot of shame, that information isn't right there for me because it was shamed. I've been here about two weeks. I'll only be here a couple more days. I'm with a non-profit out of California and we've been funnelling supplies and money into here since late August. There's a lot of confusion here. There are many leaders here. I think the media isn't picking up that the matriarchs are very powerful in their message. They're having to fight through the patriarchal civilization, society, even within the Lakota nation, to get the message out. We have to return to the matriarchy, and if you want to know the new age, this is the Age of Aquarius. Women have to start right at home. And men need to support that. Good men will follow great women. And stand up for yourselves. You're standing up for my child and I really appreciate that. I'm a member of the Oglala tribe. I got here in early September. I plan on staying until we defeat the black snake. When I was here before, I had my mother with me, and I was doing it for her and for my daughter. My daughter's nine, my mother's 74. They named it the black snake because there was a prophecy about this, and they talked about it, that we're going to have to a face a black snake someday. This was a long time ago, a hundred years ago, I forget who said it, but there was more than one Indian who prophezied this. It's a lot to take on. I'm here and taking care of my kid. I have to support myself and my daughter and that's pretty much the women's role here. I can't imagine the women with five kids, there's a woman here with six boys and a husband. So she has a man, and all her boys, and then she's running around being on the front line, then we have to cook, we have to take care of camp, a lot of us are cutting wood. My first trip here was from September 9 to 11. I came just for a short visit. After that I couldn't stop thinking about it. So about a month later I came back for a week. After that second visit, going home, again, I couldn't stop thinking about it. I just jumped in the car and came right back. We've been here for a week this time. Yeah, Jemez Pueblo. My experience has very much been like womanhood, motherhood, understanding our roles in society as women. Men and women are so different from each other, and so everyone has a separate, but just as valuable, role in this society's way of being. So that balance of the masculine and feminine is something that I've begun to understand. Both the men and the women play very strong roles, are working all day in different ways. Both of these forces are needed. And necessary. When you live with each other and are working as a community to make food every day and to stay warm together every night, you know, you appreciate people, even the smallest job that anyone does. Our culture is not a novelty. Right, right, it's not a trend. Our culture is not a trend. It's very real wisdom about how to live on this land and I really do feel like the knowledge of how we, as a society, move forward, remains with the indigenous people. It's not just some spiritual mumbo-jumbo. The transition to a more sustainable future starts here and it starts with looking back and paying attention to the indigenous knowledge and traditions. My DNA resides in the Navajo and Cherokee bloodline. I arrived at my camp the beginning of September, planning to visit a couple of days, but found myself staying since. The people and frequency here is euphoric and grounding. All living beings need this in their life. We all need to know, we are all pure and indigenous, our ancestors live and thrive within us. Every one of us. Arrow Woman: The need for treaties to be honored. Jacqueline: I just wanna make sure that my grandkids and my grandkids's grandkids, as well as everybody else, have the right to clean water. A lot of media reports focus on making it look violent. Arrow Woman: The media are coming out with a lot of controversial things. But mainly there needs to be clarity about what the issue is. Some people don't understand that the treaty, the Fort Laramie Treaty, granting the right to all of this land that we see from far beyond where the burned land is over there. This movement, in part, is to restore the relationship of the indigenous people to our land and to our water. I just want people to be informed and know that this is a human rights issue, not just an indigenous rights issue. Jacqueline: You also have environmental racism because this was originally meant to go through north of Bismarck and because of the community's outrage on that, they rerouted it to come through and impact our drinking water. There's so many different things happening: racism, environmental racism, mistreatment of indigenous people. Arrow Woman: We should explain what we were talking about where they bulldozed the burial sites. Jacqueline: It was a Friday night. They came in and they weren't digging, they just bulldozed, they just leveled the ground like five miles wide. Arrow Woman: So, that's why there are reports that there's no evidence of sacred sites. My husband is a firefighter in Denver, and I told him that and he said that's complete neglect, even for a rural community, it's absolutely unbelievable. From personal testimonies heard, it took the fire department eight hours to respond. The fire could have easily crossed over the road and into the camp, where hundreds of people are staying. I was speaking to someone who actually called the fire department. He had the times written down that he called. He said he called about midnight, they didn't respond till 8 am. Yes. It's disgusting. Arrow Woman: It's hard to believe that with all of the drones and all of the helicopters we see above us right now, with all of their surveillance, it's hard to believe that they didn't catch the description of that man who was driving, whatever vehicle he was in, or his license plate. Especially with all the police around. Arrow Woman: From my own personal experience, I have not seen any water protectors act in aggression or violence. But of course, there's a concern that a person who is pro-DAPL has infiltrated and caused some of those aggressive situations. Jacqueline: I was here that first weekend that people were arrested. There's a video of her getting arrested, so she's just standing there and the cops are in full-militarized gear and this is what the tone of the 'protests' were. Arrow Woman: Also, I actually had a really great conversation with a US veteran of 20 years this morning, and he says he can't afford to be arrested, but when he goes on the front lines, if he does see a crime happen from police officers doing something wrong to civilians, he will intercede and stop it because he feels he's still in service. Police serve the people, so police should be protecting the water protectors. I don't know, I thought it was a really brilliant perspective for a veteran to be here. He could lose his benefits if he's arrested. I'm so sorry, for what is happening here. Jacqueline: This is not only an area concern for the people around here, but it should be a concern for everybody who lives in the US. But it is good to know that we have national support from different areas of the world. For context, I stopped recording, but then a woman who originally did not choose to participate in the conversation asked if I'd heard about Red Fawn. I've seen a lot about her. I wanted to ask someone, I just didn't know if it was sensitive. We are united through the American Indian movement. She's been here in honor of her mom, who passed away, I believe in July. She passed away from cancer, so Red Fawn decided that she wanted to come up here and fight in honor of her mother, so she's been pretty active and well-known through the community here. She's very loving, caring, and speaks her mind, and will always try to stand up for what's right. She was at the front line and she was one of the first Oglala's to be arrested. Arrow Woman: Law enforcement. Jacqueline: They manhandled her and arrested her, so that was the second time. They knew who she was, especially because she has a strong voice and is always talking to the police officers. I don't know exactly what happened, but I know that she was singled out, they followed her, some officers, and they beat her. You can see pictures of her; her face is beat up. Then the police said that they heard shots fired to cover it up. They took the opportunity to target her. Anonymous: There's a line, and if you don't cross the line, you won't be arrested. If you crossed the line, you knew you were going to be arrested. It was nonviolent, completely nonviolent. This time she was up there as a medic, she's walking away from the line, she's retreating and then they go and they grab her. Six officers start beating her, and then they release the rubber bullets. She was shot close range, three to six times. So, I don't know if they were saying that they found a gun on her to justify how badly her face was beaten. It just kind of seems like they're using her now to make inaccurate media reports. Arrow Woman: They needed that story; it was for themselves. Somewhere between a week and two weeks ago. It's my second trip out here. In September I was out here for about a week. I didn't feel complete when I left. I felt like I had left a huge part of me here. I felt that I needed to come back to find it and refigure everything out. I couldn't just leave without it having been seen it through, it's like unfinished business. The time I spent here was really peaceful, but when I got back to Portland I heard that one of the camps got raided, it hit me really hard. So I just kind of figured everything out on my end, closed the lease on my house, moved all my stuff into storage, and just came out here and brought my dog. Yeah, I have some cousins that came in, just today. I'm Serrano. We call it Yuhaviatam in California. My sister's gonna be here next weekend, and the cousins, we'll be a pretty big family out here. You know, I just wish that it would be covered properly. I wish that people would actually care about it. I wish that people would see the colonization that's happening in front of them, the deprivation of people's rights. I wish that we can all kind of see that and have some sort of collective care for it and we don't have that. Some sort of humanity. Some sort, any sort. I wish that more people would come, more people that could help. We need workers here. A lot of people are calling it Woodstock, and it's not a Woodstock, it's not a place where we can all go have our own personal downtime. Let's bring hands and get this job done. Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. I think it was back in July, mid-summer. It was beautiful. The night sky was amazing. I was very happy to see so many tribes come together for one cause, to save Mother Earth and our water source. My tribe is also at risk, we are the brother tribe, bordering the Standing Rock Sioux on our north side. Our water intake is only 70 miles down the lake. That treaties are a contract between the US and the Sioux Nation. The Dakota Access Pipeline encroached about 23 miles into our treaty lands north of the Standing Rock reservation. Reservation life is hopeless with a lack of opportunity. Messed up roads, long miles in-between communities with little or no services. Federal funds are limited, with so many strings attached, we can hardly use the money. There is so much death from suicide, kidney failure, cancer. But we survive. We make the best of it. We cling to our culture. Our language is dying but we are protecting it. Our environment is threatened by carcinogenic contamination from mercury, arsenic, and other chemicals used in oil pipelines, gold extraction. All of this is our environment, but we live on. We must. It references a time when the United States government attempted to assimilate Native Americans into western schooling by stripping them of their culture, languages, and indigenous education. Just over a week ago. I'll be here for another week or two. Sure. So, I'm Chumash from California, the central southern coast. I live in Oakland right now, and for the last year I've been working with the Indigenous Peoples Power Project (IP3), and it's really picked up for this, obviously. So, what I'm doing out here is just supporting and helping, also training in nonviolent direct action. For every day that isn't an action day, we have training at 2pm. That's basically for everyone who's just showing up at camp to get an orientation so that they can go out on the line as water protectors. That this is all about stopping the pipeline. But even beyond that, I think there's a larger goal. There's a lot of healing that needs to happen in Indian Country and I think that this is all part of it. All of these nations coming together, standing up together, saying we are powerful, and we've been here, and we've resisted, and we survived, and we're still surviving, and we're very much alive, we're not a myth. The unity and power from this camp is so amazing and important. Mary Lyons We had heard that there were buffalo crossing the road, which is what drew us to the site in the first place. You can come in from one side of the Oceti Sakowin Camp, but the other side is blocked off, and around a hill that always looked to lead nowhere. On one side is the Oceti Sakowin Camp, the kids, the people, and on the other side is a fleet of police, the two separated by a short bridge and a barricade of old burnt car parts. Mary spoke openly to the group of journalists, reporters, children, and family, leading us closer and closer to the barricade. Finally stopping at the bridge that set us a few 100 feet back from the wall of cars, she spoke with determination. As she spoke, two men poured sacred water onto the hill and a cop used a mirror to reflect light on the ceremony. Our spirits do not have boundaries. Our spirits come from the oneness. So it's a testimony that you see every color as you turn your head, and what even makes it more enriching is that you're young. It's no longer the elders or somebody that has to have a high-stature age category to stand up for us. We smile upon you because your ancestors are within you. You carry the water and the water has memory. You have their DNA. So when you feel alone, you're not. When you feel weak, you get this awakening of your ancestors in you that says you're not alone. We have survived since the beginning of time and we're gonna continue that survival. So you can keep those future generations whispering their names from years before. We will prevail. Water is life. Man Who Sang For context, we were interviewing someone when two people came over. The woman looked at me and told me that his story needed to be heard. At the Fort Thompson Pow Wow. Fifteen minutes later, he passed away. He died in my brother's arms. I'm so sorry. If he was alive today, he would be here with me right now. Today is his birthday. He's four years old today. Right now, it's kind of a hard time, but I want to do that to honor him. I wanna sing two songs: The one we made, and then one for his birthday. I think that's beautiful, thank you. Right now, it's how I feel. I love my nephews and nieces with all of my heart. I love my family with all my heart. I'm here to fight for them and their future. I want them to have clean water. So if I have to die during the fight, so be it, because I'd die for my nephews and nieces, my grandchildren, and all our future generations ahead. I'd die for them. I'm ready to meet my nephew. Whenever that comes, I'll still be fighting for our future generations. Allison Dew, 18 We found you with the youth council. Yes. Oh my god, they're amazing. It's not just this movement, but they wanna move forward with things after this movement, to help continue to make this place sacred. Not even this specific place, but Planet Earth, Mother Earth. They're working hard to find unity. It's amazing because they're the ones leading these peaceful protecting marches, going up to the front lines, offering the officers blessed and sacred water, just as a gift of kindness. It's really crazy to me, because this group of people are really just trying to change the world, and that's exactly what they're doing. Everyone that we've talked to around the camp, who's older, has given so much praise to the youth council. It's amazing; they lead so much here. It's really insane.

'script', 'twitter-wjs'); Nov 29, 2016 The Dakota Access protesters are about to get a big influx of support from military veterans. Credit: Reuters Michael Wood Jr., a Marine Corps veteran and former Baltimore police officer, is leading a group of 2,000 veterans to North Dakota this weekend to join ongoing protests against the Dakota Access pipeline. Wood, 37, made headlines last year for speaking out in a series of tweets against what he viewed as wrongdoing within his police department. He spoke out after Freddie Gray died from a spinal cord injury after being taken into custody by Baltimore police and is a prominent supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement. The group, Veterans Stand for Standing Rock, had to end the sign-ups after 2,000 veterans signed on. Thousands of protesters, mostly Native Americans, have camped since August just north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation where the largely completed pipeline would cross the Missouri River. The standoff escalated on Nov. 20 when law enforcement used fire hoses, tear gas and stinger grenades on protesters who were trying to clear a roadblock at the end of bridge on a public highway. Last Friday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers notified the Standing Rock tribe that the public will no longer be allowed at the campsite, which is on federal land. On Monday, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple ordered an emergency evacuation of the camp. The Standing Rock tribe said the land is part of their ancestral treaty lands and that they will not leave. Michael Wood Jr.: I think a lot of us are doing this for different reasons. For Wes, he is very focused on ecological protection of the planet. If you are a conservative, you are watching hundreds of millions of dollars being spent on state-sanctioned agents of violence. If you are a libertarian, you care about property rights and freedom. MW: Personally, I want to go across the bridge and take the whole site. But as a whole group, the goal is to bring attention to it, that Native lives need to matter in our systems just like black lives need to matter in our systems. This is that moment in history where there is a change in the tide. MW: If we were to create systems and institutions that protected black lives, then we wouldn't have systems and institutions that allow the oppression of Native American lives that you are seeing right now and throughout our history. MW: It really got to the point where it was just too much. A lot of credit goes to those protesters who are up there now who have created the attention that opened our eyes to understand that we need to get up there. MW: We're not going to be there for three days anymore. We've set up a new roster where we already have 500 people ready to stay there for the next shift. MW: We're not releasing everything that we're doing, we do have some support missions, which we think can make a difference on their own. I want to do it with negotiations. I want to talk to everybody there. That is what we need to do to make sure that we protect our planet, stand up for Native American people, protect black lives, protect native lives and protect the Earth. I will go there personally myself. These cops don't want to do this. If we can't break the system, we can break the hearts and minds of those officers so they realize what they are doing. Hopefully with an entire battalion of people from around the nation who are vets and protecting this country, there is no way around it. There is going to be every race, every religion, every nationality, every geographic region of people that have served this county and stood on that wall. If they are willing to come after us, then that's fine. We'll take that brunt, but that is how you create 10,000 of us next time. MW: You're always going to have some naysayers. They think we were going to be scared, because they don't want to be out there in this cold. We're prepared for it. They're not. MW: No way at all. It's a bluff. I really don't understand why they think that is going to matter. ICN: A recent video shows law enforcement putting up additional razor wire. MW: That's fine. I don't intend to win by force, I intend to win by rational negotiation. MW: We will not use force. They will use force. ICN: You previously said one issue the police are going to face is that your level of planning and coordination is vastly superior to theirs. I don't mean that as an insult. We are going to stay calm. We are going to be disciplined. We are not going to be the one that is going to break across the line. They will. They have been doing it the whole time. There is no reason to believe anything else will be any different.

His exact intentions remain unclear but the US is reportedly considering a military response. The BBC's North America editor says a US strike could be imminent. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said Bashar al-Assad should have no role in a future Syria. His comments signal an apparent U-turn for the US - only last week the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said Washington was no longer prioritising the removal of the Syrian president. Dozens of people, including at least 27 children, are reported to have died following an attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province early on Tuesday. Syria denies its forces were to blame and is supported by its ally, Russia. Military action looks certain: Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor It is a clear and pretty dramatic shift. A month ago, Bashar al-Assad in the eyes of the US was part of the solution, considered useful in the fight against so-called Islamic State. Then yesterday, President Trump said his position had changed, that the Assad regime had crossed many lines. The implication was that there could be military action. But given everything that's been said in the past 24 hours, I would say military action looks certain and could be imminent. We could wake up tomorrow morning and find out the Americans have taken action. Cast your mind back to what President Trump said about Barack Obama, when the then president said a red line had been crossed and he did nothing about it afterwards. He heaped derision on President Obama. If Mr Trump were not to act now, he would look weak and he wouldn't want that. Father grieves for twins killed in Syria UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, asked if he was concerned about possible US military action in Syria, said his priority was to ensure accountability for the deadly gas attack. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Rescue workers said clinics treating the wounded in Khan Sheikhoun were hit by air strikes Evidence has mounted that the victims of the attack in Khan Sheikhoun were killed with a nerve agent such as Sarin. Syria has denied dropping chemical weapons from the air while Russia has argued that the mass poisoning was caused by an air strike on a rebel weapons dump where chemical weapons were being stored. But the claims have been viewed with scepticism from the US and its allies. Syria says it would only accept a UN investigation into the incident if a list of conditions are met.

By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do.

This is a valid concern, but I think impeachment is still important. First of all, you can impeach Pence too. But even if that fails, we might still end up in a better place. Trump is an asset to Pence: someone who can control media attention and be a figurehead for public outcry while he does what he wants. People who do evil things in the most powerful office in the world should be punished for them. Basically, someone in the House needs to call for it, get a few key committees to commission an investigation and then bring the articles of impeachment to the full House floor for a vote. In other words, it involves convincing a lot of Republican Members of Congress to rebel against Trump. Here are a few ways to possibly do it. Find ways to expose his greed, corruption and moral degeneracy, and keep sharing them with the world. Speak out, cause trouble, get press to cover the stories you want covered about him. And most importantly, get him to react to you. There is a point at which his unpopularity becomes such a weight on GOP Members of Congress that they will be willing to kick him over the side of the ship to keep themselves afloat. The more you drive down his ratings, the better. Second, obstruct the things Presidents need to do to pursue their agenda. Being President is hard, and he needs the cooperation of the press, federal agencies and judicial system to make his policies happen. Support lawsuits that obstruct his worst ideas, encourage whistle blowers from the bureaucracy to speak out, and participate in protests that prevent him from getting his message out undiluted. That again makes them likely to jump ship. This is a place where Trump and the House have a difference of opinion. I wanted to add a few things that might be more relevant as the issue of impeachment rockets into the political mainstream. It now appears that the Russia story and ensuing coverup is going to be the most likely avenue for any serious impeachment proceedings. I would like to make the case that impeaching because of the Russia scandal is still a valuable and useful outcome. First, any time you publicly demonstrate that the most powerful person in the world is subject to the rule of law, you are making a step forward for good governance and progressive values. Second, Russia is a right wing, militaristic petro-government that is expanding its influence in the US and abroad for the purpose of extracting more oil and imposing arch-conservative values of patriarchy and militarism.

The Bush family had history in Iraq prior to the 2003 invasion. Claiming thousands of Iraqi troops were threatening Saudi Arabia, and thus U.S. oil interests, Bush Sr. made the case for U.S. military action. Bush ultimately opted not to invade Iraq, instead deploying troops to Kuwait to expel Iraqi soldiers, a move that drew praise from then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. In fact, the CIA provided tactical aid to Hussein knowing he was using chemical weapons. More recently, it was revealed that this relationship was much deeper than previously known. Indeed, the U.S. government empowered Hussein before they moved to oust him under the false pretenses of weapons of mass destruction. Incidentally, Nixon also said this week that he knew immediately upon interrogating Hussein that there were no weapons of mass destruction. Clinton had signed the Iraq Liberation Act by the end of the year, officially adopting a policy of regime change in Iraq and paving the way for the subsequent administration to tear into the country. Nixon has long been a critic of the Iraq War and has revealed many of his experiences in his recent book, Debriefing the President: The Interrogation of Saddam Hussein.

Yes, it's easy to tire of protests in the Trump era, with this rally coming right on the heels of last week's March for Science and not so long after the Women's March. Talk is cheap. But these climate kids deserve your attention. It's hard for legal experts to deny the rights of young people. We are the future. They will be long gone before the long-term effects (of climate change) ever hit them. It's about my kids.

Instead of bemoaning the Orwellian satire that has become the American news cycle, these kids are doing something. They're suing on behalf of the future. Their lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Oregon, initially targeted then-President Barack Obama and his administration. Last year, it survived motions by industry and government to dismiss the case. It has taken on new significance in the first 100 days of Trump's tenure. The President has famously called climate change a hoax, and members of his Cabinet have equivocated on the science, injecting doubt into a long-held scientific consensus that humans are causing the planet to warm by burning fossil fuels and pumping heat-trapping pollution into the atmosphere. The administration's efforts go well beyond rhetoric. Trump ordered a review of the Clean Power Plan, Obama's signature climate legislation. He aims to open federal lands and ocean for fossil fuel extraction. Coal jobs are coming back, he crows. Nevermind that millions of people around the world die each year from diseases linked to air pollution -- much of which comes from coal. A sign is prepared before the march. The administration is reportedly mulling pulling out from the Paris Agreement, an international accord designed to push the planet out of the fossil fuel era. Federal monuments and parks are under review; funding for regulators is on the chopping block. All of this is likely to lead to more pollution and therefore more warming -- more wildfires, longer droughts, rising seas, mass extinction. This is the polluted and dangerous world we are creating, and it's what's chasing activists into the streets. The climate kids could help change the tide. They're arguing on constitutional grounds that their rights to life, liberty and property are being violated by runaway climate change. Their attorneys also say these kids and others are being discriminated against as a class of people. Since they're young, they will live longer into the climate-changed future. They're people like Levi Draheim, who at 9 years old is the youngest child plaintiff. He's a bubbly kid with wild curly hair who lives on the coast of Florida, a place threatened by rising seas. As the Earth warms, the oceans expand and ice melts. Draheim told me he dreams frequently that his home is underwater. Those dreams have only become more frequent since Trump's election, he said. The kids suing Trump and his administration are among thousands expected to gather this weekend in Washington. Draheim isn't old enough to vote, of course. But Saturday's march -- and the court case -- give him and other kids a voice. Julia Olson, an attorney and founder of Our Children's Trust, the nonprofit helping to bring the lawsuit, told me she expects the case to go to trial later this year. Experts in climate law say the suit may be a long shot but remains significant. It only does so when people are willing to press innovative, outside-the-box arguments. Stickers supporting the kids' cause. Olson, the attorney for the kids, said the case is not symbolic and can win. I spent a couple days this week with the climate kids. I heard about their visits to Washington museums and to see the Constitution. I watched as they sang and danced at DC Metro stops, playing Kendrick Lamar simultaneously on two phones to get twice the experience. They explained why they're marching and speaking here even at a moment when they worry adults might not listen. An audience in Washington listens Friday to a presentation by kids suing the Trump administration over climate change. Their hope and generosity are infectious. Their parents and attorneys didn't put them up to this. The kids are genuinely concerned their generation will inherit an irreparably messed-up world. The truth is that we adults need these climate kids. We need them more than thousands of adults marching on Saturday. We need them as a moral compass. And we need them to remind us that our actions will echo for generations to come. I hope not. But if so, they'll be better adults than most. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

While the department does not release details of its operational plans and strategies or confirm the number of law enforcement it has available to respond at any given time, the department does have plans to respond and deal with any potential protest actions that may become unlawful. Protesters have a right to take a position on the pipeline, but they do not have the right to break the law. To introduce rule of law within the camp, we will be asking the Trump administration for much-needed law enforcement support and public safety resources, requests that were ignored by the last administration. Indeed, absent sufficient and balanced coverage from the mainstream media for months, Standing Rock water protectors have relied on platforms like Facebook and Twitter to present an accurate portrait of the quagmire that is the Dakota Access Pipeline project and its opposition. Thousands of supporting water protectors from hundreds of Indigenous bands around the world, as well as non-Native activists, have spent time in a smattering of camps attempting to halt pipeline construction through physical occupation at the site. In fact, claims the pipelines would create much needed jobs hold little basis in reality. It was torpedoed by President Obama in 2015, a month before the Paris Climate Summit. Indeed, simmering contentions between some Standing Rock tribal leadership and other members of the tribe have fomented a near constant anxiety and a flurry of accusations something untoward may be afoot. Tribal council rulings seemed to tacitly confirm those longstanding suspicions over the weekend.

I especially think of this quote after I watch the news to learn of story after story about unarmed black persons killed by cops . I watched the videos of their deaths circulate across social media without a thought of their families or the PTSD that would likely occur from watching one of your loved ones die or be beaten into submission. When I watched those videos I felt physically ill. I thought that despite the psychological pain that the videos caused me, it was my duty to be informed.

Dismissing the pinnedPlayer if another video players plays a video. Kamau Bell explores the causes behind poverty, unemployment and crime among the country's indigenous people. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his. (CNN)In 2017, Sen. Orrin Hatch, in discussing a proposal for a new monument that had been requested by five tribes native to the United States, said something that should have been reported far and wide. It was something so egregious it should have led those close to him to tell him to sit down and take a few deep breaths before speaking again. So let me get this straight. Well unfortunately for you, senator, the word of the US government hasn't historically meant much -- if anything -- to Native Americans. Since its inception, the government has broken and coerced treaties with hundreds of Native American tribes. And this is even worse when you realize that the native peoples of this land are negotiating for land that is by all common sense and elementary school logic their land. Because no matter what Woody Guthrie's famous song says, this land is not your land or my land. That is unless you happen to be a member of one the 562 federally recognized tribes of this land. I can't imagine what it must be like to be one of the indigenous people of the United States of America. I can't imagine watching the news every day -- as people debate whose country this is and who should be in charge of it and how to make it great again -- and hardly ever see your people brought into the discussion. As a black person in this country, I am always frustrated by the lack of attention my people's issues get. But at least the news and politicians are talking about not talking about our issues. Native issues are basically ignored. Dismissing the pinnedPlayer if another video players plays a video. Actor on Native American roles: 'They like us in the 1800s' 01:32 That was overwhelmingly the case until the media began to report on the camps at the Standing Rock Reservation in North and South Dakota. But even most of them got that story wrong. The reports made it seem like it was just a dispute over land. It was, in part. But the bigger story was that the tribes came together to protect the water. And they weren't just protecting their water, they were protecting everyone's -- because that's how water works. The water that runs under Standing Rock is the same water that runs under the ground in cities that aren't on reservations. Tribes from all over -- who have no direct contact with Standing Rock -- showed up to help the people there protect what was already -- and rightfully -- theirs. And they did this for a multitude of reasons. For one, they knew the act of an oil company being allowed by the federal government to lay a pipeline under land that belongs to the Standing Rock tribe without the tribe's permission was a symbol of how the government has historically and consistently treated native peoples. They also knew it wasn't just a battle for land; it was (and is) a battle for millions of non-native Americans, who didn't even know enough to show up and fight alongside of the native peoples. I also spent time at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, one of the poorest places in the country, to get a sense of what day-to-day life is like there These were truly life-changing experiences for me. The unique nature of the action at Standing Rock combined with the honesty, pain and humor of all the conversations -- including one with a mother and father on Pine Ridge whose son had been killed only days before I talked to them -- took my breath away and also somehow inspired me. Dismissing the pinnedPlayer if another video players plays a video. Tepees vs. hotels 00:50 I spoke with activist and former congressional candidate Chase Iron Eyes about how he and his wife made the choice to move their family back to the Standing Rock Reservation, even though they had to downsize and sacrifice many of the big-city comforts to do so. They just felt pulled back home. At Standing Rock, I even ran into my friend, activist and artist Ben Alex Dupris, who gave me a course in Tepee 101. And then he and his friends gave me the gift of an experience I'll never forget. When you watch the show, you will see we were at Standing Rock in 2016 when the camps were at full strength. Acres of land were covered with tents and, yes, tepees. It had the joyful, energized feeling that I think people try to capture at Burning Man and Coachella, but the main difference being no one was appropriating culture here. The headdresses and clothing were all being worn by the people whose ancestors had designed those originally. And also, at Standing Rock, no one was taking a break from their regular life to have fun and see some bands. The various tribes were there on a mission. And let me be clear, they still could use our help in their attempt to help all of us. And not just because of ignorant, condescending and IMHO racist slights by Orrin Hatch. They need our help protecting our water. One of President Barack Obama's last acts was to stop construction of the pipeline. But one of Trump's first acts was to start it back up again. I know small is relative, but do me a favor. Go buy 84 gallons of milk and spill them in your living room and tell me how small that is. And see if no matter how much Febreze you use, you're not smelling fetid cheese for the rest of your lease. And remember, the pipeline is not even fully operational yet, and it's already leaking. I haven't asked the folks I talked to during the episode, but I'm sure none was surprised. After centuries of broken and disrespected treaties, nothing can faze you. And yet hope remains. But don't take it from me. I'm just another non-native whose mom told him we were part-Cherokee. For once, let's listen to them. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

It is time for you to face up to what is taking place in Standing Rock, and to call this off once and for all: deny the easement to the Dakota Access corporation. This all could have been prevented months ago, in April, with your signature. It can be ended now if you will take action today in defense of Native Americans and the environment. In addition to rejecting the easement, police and private contractors who have committed acts of violence must be investigated and charged, and all arrest warrants related to peaceful protest must be dropped. Already, inaction by Democratic leaders underscores why nearly half of America could not bring themselves to vote in the presidential election. The party establishment once again has reaffirmed its loyalty to Corporate America and Big Oil, rather than defending the ordinary people who it claims to represent. Discussions around Thanksgiving dinner tables today may be some of the most tense in decades. Ordinary people must continue to build our movements, in Standing Rock now, and across America in the coming weeks and on inauguration day, to fight back against the bigoted and dangerous policies of the incoming Trump Administration. To be successful, we will need to organize independently of both these big business parties, and look to each other for real hope and change.

Regrettably, the world is replete with experiences we cannot witness firsthand with our senses. But we can begin to structurally analyze the systemic issues that shape our planet. We now exist in a capitalist world that allows entities called corporations to push commodities upon the people for the sake of profit for the few, much like the days of feudalism when the wealthy elite were kings, queens, and aristocrats living in castles, while the poor were relegated to throwing their poop onto the streets. The common people get pushed and pulled into wars and battles mystified by ideologies and narratives that keep people divided or apathetic. Standing Rock, as a pivotal moment, epitomizes the struggle and opens the door for a truer historical understanding, one that recognizes that America was built off of slavery and indigenous land dispossession. As you can see in this essay, I do not intend to zero in on a more particular narrative involving the struggles of the Standing Rock Sioux against the corporate interests of the entity known as DAPL. Instead, I implore those of you reading this short composition to examine the issue, to see the coverage, or lack thereof, of this issue in the mainstream media.

Through my photos, I was able to document the forced removal of the Oceti Sakowin Camp, which I believe was the end of a chapter. I will continue on here for another week and then go back to my family and rest and get ready for whatever is next. I know the opposition to DAPL is not over and people won't stop until the project is dead. They held their ground in a peaceful way, rooted in prayer. Even though the people were forcefully removed from unceded treaty land and they are out of the camp, it's like a turn of a page. A Dine (Navajo) water protector asked his elders back home what they should do about the traditional structures that they built in camp. The elder said that because of the previous behavior by law enforcement disposing of tips and ceremonial items in a disrespectful way in October, the structures should be burned in a ceremony to protect them from disrespect. In order to document them, I first had to have a clear intention on why I wanted to be part of them. A lot of the ceremonies and traditions were illegal until 1978, and because of the the American Indian Freedom of Religion Act, we are able to practice them today. For people at the camp, these ceremonies and songs were the last things they had, so I honored that and made sure my approach was gentle and respectful. At Standing Rock, I became a majority, and that is something I never experienced before. As a journalist, I was able to educate other journalists about the power in these prayer camps.

A lot of times when you go to indigenous communities there are a lot of non-native reporters trying to tell the story of those people. In this movement, you saw native people doing simple things, such as grabbing their phones and starting a livestream; you saw native people taking charge of their narrative; and from that, larger media outlets would contact us for our footage because they never sent their correspondents in the first place. We need more indigenous journalists to document their communities so that we get culturally accurate portrayals of who we really are and not what people think we should be. What I saw at Standing Rock, non-native journalists and filmmakers were really intrigued by the culture, they saw the Native Americans, the tipis, the feathers, the horses, but they were lacking the understanding of who Native Americans are in modern history. They were anthropologists in a way, and it's not fully their fault, it's just the lack of education in the history of our communities. I would encourage people to document their own communities; it makes you more connected to the story. It's a little more accurate and more honorable. I would tell the world that what happened at Standing Rock really is the epicenter of the modern civil rights movement. Before there were protests against Donald Trump, there were prayers here. People got inspired by Standing Rock to eventually continue to stand up to other issues, as all these issues are connected. And it came from a prayer. The second thing is the importance of having proper, consistent coverage from indigenous people on the ground. Before we are journalists, we are human beings. And I think that indigenous journalists understand the importance of approaching the story with intimacy and not just getting the story that is on the surface. We understand how to report from an ethical place, not an extractive place. The more time I spend here on the ground, the more I understand how my work will preserve the story of Standing Rock for future generations. Submit it here.

But perhaps the biggest surprise, even to protest leaders themselves, was the youthfulness of the crowds. A previously apathetic generation of people in their teens and 20s, most of them knowing nothing but 17 years of rule by Vladimir V. Putin, was the most striking face of the demonstrations, the biggest in years. Video The largest protests in several years broke out across Russia over the weekend, and scores were beaten and arrested by the police. That Mr. Navalny has little to no chance of winning, and that he is ineligible to compete because of a February conviction on what were widely viewed as politically motivated fraud charges, is taken for granted. But that may not be the point. The police arrested protesters in some cases for nothing more than carrying a rubber duck, a symbol of extravagant money reportedly spent on a duck pond at a government residence.

In an audio recording posted online that infuriated many young people and drove them to join the protests, a provincial school director can be heard harshly lecturing students before the demonstrations on why they must not attend. In the past, the Kremlin has been highly skillful at channeling the energy of young Russians away from opposition political activism into a pro-Putin youth movement called Nashi and other patriotic ventures. But Aleksei A. Chesnakov, the director of the Center for Current Policy and a former Kremlin official who advised the president on domestic politics, said that in recent years the government had largely withdrawn support for pro-Putin youth movements, leaving the authorities without the ability to stage counterprotests and keep young people occupied.

I linked arms with Loretta Bad Heart Bull, and we teetered up to the central prayer circle with Art Zimiga, an Oglala Hunkpapa Vietnam veteran who had just been gifted a pair of crampons. The sun was still warm, the air scented with burning cedar. The sudden announcement that an easement to cross the Missouri River had been denied by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, dealing the pipeline an apparent setback, sent roars of joy, waves of song, disbelief, joy again, all through the camp. Some wept, sank to their knees, waved wands of smoking sage. Loretta grabbed my arm and tugged me closer to the circle, into the crowd. She is a no-nonsense, funny, sharply dressed woman. Everybody let her through. I crushed up next to Vermae Taylor, from Fort Peck, Mont., who had been back and forth to the camp since August. Mary Lyons, an Ojibwe elder from Leech Lake, beamed and held my arm. She was there for her great-grandchildren. This was supposed to be it, the end of months of desperation. As the pipeline neared, water protectors committed to peaceful action chained themselves to drilling equipment and tried to pray on a butte where Sitting Bull walked.

Native Americans have always maintained an outsize presence in the military, serving on a per-capita basis in higher numbers than any other ethnic group. American Indians fought in the Civil War and World War I before we even had citizenship. Many Native Americans volunteered to serve in World War II and Korea before they were included in the Voting Rights Act, and in Vietnam before the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978. In a country founded on religious freedom, Native Americans were not granted the right to legally practice our own religions until 1978. Since then, indigenous spirituality has become a powerful uniting force. Each tribal nation has its own rituals and observances, but we hold in common the conviction that our earth is a living mystery upon whose tolerance we depend. In the Missouri Breaks, you feel that presence acutely. But the flat aqua expanse of Lake Oahe in view of the Oceti Sakowin camp is another story. Up north, the project displaced the Hidatsa, Mandan and Arikara people. Down here, the Lakota. After so many other acts of dispossession, it was said that many elders died of broken hearts. The Black Snake is what Lakota people call the Dakota Access Pipeline. It will extinguish the world. On Monday, I said goodbye to Loretta, who packed me an egg sandwich. I drove home chased by snow. Along I-94 there were the familiar signs, simple black-and-white admonitions, Be Nice, and Be Polite. It could have been the camp motto. So many young non-Native people have been drawn to this cause. I thought about the spindly girl with wild ringlets, smiling as she served me a plate of wontons and strawberries in the food tent. I worried. After a blizzard, there is usually deep cold. Still, someday, I hope we look back to Standing Rock as the place where we came to our senses. Where new coalitions formed. Where we became powerful together as we realized that we have to preserve land, water, the precious democracy that is our pride, the freedoms that make up our joy. We woke up. We understood that the people who had persevered through everything, including Wounded Knee, knew how easily the world could end. So they were fighting for the water of life, for everyone.

Rep. Tulsi Gabbard from Hawaii, a combat war veteran, will be joining the act of resistance, according to the Facebook page Veterans Stand for Standing Rock. As Task and Purpose notes, federal government ignored their duty under the National Historic Preservation Act to consult the Standing Rock Sioux before approving DAPL. While federal government abandoned Native Americans once again, law enforcement are acting as militarized protection services for Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based company behind the 1,170-mile pipeline. State and local governments are set to reap millions in taxes once the oil begins flowing. The main man behind it all is Wes Clark, Jr., son of Gen. Wesley Clark, a former Supreme Allied Commander who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004. Clark Sr. called for action on climate change, and this motivation is also driving his son to fight against DAPL. Clark and Wood say they are prepared to take a bullet for the cause, and they are going in well-prepared. The veterans will don old military uniforms and be equipped with body armor, ear plugs and gas masks. A packing list virtually mirrors the ones issued to soldiers preparing to deploy to the field (minus the weapons). But there are also parts of the document that read like a revolutionary manifesto. With a group of possibly 500 veterans and other brave souls, they will lock arms and cross the Missouri River to non-violently confront militarized police armed with rifles, mace, batons and dogs. Traditional Sioux war songs will be played as they attempt to peacefully surround the drill pad from which the pipeline will be bored under the river. Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people. We feel that PIVX is this system. PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people. It is the ultimate weapon in the battle against the money changers and information controllers because PIVX is the only cryptocurrency in existence that allows for completely anonymous storage while simultaneously paying interest.

He later said he regretted the remark. But the narrow focus of investigations over the last year is likely to cause further pain in 2018, as the US midterm elections create a new urgency for the problem to be solved. At the beginning of this year, Facebook was hostile to the suggestion that it may have played an unwitting part in a foreign influence campaign. Facebook and Twitter threatened with sanctions in UK 'fake news' inquiry Read more One thing missing from that white paper was the identity of the malicious actor. It later emerged that the company had cut mentions of Russia from the document before publication owing to legal concerns. From there the story snowballed. In October the company shared further information about the ads and how many people had seen them (126 million at the latest count), and it testified alongside Google and Twitter at a hostile committee hearing at the US Congress. Twitter, too, had to reveal some uncomfortable truths. It also had an embarrassing spat with the Russian news organisations Sputnik and RT over whether or not the millions of dollars it took in advertising from the state-owned broadcasters amounted to foreign interference. It eventually donated the cash to fund academic research into elections and civil engagement and banned the organisations from further advertising. Google, for its part, has emerged remarkably clean. As 2017 winds to a close, Facebook could be forgiven for thinking its problems are behind it. But two big concerns still lie ahead, threatening to drag the issue back on to the front pages in the new year. Firstly, the fear of Russian misinformation has gone international, and Facebook is making unforced errors in its response. Circumstantial evidence suggests Russian influence campaigns were far more widespread than just the US, with votes in France, Germany and the UK all affected to a greater or lesser extent. And then there is November. The company has promised changes to its political advertising products to increase transparency, as well as enforcement of rules limiting spending to Americans only.

Next week, the Hamilton man will join with others from Missoula and the Bitterroot who made the same pilgrimage to share their stories and thoughts about the continuing protest in North Dakota. A panel discussion will be held at the Ravalli County Museum from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Jan. 4. When Gras returned to Hamilton from Standing Rock, he heard from a lot of people who wanted to know what he had seen and learned during his two-and-a-half week stay at the makeshift camp. Initially, he thought he would host a small gathering to tell folks about his experiences there. But when he started to spread the word about that idea, he discovered there were a fair number of other people who had gone or were going to Standing Rock to offer their own support to people gathered there. Most recently, Dustin Monroe of Missoula has offered to take part in the panel. An enrolled member of the Assiniboine Tribe of Montana and an Iraq War veteran, Monroe served as the Montana United Indian Association executive director and outreach coordinator for Wounded Warriors Brigade at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington, D.C. Monroe made the 11-hour trip to Standing Rock several times to bring supplies to the thousands protesting the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline. He was also part of the 4,000-strong contingent of military veterans who converged on Standing Rock to support the protesters. Other panel members include Saladin Frank Pelfrey, a Hamilton resident who delivered supplies during one of the recent blizzards and Victor resident Bill Lacroix who brought a truckload of donated supplies to the camp. Panel members will share their experiences of spending time in the camp. Gras expects there may be discussion of the issue of Native American sovereignty and treaty rights. Gras expects that the panel will accept written questions. Stop watching this discussion.

You don't get a bunch of people together and protest the pipeline when one mile is left unfinished. You come to the table when the route is in the planning stages, air your concerns, and take legal action before construction starts, if you feel that your concerns are not met. Suppose I was an organic farmer, and I invested in a tractor, seed, fertilizer, planting equipment, a computer, and software, and was all ready to plant in the spring when some nitwit files a lawsuit saying that I don't have some permit or other just as I'm ready to plant. He knew what I was doing, but waited until the last minute in order to force me to come to unfair terms, or worse, just wanted to bankrupt me. Yes, it is pretty much the same thing. I've seen cultural sites that certainly deserve protection, but it is pretty easy to negotiate them when given enough heads-up. Coming in at the last minute is activism at it's finest. Report Add Reply Bob Schubring Jan 3, 2017 9:20am A genuine water-protector would volunteer to patrol alongside all pipelines, looking for leaks, and arresting anyone who taps into the pipeline to steal the contents. Texas has thousands of miles of pipelines criss-crossing the state. Water is scarce. Oil leaks are a rarity. Nigeria has a few hundred miles of pipelines and oil leaks are common. The difference between Texas and Nigeria, is that there's guerilla warfare in Nigeria, run by gangsters who steal the oil and sell it. This stealing-and-selling business has made the abundant water supplies in the Niger River delta unsafe for humans and livestock. Report Add Reply Welcome to the discussion. Log In Keep it Clean.

Falwell had previously kept a somewhat low political profile, and his endorsement was a sign that Trump might eventually be able to win over conservative Christians. The students, however, were more ambivalent. Last fall, in the weeks before the election, a small group of students wrote a petition urging their fellow Christians to oppose to Trump. When Falwell mentioned Neil Gorsuch, the recently confirmed Supreme Court justice, in his introduction, the crowd cheered wildly. The crowd applauded in agreement. It was like he was back on the campaign trail, once again an outsider railing against the insiders, rather than an elected official who has already won and is now tasked with governing. Trump was relaxed, sitting back with his arms crossed during the pledge of allegiance and opening pomp and circumstance. Trump has come a long way since the last time he visited Liberty. Back in January of 2016, he was still part of a crowded Republican primary field. The media widely mocked him for making a biblical gaffe on the grounds of one of the most conservative Christian institutions in America. Shortly after the 2017 inauguration, Falwell told reporters that Trump had offered him the position of secretary of education, but he declined to accept it. He still seems most at ease out of the White House, among his people, facing adulation and approval rather than policy decisions and a critical press. But unlike those early days of biblical fumbling, Trump has learned how to smoothly connect his anti-establishment message with religious praise. In his first commencement speech as president, he said it was God who brought him to the White House. But in electoral terms, it was people like those at Liberty, and their president is finally speaking their language. We want to hear what you think about this article.

People are winterizing a lot of the structures and tents at Oceti Sakowin, the biggest camp at Standing Rock. I walk to the bridge one last time to snap a few pictures, have a moment of reflection, and perhaps utter something like a prayer, a well-wish, on top of the hill before I depart. One of them is an armored vehicle equipped with a water cannon. Another one is an LRAD, an acoustic sound cannon capable of stunning people at a 162 decibels, which is well above the pain threshold, and would probably cause permanent hearing damage if used at that volume. (Knowing about the LRAD in advance prompted me to take a hearing test the day before I departed for Standing Rock. The relative peace is suddenly broken by a blue semi truck racing toward the barricade. Backwards. At shockingly high speed. A small crew appears. No more than 10 people, and starts connecting some chains to the burned out truck blocking the bridge on the left. A minute later, the semi tries to pull the barricade apart, but the chains break before the barricade even budges. The truck backs up again, and a new attempt is made. Same result, over and over again. By now, the police force (that is staged out of sight over the hills behind the barricades) start rushing in. I believe this is when the first rubber bullets are fired at the small crew and the truck driver. I hear the police on the bullhorn address one of the guys on the bridge by name. A thick curtain of smoke now blocks the view between the police and the small crew, most likely smoke deployed by the crew to make it possible to keep working without getting shot. At 5:30 PM, the semi manages to pull the barricade apart. By 5:45, the semi manages to pull the barricade all the way across the bridge and off to the side of the road. This is when the protectors show up. At first, a slow trickle, by 6:15 a steady parade, growing in numbers by the minute. In hindsight, I now understand this was meticulously planned by the crew working on the bridge, had there been people on the bridge earlier, they could have been crushed by the semi pulling the barricade. Half an hour later, after nearly two hours of tear gas and rubber bullets, the police now begin using the water cannon on the crowd. This is a peaceful, non-violent stance, for clean water, against the DAPL, with our Native Brothers and Sisters. And, everything changes again.The police, without warning, deploy a barrage of tear gas, targeting everyone on the bridge, front to back. They launch tear gas all the way at the end of the bridge. No escape. Screams of panic and pain, the sound of people throwing up and uncontrollably coughing, grows louder, as rubber bullets fire at the crowd in the front. People call out for medics, fall, walk around blinded, in pain. I was planning on leaving hours ago. The plan was to be well on my way back home, to my warm house and sweet family in sunny Los Angeles. I run down to help the people that are hurting. On the bridge, people are vomiting, blinded, wounded, in pain. I try to help as many people as possible. Finding my headlamp in my pocket, I search for people that needed medical attention in a haze of tear gas. Find the person that needs help, and get them to a medic. The medics are amazing. All over the place. Many of the calls for help come from the front, where people are being hit by rubber bullets. It seems to calm down. The police stop firing for a few minutes. Even more people this time. More determined. Stronger. Plastic container lids are being used as shields. Ambulances rush in and out of camp, taking the injured to local hospitals. The rubber bullets keep coming, the water cannon never stops. I go back to taking pictures. I walk around in a daze. Taking pictures. Most of them out of focus and blurred. My senses feel numbed, but at the same time I am hyper-aware. I take a picture of an intimidating looking man on the left side of the bridge. He looks straight at me, walks over to an officer holding a rubber bullet gun, and gives the slightest nod in my direction. I feel it in my gut. They separate, and I watch the officer with the rubber bullet gun, now 10 feet to my right, take direct aim at me. There is no one else around. I duck, run, and find the barrier on the bridge without getting hit. I tell myself to stay calm. I walk, eyes closed, coughing uncontrollably, through a thick cloud of tear gas, when a huge explosion stuns me. A concussion grenade has exploded next to me. Hands grab me and walk me back. I have nothing left. Nothing. I am broken. Done. Six hours. Four of them on the bridge. I do notice a line of blinking lights, and feel upset that someone brought in a light show. I get in my car, hide my memory cards, and drive. Alone. Not only did some brave protectors manage to throw the canisters back, or into the river, they also had to put out all these fires. Sometimes by rolling their bodies over the flames. There was one deliberate fire on the bridge, built to help people warm up, to help the people with hypothermia. There were two fires started on the mud banks, far away from any vegetation. Built for the same reason. We are the water and land protectors. Second: This was a non-violent, peaceful action. We took a beating. We took all of this without retaliating. A few people broke from this a couple of times and reacted to the non-stop violence. They threw plastic water bottles at the police. I can count the amount of times this happened, over all these hours, on my fingers and toes. And every time someone did this, the crowd would check them and stop them. None. Afterword. I told him I was fine. He got mad and said I would get sick from the tear gas exposure and the cold water. He was right. I have a fever, and bronchitis from the exposure. My ears are still ringing. PS. I ran into this water protector at the hotel in Bismarck. About Ravishly Welcome to Ravishly, where we celebrate the mess of being human. We laugh. We cry.

This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline.

The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent. In that way, subsequent actions tend to reinforce and build on each other, leading to the spontaneous emergence of coherent, apparently systematic activity. Stigmergy is a form of self-organization. A personality based system can never allow for mass collaboration on a global scale without representation such as that seen in organizations like the United Nations. If the world is to move away from representation and allow all voices to be heard, we need to find methods of collaboration which work with idea and action based systems. Concentric user groups with epistemic communities and knowledge bridges may work for idea based systems; for action, stigmergy may be the best option. Currently, the typical response to a situation which requires an action is to create a noun, in the form of a committee, commission, organization, corporation, ngo, government body, etc. Far too often, the action never appears at all as the focus is always on the organization and the personalities involved instead. Most systems are now run by competitive organizations. Competition creates redundancy, is slow and wastes resources on idea protection, advertisement, and more. Competition also requires secrecy which blocks progress and auditing and causes lost opportunities and ideas. Patents and copyrights further limit speed and the potential for mass input of ideas. Collaboration between the people with the greatest expertise does not happen unless they are hired by the same project. The alternative to competition has traditionally been cooperation. This is most effective only in groups of two to eight people. For groups larger than 25, cooperation is agonizingly slow, an exercise in personality management which quickly degenerates into endless discussion and soothing of ruffled feathers, is extremely vulnerable to agent provocateurs, and in large scale groups very seldom accomplishes anything of value. Cooperation traditionally operates on the democratic principle that all voices are equal, so it does not allow for leaders, or users with greater expertise, energy or understanding to have greater influence than those on the periphery. Cooperation wastes a great deal of time and resources in both discussing and discussing the discussions. In an action based system, this discussion is rarely required as the opinion of those not doing the work is probably of little value unless it is solicited advice from a trusted knowledgeable party. Cooperation and consensus based systems are usually dominated by extroverted personalities who make decisions to control the work of others and are justly resented by those doing the actual work. Most workers do not enjoy a hierarchical system as shown in the chart below, as they lose autonomy, mastery and creative control over their own work; the feeling at the bottom is no different whether there is a horizontal or a hierarchical structure making the decisions. Cooperative systems frequently use consensus or votes to make decisions for the entire group; these methods may not produce the best results as many people may not understand the work if they are not actually doing it, and they may demand things they would never be willing to do themselves. Hierarchical System Consensus Hierarchy In the Stigmergy chart below, all workers have full autonomy to create as they wish; the power of the user group is in the ability to accept or reject the work. Since there is no officially designated person to perform a task the users are free to create alternatives if they do not like what they are offered. Workers are free to create regardless of acceptance or rejection; in the chart below some work may be accepted by the largest group, some alternatives for a different user group, some only by a small group, and sometimes the worker will be alone with their vision. In all cases the worker is still free to create as they wish. History has shown no drastically innovative ideas that received instant mainstream acceptance and history also shows that radically new ideas are most often the result of solitary vision; to leave control of work to group consensus only is to cripple innovation. Stigmergy In a competitive environment, a new idea is jealously guarded, legally protected and shrouded in secrecy. Great effort is expended in finding supporters for the idea while also ensuring that the idea remains covered by legal protections such as non-disclosure agreements. The idea remains inextricably bound to the creator until it is legally transferred to another owner and all contributors work for the owner, not the idea. Contributors must then be rewarded by the owner which further limits the potential for development and wastes more resources in legal agreements, lawsuits, etc. Contributors have no interest in whether the project succeeds or fails and no motivation to contribute more than they are rewarded for. If the idea is instead developed cooperatively, it must first be pitched by the originator, who will attempt to persuade a group to adopt the idea. The group must be in agreement with the idea itself and with every stage of its development. The majority of energy and resources are spent on communication, persuasion, and personality management, and the working environment is fraught with arguments and power struggles. Because the project is driven by a group, albeit a cooperative one, the group is still competitive with other similar outside projects, and still wastes resources and energy on secrecy, competitive evangelizing, etc. Both competitive and cooperative projects will die if the group that runs the project leaves and both will attract or repel contributors based on the personalities of the existing group. Both are hierarchical systems where individuals need to seek permission to contribute. Both focus on the authority of personalities to approve a decision instead of focusing on the idea or action itself. Stigmergy is neither competitive nor traditionally collaborative. With stigmergy, an initial idea is freely given, and the project is driven by the idea, not by a personality or group of personalities. No individual needs permission (competitive) or consensus (cooperative) to propose an idea or initiate a project. There is no need to discuss or vote on the idea, if an idea is exciting or necessary it will attract interest. The interest attracted will be from people actively involved in the system and willing to put effort into carrying the project further, not empty votes from people with little interest or involvement. Since the project is supported or rejected based on contributed effort, not empty votes, input from people with more commitment to the idea will have greater weight. Stigmergy also puts individuals in control over their own work, they do not need group permission to tell them what system to work on or what part to contribute. The person with the initial idea may or may not carry the task further. Evangelizing the idea is voluntary, by a group that is excited by the idea; they may or may not be the ones to carry it out. It is unnecessary to seek start up funding and supporters; if an idea is good it will receive the support required. (In practice, that is not true yet, as few people have the free time to put into volunteer projects because most are tied to compulsory work under the existing financial system. Secrecy and competition is unnecessary because once an idea is given, it and all new development belongs to anyone who chooses to work on it. Anyone can submit work for approval, the idea cannot die or be put on hold by personalities; acceptance or rejection is for the work contributed, not the person contributing it. All ideas are accepted or rejected based on the needs of the system. Responsibility and rights for the system rest with the entire user group, not just the creators. There is no need for people to leave the system based on personality conflicts as there is no need for communication outside of task completion and there are usually plenty of jobs with complete autonomy. As no one owns the system, there is no need for a competing group to be started to change ownership to a different group. Stigmergy provides little scope for agent provocateurs as only the needs of the system are considered. Because the system is owned by all, there is also no one leader to target. Nodes As work progresses and core team and members grow, more interested and dedicated personalities emerge which begin to steer direction. As more members are added, more will experience frustration at limited usefulness or autonomy. Some of these members will have an interest in the work left undone and they will create a new node of like minded members and new people to take care of the undone work. Alternatively, casual users and observers of the system, who lack the desire or expertise to be a more active part of the original system, will see a different need created and start a new node. Rather than the traditional corporate model of endless acquisition and expansion, stigmergy encourages splintering into different nodes. Because each individual is responsible only for their own work, and no one can direct a group of workers, expansion means more work for the individual, a self limiting prospect. As a system grows, the additional work requires either additional resources or splintering; as communication is easier and there is more autonomy in smaller groups, splintering is the more likely outcome of growth. Communication between nodes of a system is on an as needed basis. Transparency allows information to travel freely between the various nodes, but a formal relationship or communication method is neither necessary nor desirable. Information sharing is driven by the information, not personal relationships. If data is relevant to several nodes it will be immediately transmitted to all, no formal meetings between official personalities are necessary. Any node can disappear without affecting the network, and the remaining necessary functionality of that node can be taken up by others. Nodes which find they are performing the same tasks will likely join, or one will be rendered obsolete by lack of use. New nodes are only created to fulfill a new need or provide greater functionality; it is inefficient to have the same task performed twice, and that only occurs if a second group discovers an alternative method that the first group is unwilling to adopt. In that case, the best system will win the most support from the user group, the other will die or remain as a valued alternative. Any user can contribute to the node which best matches their interests and abilities, or contribute to multiple nodes. The future A new system of governance or collaboration that does not follow a competitive hierarchical model will need to employ stigmergy in most of its action based systems. It is neither reasonable nor desirable for individual thought and action to be subjugated to group consensus in matters which do not affect the group, and it is frankly impossible to accomplish complex tasks if every decision must be presented for approval; that is the biggest weakness of the hierarchical model. The incredible success of so many internet projects are the result of stigmergy, not cooperation, and it is stigmergy that will help us build quickly, efficiently and produce results far better than any of us can foresee at the outset.

At that time, not many were there, but it was enough to create a prayer to wake up the people. I told the young people that Standing Rock is everywhere. Later that month, our indigenous youth set out on foot to run from the Standing Rock Reservation to Washington D.C. in an attempt to bring attention to the poisonous bitumen oil pipeline coming through our treaty territory. For our young people, it was important to explain to U.S. government leaders that this was unacceptable. As I look back at my experiences at Standing Rock, I think about the circle we created through prayer on December 4, 2016. Our traditional Elders asked all nations to join us and stand in prayer. Thousands, including many religious representatives, joined in prayer on that very cold day. An invitation video was made and sent all over the world.

As Keeper to the White Buffalo Calf Woman Bundle, I have also brought attention to the white animals being born, signaling us of changes globally.

In our tradition, we pray for everything we eat and drink so our minds can be good. When the environment that we live in is sick and suffering, so too are the minds and decisions of our leaders.

Over-militarized police officers began the offensive Sunday evening after water protectors attempted to clear burned-out military vehicles from the roadway that had been blocked since a clash on October 27. Standing Rock Sioux water protectors have been concerned the blockade was obstructing access by emergency services to the reservation and area residences. Completely blocked from escape by the violent police attack on one side, the 400 water protectors were forced to endure the hours-long offensive rather than trampling over each other trying to escape. It was sometime during this chaos Wilansky suffered the horrific trauma, and scores of water protectors were left with serious wounds, including many who experienced hypothermia from the life-endangering police use of water cannons.

Berkeley psychologists Paul Piff and Dacher Keltner ran several studies looking at whether social class (as measured by wealth, occupational prestige, and education) influences how much we care about the feelings of others. In one study, Piff and his colleagues discreetly observed the behavior of drivers at a busy four-way intersection. They found that luxury car drivers were more likely to cut off other motorists instead of waiting for their turn at the intersection. This was true for both men and women upper-class drivers, regardless of the time of day or the amount of traffic at the intersection. In a different study they found that luxury car drivers were also more likely to speed past a pedestrian trying to use a crosswalk, even after making eye contact with the pedestrian. The researchers asked participants to spend a few minutes comparing themselves either to people better off or worse off than themselves financially. Afterwards, participants were shown a jar of candy and told that they could take home as much as they wanted. They were also told that the leftover candy would be given to children in a nearby laboratory. Those participants who had spent time thinking about how much better off they were compared to others ended up taking significantly more candy for themselves--leaving less behind for the children. A related set of studies published by Keltner and his colleagues last year looked at how social class influences feelings of compassion towards people who are suffering. In one study, they found that less affluent individuals are more likely to report feeling compassion towards others on a regular basis. This was true even after controlling for other factors that we know affect compassionate feelings, such as gender, ethnicity, and spiritual beliefs. In a second study, participants were asked to watch two videos while having their heart rate monitored. One video showed somebody explaining how to build a patio. The other showed children who were suffering from cancer. After watching the videos, participants indicated how much compassion they felt while watching either video. The results of the study showed that participants on the lower end of the spectrum, with less income and education, were more likely to report feeling compassion while watching the video of the cancer patients. These findings build upon previous research showing how upper class individuals are worse at recognizing the emotions of others and less likely to pay attention to people they are interacting with (e.g. by checking their cell phones or doodling). After all, it seems more likely that having few resources would lead to selfishness. Piff and his colleagues suspect that the answer may have something to do with how wealth and abundance give us a sense of freedom and independence from others. The less we have to rely on others, the less we may care about their feelings. This leads us towards being more self-focused. Another reason has to do with our attitudes towards greed. Piff and his colleagues found that wealthier people are more likely to agree with statements that greed is justified, beneficial, and morally defensible. Given the growing income inequality in the United States, the relationship between wealth and compassion has important implications. Those who hold most of the power in this country, political and otherwise, tend to come from privileged backgrounds. If social class influences how much we care about others, then the most powerful among us may be the least likely to make decisions that help the needy and the poor. They may also be the most likely to engage in unethical behavior. Keltner and Piff recently speculated in the New York Times about how their research helps explain why Goldman Sachs and other high-powered financial corporations are breeding grounds for greedy behavior. Although greed is a universal human emotion, it may have the strongest pull over those of who already have the most.

It has become far too easy for these companies to manipulate the deportation system as a weapon against their employees, threatening retaliatory deportation of immigrant workers who try to organize or speak out about wages and working conditions. Bad employers send a powerful, chilling message in the workplace when they deport employees for speaking out. The result is that too many workers are treated as second class and are too susceptible to abuse. The fear of deportation is real. Recently, a group of workers employed on a public workers project in the Washington, DC area came together and organized to protest reported wage theft by their employer, only to have their immigration status used in retaliation against them. As a result, more than half of the workers were fired and many workers and their family members were placed in deportation proceedings. By driving down labor standards to the lowest common denominator, they make it harder to enforce laws and standards even for native-born workers, and harder for employers who play by the rules to remain competitive. Not surprisingly, most Americans are against the deportation of workplace whistleblowers. Communities and commonsense policymakers have had enough of the deportations. signed the TRUST Act into law last weekend, a bill that gives law enforcement much more leeway to respond to immigration detainer requests and sets a minimum standard to ensure that those with most low-level, non-violent offenses are not wastefully held for deportation purposes. All month, immigration advocates have held vigils, concerts, forums, and protests demanding Congressional action. This weekend, thousands more are planning a massive civil disobedience in Arizona aimed at shutting down Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the day. When immigrant workers have rights and everyone competes on a level playing field, workers across the board do better. We need to stand up for immigrants who work in unsafe, abusive jobs with the constant threat of deportation hanging over them. By doing so, we stand up for the rights of all workers.

Patheos has the views of the prevalent religions and spiritualities of the world. So I read on to find out about the Dakota Access Pipe Line. I could have stopped there and scoffed at the futility of all of that, but I immediately saw this as a much bigger and more important conflict than anyone had yet recognized in writing. This was a 3.8 BILLION dollar project. Worse, this pipeline is being funded by the entire list of corporations said to be the oligarchy which now controls the United States, including Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, and several other financial institutions. Trump has a million dollars of his own money in this too. This was much bigger than any of those things: because if this story got out, it would be the moment when Americans would see that a corporatocracy really does exist: that it is gonna do whatever it wants, and that it no longer matters what We The People have to say about that. Because we are no longer a Democratic Republic. A couple of Ivy League studies had already announced that earlier this year. But this is the clearest illustration of that fact. I thought that what was happening at Standing Rock might be the spark of an actual revolution: not the type of peaceful progressive political revolution that Bernie wanted, but a real one, a revolution in the more traditional sense. Anyone can shoot down or ridicule any attempted solution to any problem, but I want to talk to the people who are not only finding solutions but enacting them: who are taking action and actually doing something to fix things and make it better. That is what what the Sioux are doing, and their story needed to get out. By that time, there were few people who were even aware that this was really even happening. In fact the Morton County Sheriffs Department had reportedly arrested over a hundred journalists, trying to keep a lid on this. So right away I tried to contact someone associated with this stand-off -to see if I could get their story out in my own way. I found some contacts with the Cheyenne River Reservation pretty quickly, but try as I might, I could not arrange to have any number of people join me in a Google Hangout. I was told that living on a reservation is like living in a third world country. The few people willing to talk to me seemed limited only to their phones. At one point, I thought I could get a couple different people together in one place for a podcast, but it seemed that not that many people had a reliable internet connection. No one wanted to talk to an atheist activist either. I spoke with a few different people but could not get anyone to agree to a podcast. They wanted mainstream media. But it seems that CNN did NOT want to talk about anyone opposed to anything financed by Goldman Sachs. Finally I was told that if I want to interview anybody up there, I would have to go there myself. My wife and I were keen to do just that, but there was another delay. I had already scheduled a 7,000 mile road-trip book-tour of 18 cities in seven states over five weeks. Once I got back from that, Democracy Now had finally broken the story, and The Young Turks and Redacted Tonight were talking about it too. I even found some slightly-spun mentions of it on one or two mainstream sources. By the way, Mark Ruffalo, who played the Hulk -showed up to donate solar panel trailers to provide these people some power. I take that as evidence that Marvel is better than DC. Myself, Anas Siddique, and Tracy Savage at Standing Rock Even before I returned from my book tour, we had already arranged another 3,000 mile road trip. Tracy Savage, co-founder of The Secular Latino Alliance flew in from San Diego and we drove from Dallas to Omaha Nebraska. There we picked up Anas Siddique, a student of Journalism who had flown in from Toronto. He brought professional cameras with him. Savage actually knew several of the people involved with Standing Rock. Without her, no one would have spoken to me or Siddique. Along the way we heard news that there was some military involvement now, and that the police had raided one of the camps. Children were reportedly being evacuated from one area because of rubber bullets in the air and snipers on the hill. One 16 year-old was shot in the lung and had to endure a very long ride to the nearest hospital, some thirty or so miles away in Bismark. People were forcibly removed from teepees which were then damaged, and this was just another day of escalating brutality against peaceful assembly. It took another whole day to drive from Omaha Nebraska to Eagle Butte South Dakota where we met our contacts in a room suitable for recording. But there were other problems. I was just recovering from a week-long run of laryngitis, and my beloved Canon Vixia HF M31 was crapping out on me. Used to be, I could record four hours straight from its hard drive. But now it was limited to the thirty minute capacity of its SD card. He had to keep resetting them every half hour or so. Somehow the data from one of the cameras was subsequently lost altogether. So we did what we could with what we had. Tracy arranged for us to meet with her friend, Terri Hulm, who was connected to everyone and everything going on at Standing Rock: same with Jim Barbosa, a Cheyenne River tribal leader. We were fortunate to be joined by Cody Hall. He is one of the most central characters in this stand-off. He also personally escorted Green Party presidential candidate, Jill Stein, and journalist Amy Goodman from Democracy Now, all of whom subsequently had warrants issued for their arrest. After this interview, we drove several more hours to a hotel in Bismark, North Dakota. There we re-charged. Just a few hours later, we headed out to the main camp of Oceti Sakowin. This was November 3rd. There were unexpected road blocks, occupied both by state police and some branch of US military. I was surprised at one point to see nine semi trucks coming the other way. Of course they were all carrying pipe. They were supposed to have stopped working, having no valid permits at that time. We crossed the pipeline route three or four times before we found ourselves on a normal road again. We came to another police blockade, but this one was letting people through. I guess there was no way they could legally stop everyone by that point. Remember that the reason we were there was to get the story out. But on that particular day, there was a ban against all new journalists. That never made sense, and I know that some of the organizers were outraged over that. Savage and Saddique said they were going to try to get clearance to interview people anyway. So expecting that there would be another organized action later on, I took a class in how to get arrested. We were cautioned that we should have eye protection since they were using tear gas now, and ear plugs because they were also using sound canons. One of the camps was cleared using concussion grenades too. We had no provision against that. I was also warned not to go to the front with my wallet or any personal items, as I would not get them back if I were arrested. No one was getting IDs or personal items returned. I had already heard about the trucks spreading some sort of liquid in the grass nearby, where a fire just happened to erupt the next day. But the wind carried it the wrong way, so that an airplane had to come by and put it out. While I was there, all I saw was one aircraft circling continuously hour after hour over head. But sadly none of us could stay. That night we learned that a hundred or so collective clergymen of different religious denominations had been bussed to the capital to plead their case with the governor -only to be arrested. They put the capital building on a security lock-down. They want so much to pretend that this is a riot. The next day we got the news that helicopters with spotlights kept lighting up the camp all night long to keep everyone awake. Then we heard that cops were stopping cars, not to take their camera and such -which they had often done before. I understand that this pipeline is NOT safe. This pipeline must not go through. More than that, we HAVE to get away from fossil fuels -especially from fracking, which is the source of this oil. Everything is wrong with this situation, and it must be stopped. While we were still on the road back home, we heard that the Army Corps of Engineers demanded again that construction halt for at least six weeks; that a legal team was being assembled to fight for the water protectors in court, and that Erin Brockovich was among them. That seems appropriate as exposing polluted water was how she got famous. Then Barack Obama said that the pipeline should be re-routed. So it looked like there was finally a ray of hope. But of course construction continued regardless, and then Trump won the election. Since then, one woman had her arm blown apart by a police grenade and another was blinded by a rubber bullet. Dozens have been drenched by a water cannon at temperatures well below freezing, and then someone reported crop dusters started dropping unknown chemicals on the campsite at night. The only good news was that hundreds of veteran service men would soon arrive as much-needed reinforcements against the corporation state. This stand-off is a powder-keg situation, and it has already exposed -to the whole world just how corrupt our government, the corporate oligarchy of these now deeply-divided states has become. Another wave of hate was indeed unleashed. A Humanist Lesson On Matthew Turner Humanists, meet a predecessor.

I've been in Fargo and I've been through Bismark and I've seen Native American poverty from my car window. The shale oil and gas boom was still two decades away. Two months ago I shipped a carton of winter coats and clothing to the Standing Rock encampment, where thousands of people are now protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the serious threats it poses to water and environmental safety and to indigenous peoples' culture and autonomy. I have friends and acquaintances who have done a lot more than ship clothing to North Dakota. This pipeline is slated to carry Bakken Crude Shale Oil, fracked in North Dakota, beneath 200 different waterways to a refinery in Chicago.

I have come to understand that they are fighting for all of us. They are first and foremost protecting the Earth and are on the frontline against global warming, willing to risk their lives. It would be fully consistent with American history for some Native leaders to be murdered in these actions. Every day at the camp there is two-hour non-violent training session. On a day that I attended there were over 50 people, mostly new arrivals from the Comanche Nation in Oklahoma. It was repeatedly stressed that this is non-violent, peaceful action and that is under the rubric of Ceremony. There are about 40 teepees and hundreds of tents at Standing Rock, housing about 1500 people. Over 300 Native Nations have sent representatives at different times in this unprecedented show of unity.

Here's an interview with her father, Wayne Wilansky, who followed up on November 23rd with a call to President Obama to halt the pipeline's construction. And Bernie Sanders, an early supporter of the protests, has called on Obama to turn the site into a protected federal monument. So those are the three issues there. I think what we have done is, number one, demanded that the president do what he did with Keystone. A lot of people put a lot of pressure on the president, and he finally did the right thing. And that is to kill the Keystone pipeline, which, by the way, under a Trump may be reopened again. But that is what he should be doing. And certainly, the demand must go to the North Dakota authorities that the kind of military presence that exists there is simply not what is acceptable. So, we have written to the president. We are going to continue to put pressure on the president to do everything he can to protect the Native Americans in the area and the protesters in the area.

There were strict house rules about everything from how to hang our towels to how to wash the cutlery; we were chastised harshly when we got it wrong. The groups were all doing important work on a range of issues, but the meetings themselves were strained. For her part, Marta seemed largely uninterested in what we did back home, if a touch repelled by the entitlement and indulgences inherent in being an American artist at all. Her region still had one of the highest murder rates in the Americas. Multinational corporations were plundering the country and the world. There was real work to be done. It was the beginning of my sense that art and activism were two divergent paths, though since then, the state of the world has continually compelled me to try to reconcile them. Occupy Wall Street happened while I was getting my MFA in fiction, and I spent a good deal of time at Zuccotti while being careful not to join anything. Then came the 2014 assault on Gaza. Working it out in writing was not an option; I already felt desperately alone. But more often, the task of trying to graft my creative practice and concerns onto movement work has felt isolated and ill-fitting. Fair enough: these are effective and necessary tactics, and ones that activists are uniquely qualified to carry out. But even direct action itself, with its aspiration to spectacle, its myriad opportunities for performance and design and creative direction, is too often carried out artlessly, the imaginative potentialities reduced to the plane of a sloganed banner. I asked them. The rest of us, I argued, need something more nourishing, more beautiful. We copied it onto butcher paper in orange Sharpie and hung it at the front of the room. Our collaborative workshops were some of our least successful activities, exposing the difficulty in facilitating collective creation processes in groups brought together foremost by politics as opposed to aesthetics. like finding a suitable role for artists in a movement led by activists was a classic case of square peg, round hole. They are prostrate to higher values, motivated by desire for impact. And until we manage to bring the revolution, the volunteer nature of so much movement work will continue to exploit artists, an already notoriously underpaid group. But there are deeper incompatibilities. In their mandate to be awake to life, and to awaken others, the sympathies of artists and activists seemingly align. Activism wants unity, it wants simple slogans and decisive rhetoric. Art wants things grayer, messier, and on personal terms. Activism demands allegiance. Art knows no allegiances save those of practice and form. Artists think activists are myopic, and distrust them because orthodoxy is ugly and boring. Activism expects art to explain itself, to proffer a reason for being. Though these two belief systems are not always at odds, they are simply not the same thing. Angels in America, which debuted near the height of the AIDS crisis and talks politics endlessly, is definitively art. The majority of this work is as eminently forgettable as it is common. But we can identify some instructive examples. And there are also those exceedingly rare works that seem equally successful at both, often by using their form to bear a unique kind of witness, helping us digest enormous horror at the scale of the individual. Perhaps. I take for granted that our current struggles need every one of us, giving what we can, and that artists, who know how to attract people, how to leach their message into a culture, how to bring people into contact with life, have a special role to play. This makes me want to build a fence around my sacred practice, to serve no one but the one true God, the God of Art, forever and ever, amen. Suddenly anything felt possible, if only in the most alarming sense. In this awful state of unknowing, the idea of spending my time futzing around with sentences, with the lives of made up people, seemed utterly deranged. I was not alone. And yet, as Hane alludes to in his essay, the gripping experience of creating or enjoying art is one of our greatest weapons against the concession of our inner lives. I am tempted once again to resign my post in shame. Fuck art, I think. Give me bodies on the line. And yet, what a way for the lesson to reach us. Written only after the means of production have been destroyed. Remember, Roosevelt turned away the asylum-seekers on the St. Louis, sending hundreds to their deaths. Camus wrote The Stranger from 1940s occupied Paris, nary a Nazi in its pages. And for those of us who still feel the pull to a more direct form of activism, perhaps there is an opportunity, not to organize with the activists, but to organize ourselves as artists, to form our own revolutionary groups in the tradition and spirit of the Situationists, taking as a starting point our tools and tactics, building around our mandates and strengths. And we can serve them better, too, in a manner that does not depend on our self-negation or even selflessness, but on our talent for transcending time and shifting ground, for remaking the future in our image. These vignettes came out of a particular set of interviews in Miami Beach, then a great if already fading community for the Jewish Old Left (Jewish Currents founder-editor Morris Schappes provided inspiration and contacts). I loved these old-timers, and they seemed very attached to me: I wanted to hear about their lives. I hardly knew my own (gentile) grandparents, and I was happy to be adopted, even for a short while. Those closest to Jewish Currents were, from my recollection, the most clear-eyed about the past. They regretted the illusions they had had about Russia, but they considered themselves fortunate to have been in so many good struggles, and to have kept many of the same friends they had known since their first years in America. We had a needles trade union of our own. and it was Red. But we had to go back to the ILG with our heads down. People are old and sick and dying. But our paper gives us something to live for. If we are the last Yiddish socialist generation We will carry on until the end. Someone called her a Pepper Pot of a Woman. Sasha Zimmerman, his boss Dubinsky was against us but his door was always open to me. We settled problems right away. The bosses got away with nothing. He was very progressive but quiet. He gave a lot of money to the movement. Down here, we had events for everything that the movement needed. When he died, a blonde pianist and Yiddish music scholar Pursued me, sang to me in concerts Even while his wife was dying at home. But when she died, he married me. And we published his music books. The young people, they sit out at night in the cafes, some have guitars and they sing. Boyfriends and girlfriends just like anywhere else. Just ordinary. And before my friends would arrive. We wanted a place to be close to each other And carry on our politics and culture. We had wonderful times. We always supported progressives and opposed the wars. Now we are all dying. The young people are Cuban, and they hate us. TRANSGENDER BODIES are often stripped of our spirituality and mysticism. I struggled to articulate why the ritual felt as necessary as the anesthesia or scalpel. She explained that we keep mezuzot on our doorposts to mark the transition from one space to another, physically and spiritually. Articulating the transition, the before and after, is crucial to building the ritual. We both knew the traditional trans narrative: trans person is sad, trans person has a dangerous and tumultuous coming out, trans person has surgery, trans person is finally worthy of love and acceptance. Trans person is palatable; trans person is less likely to die at the end of the film. Trans Jew goes to the mikveh to mark the transition from incomplete to complete. I hope those people are doing well. I hope we both survive to the end of the film. I periodically get side-eyed in either bathroom. My hair is long and thick and curly and out of control, not shorn in that cute, tight butch cut all my transmasculine friends have. I would have to take my makeup off before stepping into the mikveh. I was not going from the bad kind of trans to the good kind of trans. It said my body had always been good enough for kindness, and that this impending change, this shift in shape, was not because I was a broken, bent gear in need of sanding down. stayed with me for weeks before I found an answer. I was not marking the linear transition from one gender to another. I was not marking the transition from the wrong kind to the right kind of trans. I was marking my transition through Jewish time, and my right to stay within it. The mikveh created space to embrace the transition I was already experiencing; it held my trans body in a way that both the medical industrial complex and the secular world refuse to. I sobbed through most of the ritual. I had to really work to get the Hebrew of the prayers past my lips. Min hameitzar karati Yah, anani vamerchav Yah. Out of a narrow place, I called to God. We sang the shehecheyanu and every part of my body touched the water. The power of being within that moment, singing holy words that recognize the beauty and magnitude of change, has not left me. It continues to compel me to stay within Jewish spaces, and to demand that my trans-ness is non-negotiable. Our Jewish and queer seminal stories are ones of crossing over: survival and transformation in the face of despair and decimation. There is no way to unwind the braided existence of my gender deviance and my Jewishness. I went to the mikveh because I was called, by my ancestors and by a future where trans Jews define our own lives, bodies, and ritual practices. Jayce Koester is a friendly trans Jewish witch living on occupied Dakota and Anishinaabe land (often called Minneapolis). FOR PROGRESSIVES ABROAD, it might seem like all news coming from Israel is bad news. But recent developments in the struggle against the deportation of African asylum seekers prove just how much power there is in coalition building, demonstrating how our demands are more than a zero-sum game. Netanyahu likely expected to defeat this opposition handily. Most asylum seekers live in the poor and marginalized neighborhoods of South Tel Aviv. Infrastructure and housing have crumbled. Drug use, prostitution, and human trafficking are rampant. The right wing has found its ultimate scapegoat in these vulnerable asylum seekers. For years, the Israeli right wing has promoted a simple equation: the interests of the African asylum seekers are in direct contradiction to those of the disenfranchised Mizrahi residents of the South Tel Aviv slums. This right-wing dichotomy was effective at first because it contained a kernel of truth. There is, and has long been, a connection between liberal political positions and economic status and ethnic background in Israel. Using this history, the right branded all defenders of the refugees as elitists, as haters of the Jewish poor. Not so differently from the politics of Trump and his allies, the right-wing political establishment and its tycoon buddies thus paradoxically portrayed themselves as standing with the lower classes while doing little to nothing to alleviate their conditions. Their message was simple but revolutionary: the right wing takes advantage of the plight of South Tel Aviv as an excuse to deport the refugees. As the government makes plans to deport the asylum seekers, these activists argued, they are already deporting the long-time residents of these neighborhoods; it is deportation through gentrification and the unchecked power of real estate agents who buy crumbling apartment buildings and tear them down to build luxury housing. Our activists, some of whom are themselves based in South Tel Aviv, supported the initiative as it was making its first steps. Assessing strategically, we supported a coalition that would include both the underprivileged residents of South Tel Aviv and the African asylum seekers, as well as allies from all over the country. Throwing ourselves into the struggle, we convened large, simultaneous volunteer meetings in several cities. These veteran and newly-recruited activists were organized into a network of small teams with clear goals. Standing Together was able to play an important role in this struggle for two main reasons. First, because we are not a traditional NGO: Standing Together is a grassroots movement that draws its strength from the energy and activism of its members. This is essential for any progressive campaign serious about winning. Secondly, we took a broad-sighted view of progressive politics, and insisted that economic and racial struggles cannot remain separated. For us, the plight of the poor, socially excluded Jewish residents of South Tel Aviv was on equal footing with that of the African asylum seekers. The electoral behavior of these poor Jewish communities sometimes positions them as the base of the right wing (analogous, perhaps, to the white working-class Americans who voted for Donald Trump). But this doesn't need to be the case. When we show these groups respect, rather than treating them as ignorant reactionaries, coalitions and wins are possible. Almost overnight, the public sphere of these neighborhoods changed. But walking in the street in South Tel Aviv, with balcony after balcony bearing these banners, anyone could see that behind every window and every home lived a person or family who supported the rights of both Israeli residents and asylum seekers. There we knocked on doors, canvassed in the streets, and got numerous people to publicly express their willingness to have asylum seekers live in their part of town, calling for the Tel Aviv municipality to allocate greater municipal funds to the urgent problems of the southern neighborhoods. Throughout this campaign, we consistently emphasized the responsibility of the government. Together we rewrote the dichotomy on which the right had so long depended. We made clear that the true elitists were those in the highest ranks of power, who scapegoated the refugees as a smokescreen for making private profit off of South Tel Aviv. At no time was this clearer than on February 24th, when 20,000 asylum seekers, South Tel Avivians, and activists from across the country demonstrated together. In previous years, pro-refugee demonstrations were organized by human rights NGOs and held in the manicured central squares of affluent Tel Aviv, the stage often dominated by line-ups of artists, celebrity intellectuals and liberal politicians. But this rally was different. Taking center stage were older Mizrahi women, long-time residents of these neighborhoods who spoke about their lives, the suffering their families and friends face due to government disregard for their living conditions, and about the realities of living alongside other poor people of African origin. Previous pro-refugee rallies were met with swift condemnation from Likud politicians. But this time, they were silent. On April 2nd, Netanyahu convened a press conference wherein he announced that an agreement had been reached with the UN. Half of the refugees would be granted asylum in Europe and North America, and the other half would remain in Israel, with permission to work and live in various cities throughout the country. Furthermore, he announced that specific budgets would be allocated to South Tel Aviv. Our victory celebrations were cut short when pressure from the right caused Netanyahu to announce the very next day his cancellation of the new agreement with the UN. Nevertheless, the plan to forcefully deport tens of thousands of asylum seekers has not reappeared. Clearly there is more fight ahead, but the lesson learned is one coming to organizations in Israel, America, and beyond. I met Keith Gessen in 2015 when he was a Fellow at the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library. He was researching his second novel, which was then simply called Russia. The novel, which unfolds with unexpected humor, is about intimate relationships, familial and social, and the tests they are subjected to under different state regimes. It is also about the ease with which one can enter and leave certain ways of life, and who is free to make those choices. When I first wrote to you and told you how she made me think of my own, you said I was not the first person to tell you this. Keith Gessen: The book was always going to be about a guy who goes to Moscow to take care of his grandmother. Everything else was negotiable. But the role of the grandmother changed over time. I was very wary of turning her into a magic grandmother, the bearer of some occult knowledge or secret. A friend who I show my work to kept half-seriously suggesting that she should have stashed away some secret manuscript, for example about the Holocaust, which Andrei would find and then bring to the attention of the world. The book would be called The Holocaust Diary. Guaranteed best-seller. The breakthrough was when I realized that the grandmother and the socialism were actually part of the same story. It was a kind of gradual process of throwing out all the stuff that was boring or not part of the story: a long summary of Chapter 7 of Capital or a capsule biography of Marx. I was definitely trying to describe a very specific grandmother. One of the interesting things to me, actually, watching the recent resurgence of socialism in the US, has been how few young people care about Russia and its socialist experience at all. Which is as it should be. The experience with socialism of a poor country in the 20th century is not that relevant to a rich country in the 21st century. For the older characters it does sometimes have multiple valences. Some of it is their youth and their idealism. LG: It's been an exciting few weeks on that front here in the US, certainly in New York, with Ocasio-Cortez's win. Andrei becomes a socialist in Russia, though at the end of the novel, with his return to the US and his cushy academic job, it's not clear how steadfast that position will remain . . . In my case, it was my encounter with Russian capitalism. The ideological journey that Andrei goes through in the book is a journey that I took over the course of many more years. And that there were huge numbers of victims that everyone just wished would die off. And that the criminality and inequality that accompanied them were not some kind of aberration of capitalism, but capitalism as it actually exists in most places in the world. Once I realized that, I found myself holding a very different view of capitalism. Andrei, in the book, basically sees how his grandmother has been immiserated by the post-Soviet reforms, but it requires him meeting Sergei and the others for him to kind of put it together into a story that makes sense. As for Andrei when he comes back, I think he becomes a leftist professor. He teaches his students about the ravages of the post-Soviet reforms. He hangs out on the fringes of Occupy. He joins DSA. I hope he has the courage to support the grad students and the adjuncts in their fight for union protections. LG: The portrayal of antisemitism felt very deftly done and true. KG: Antisemitism is tricky. And they started this mass movement which eventually led to the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which tied US-Soviet trade relations to the Soviets' willingness to release Jews. But there were some problems. And while the American Jews may have believed that there was another Holocaust on the way, there wasn't. At least not after 1953. There were restrictions on Jews, and there was antisemitism in public life, but there weren't pogroms and there certainly wasn't a genocide. But once this movement got going, there was no stopping it. So the joke was on Israel. But it was also on the American Jews. There's a really nice story in David Bezmozgis's first collection, Natasha, about a Canadian doctor who was active in helping to free Soviet Jews having two immigrant families over for dinner and basically insisting that they compete to tell him the most horrible story about their lives in the USSR. And it was tricky, because I think my parents were genuinely very happy to have come here, and were grateful to the Jewish agencies. At the same time, they had no interest in organized Jewish religion, and also no one likes to be condescended to, especially when, you know, most of the people who came over at that time had multiple advanced degrees. It was a pretty sophisticated group. Anyway, to bring this up to the present, there was a period after the Soviet collapse when Jews became very prominent in Russian political and economic life. A disproportionate number of the early oligarchs were Jewish. And one of the reasons given for this is that because Jews were in many cases cut off from the legitimate Soviet economy, they had become adept at working in the gray and black markets, and when the whole country became a gray and black market, they were well-positioned to take advantage. Though in some cases, too, these people were quite successful in the official Soviet system. But it is part of the nationalist discourse, and it does come up now and again. And it doesn't usually come up. The Eastern Europeans came in and started arguing that communism was just as bad as Nazism, and that actually nationalism is good and healthy. In the US until very recently, Holocaust memory was deployed as a way of justifying the actions of Israel and also to argue that Jews couldn't possibly be oppressors because they had themselves been oppressed. Obviously there can be different uses of history and memory. One of the things that interested me in the novel was the grandmother's actual relationship to the communist past and the capitalist present. She hated communism. But she misses much of the life and culture of that time. IN THE EARLY HOURS of Thursday morning, the Israeli Knesset passed a sweeping law reserving the right to self-determination exclusively for the Jews. In recent years there have been those who have tried to undermine that and question the principles of our existence. Netanyahu was not speaking in metaphor. The legislation quite literally enshrines Israel as the nation-state of only the Jews, Hebrew as its only official language, Hatikva as its only national anthem, and the Star of David flag and menorah as its national symbols. For a country whose population is more than a fifth Arab (not including the 4.4 million Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank who live under Israeli blockade and occupation), the nation-state bill is a remarkable step toward codifying and entrenching systematic discrimination against Arabs in Israeli society and government policy. But apartheid is not the only logical comparison in global politics that comes to mind. And in Austria, the chancellor of the leading right-wing party, whose governing coalition includes a party with extensive ties to the Nazis, took a trip to Israel the same week that his government moved to close down mosques and expel imams from Austria. Of course, this bill is merely icing on the cake, a fine-point detailing of a fundamentally discriminatory societal arrangement that has long been obvious to anyone who has bothered to look. I've camped in Teddy Roosevelt National Park and seen a bull snake that was five feet long. I've been in Fargo and I've been through Bismark and I've seen Native American poverty from my car window. Two months ago I shipped a carton of winter coats and clothing to the Standing Rock encampment, where thousands of people are now protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the serious threats it poses to water and environmental safety and to indigenous peoples' culture and autonomy. I have friends and acquaintances who have done a lot more than ship clothing to North Dakota. This pipeline is slated to carry Bakken Crude Shale Oil, fracked in North Dakota, beneath 200 different waterways to a refinery in Chicago. The original plans called for it to cross under the Missouri River close to Bismarck, ND. No man-made thing lasts forever, pipelines routinely leak. I have come to understand that they are fighting for all of us. They are first and foremost protecting the Earth and are on the frontline against global warming, willing to risk their lives. Every day at the camp there is two-hour non-violent training session. On a day that I attended there were over 50 people, mostly new arrivals from the Comanche Nation in Oklahoma. It was repeatedly stressed that this is non-violent, peaceful action and that is under the rubric of Ceremony. There are about 40 teepees and hundreds of tents at Standing Rock, housing about 1500 people. Over 300 Native Nations have sent representatives at different times in this unprecedented show of unity. Each time a delegation arrives they are invited to the main circle to share a dance and a sacred song. Several times during Yom Kippur we collectively confess a long list of misdeeds against other. It acknowledges that we all make mistakes and that each of us bears responsibility. We intone throughout the day the compassionate qualities of the Divine as we pray for forgiveness for our transgressions against other people. This year Yom Kippur is October 12 the original Columbus Day. . Past the road closed sign. Then the encampment comes into sight. Flags, banners, people walking in the road. At the main entry, a check point with signs for no alcohol or drugs, no pictures, we are directed to the medical tent -- straight down and to the left. And windy). The medical tent is a mishmash. About 20 feet in circumference, with supplies in messy boxes and cases around the edge and a few white plastic lawn chairs for patients. With a table in back for patients who need to lay down or providers. We were told to not change the order of anything. This to us and an ER nurse from California. But there was an ER doc here for a few days and no one to cover last night. . . Because we were promptly volunteered to work tonight 8pm to 8am. There are four cook tents with fabulous food. Tonight, we went over and had moose meatloaf and tapenade, cheesy vegetables, fresh pineapple for desert. So we are sleeping in the medical tent, which is a yurt full of medicines in plastics bins and a few chairs to see folks. Mostly respiratory problems, aggravated by the cold and wood smoke. Minor injuries. Strep. Someone gave us brand new sleeping bags. There is a larger 'warming' tent where Josh is now. And Bernie Sanders, an early supporter of the protests, has called on Obama to turn the site into a protected federal monument. I think what we have done is, number one, demanded that the president do what he did with Keystone. A lot of people put a lot of pressure on the president, and he finally did the right thing. And that is to kill the Keystone pipeline, which, by the way, under a Trump may be reopened again. But that is what he should be doing. And certainly, the demand must go to the North Dakota authorities that the kind of military presence that exists there is simply not what is acceptable. So, we have written to the president."}, {"URL": "https://lastrealindians.com/update-nodapl-water-protector-court-cases/", "Timestamp": "20180919002809", "Sentences": "'script', 'twitter-wjs'); Of the 831 state arrests from Standing Rock, 578 have concluded so far. A large majority of those, (337), were won through dismissal or acquittal at trial. This is a huge success for Water Protectors and for the many attorneys and legal workers who have been working steadily for over a year and half and are continuing those efforts unabated. However these numbers are also clear evidence that these arrests should never have occurred in the first place. Below is some information about the most common ways that cases can be resolved if they are not dismissed and the Water Protector chooses not to take it to trial, as well as an update on the trials that are scheduled to happen throughout the spring. Everyone with pending criminal charges has an absolute right to fight their charges all the way through trial. Water Protector Legal Collective is advocating fiercely on behalf of all Water Protectors with open cases, working diligently to extend the broadest range of positive outcomes possible and to support everyone through the full process, from arrest through motion practice and discovery and to trial. An important aspect of this work is negotiating favorable non-cooperating pretrial resolution offers that are one option available to Water Protectors for resolving their cases without going to trial. In general, this is not necessarily an indicator of the strength of the cases, but unfortunately is simply a reflection of the fact that these resolutions are almost always pose less risk than taking a case to trial, and in many cases the risks of going to trial are extremely high. Going to trial can be financially and psychologically burdensome on an individual and their loved ones, and exposes people to potentially serious criminal and other types of consequences and impacts. This means they do not require snitching or giving any testimony, evidence or other information to be used against someone else. In the state cases, they also are all offers that involve no additional jail time. WPLC is not aware of any deal being offered or accepted in any Standing Rock case that would require cooperation with the state or federal government to harm any other Water Protector. Non-cooperating plea agreements are a legitimate and honorable option to consider in light of your individual situation. People have widely varied circumstances and goals with respect to their court cases. There is no blanket answer to whether or not it is a good choice to make, and which factors matter most will be different for everyone. As of April 17th, 226 Water Protectors have chosen to accept some form of pretrial agreement and many more are considering whether or not to do so. If you are rearrested during that time period and that fact becomes known to Morton County prosecutors they could decide to sentence you for the charge you pled guilty to, but your attorney would still have an opportunity to negotiate or litigate what the sentence or other consequence should be. A deferred imposition of sentence can also be imposed by the court as a sentence after a trial if someone has been convicted. This has been a common outcome in the Standing Rock cases where to date we have had 19 Water Protectors convicted at trial, and five of those were sentenced to Deferred Imposition of Sentence. As of April 24, 122 Water Protectors have accepted Deferred Imposition of Sentence agreements instead of going to trial. This is different from a plea agreement because it does not require a plea or acknowledgment of guilt. This fee can either be paid to the state or can be paid to one of a list of approved nonprofits (including some that work to support indigenous peoples in North Dakota). An element of this type of agreement is that prosecutors do reserve the right to reopen and prosecute the case if a new arrest comes to their attention during the time period specified in the agreement. Because these diversions do not require a guilty plea, if the case is brought back to life you would then be back at the same place and with all the same options available to you as if you had not agreed to the pretrial diversion (you could still negotiate a plea agreement or fight your case and take it to trial at that time). As of April 24, 2018, 106 Water Protectors have accepted Pretrial Diversions. They and other attorneys have also been discussing potential civil claims with certain people who were arrested on October 27, 2016, and other dates. Accepting a plea agreement or pretrial diversion could result in you not being able to be included in these potential lawsuits. If you were injured by law enforcement at Standing Rock during the fall or winter of 2016-2017, or if you were arrested on October 22, 2016, you can contact our civil litigation team here. Anyone considering a future civil claim should discuss the pros and cons of a plea or diversion agreement with your criminal defense attorney and with your civil attorney. Attorney Obligations: Lawyers have an ethical obligation to advise their clients as to what, in their opinion, is the least risky course of action. They also must always relay the details of any plea offers to their clients. Like all decisions about litigation, the decision about whether or not to accept a plea always remains solely with the client. There are often very good reasons to encourage a client to accept a plea offer or a pretrial diversion, or to encourage them to reject a plea or diversion and take their case to trial. Factors to weigh include: the terms of the plea or other pretrial agreement being offered, what risks or possible harms that particular client faces given their individual circumstances, the maximum penalties they face, the strength of the case against them, and the availability and interest of each client to engage in ongoing court dates or trial (which in these cases may involve a significant amount of travel back to North Dakota). Decisions about whether or not to accept an offer can be very emotional and difficult to make. It is always an individual and deeply personal choice and ultimately each Water Protector must make their own decisions about it. If you feel that your attorney is inappropriately pressuring you to accept a plea agreement that you do not want, please call the WPLC hotline at (701) 566-9108 and we will do our best to find you a new lawyer at no cost to you. Upcoming Trials: WPLC is continuing to actively support and represent Water Protectors who have chosen not to accept any offered plea agreement, or who have not been offered plea agreements. Please check our website and Facebook pages regularly for news about these cases. WPLC remains committed to supporting Water Protectors in fighting their Standing Rock cases and we continue to advocate for the best possible range of options for Water Protectors to choose from to successfully resolve their cases. We will be happy to help you arrange for an effective lawyer to represent you at no cost to you. Our goal is to ensure that everyone facing charges as a result of the DAPL resistance has excellent legal representation."}, {"URL": "http://www.standard.net/National/2016/12/04/Army-will-deny-easement-halting-work-on-Dakota-Access-Pipeline.html", "Timestamp": "20180918230829", "Sentences": "High 86F.

Concerned that the pipeline would wreak havoc on the sacred sites and delicate wildlife in the area, a group of about 30 indigenous tribal members and allies moved to occupy the proposed construction site. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, a tribal historian and organizer, was confident as she spoke to reporters in April. They argued that the pipeline, which would pump as much as 570,000 barrels daily of fracked Bakken crude under the Missouri River, represents a major ecological threat as well as public health risk. Rather than comply with these requests, the USACE announced on July 26 that it had approved permits requested by Energy Transfer Partners to begin work on the pipeline. A coalition of lawyers and advocates issued a statement of protest on August 5, arguing that both tribal and environmental concerns were being disregarded. Further efforts have been spearheaded by the younger generation. Standing Rock Youth launched an online petition in the spring and gathered 166,140 signatories. When the USACE failed to respond, the group extended their run to Washington D.C. and New York City, traversing 2,000 miles to deliver the petition. Embed from Getty Images On Monday, the residents of spirit camp received a 48-hour notice that construction of the pipeline in their area would begin August 10. We are searching for every avenue through prayer to defeat this Black Snake. Protesters held out on the scene through the first night, but on August 11, local news sources reported arrests had begun. Activists posted videos online of civilians blocking the path to the construction site, some being forcibly removed by law enforcement. According to Brave Bull Allard, the crowd had grown to approximately 200 protesters by Thursday evening, including members of other Native tribes, non-Native allies, and even actress Shailene Woodley. While videos circulating online yesterday showed bulldozers breaking ground, the movement remains steadfast. Emboldened by solidarity and prayer, they will continue to stand their ground.

The Native American people were here on this land first, then these white people put them on reservations and restricted them so they are constantly poor, now the white people want to use their land for FREE.

My father prophesied that one day our home territory in NE Kansas would be a desert. At the time, I just listened. Now, I can see how that can be a reality. Cynthia mann August 13, 2016 at 4:07 pm Our Native Americans have suffered far more injustice than is imaginable. This is just one more. They fought on the exact same grounds to stop the pipeline coming through. Its the same thing except for the fact that they are discriminating against Native Americans again. Send the information to TRANS-CANADIAN pipeline to show them that Nebraska changed its mind. All other states were on board except them. What an obvious move of discrimination of Native Americans. Even after the EPA and everyone said no. It worked for Nebraska. This is more than the same situation with Native American sacred ground. We lose our God given rights and those afforded by the constitution every day. They got rough with the Native Americans to protect their lands but the BLM (black lives matter) protesters do what they want, inciting hatred and violence. Look at the police officers that lost their lives. The reservation belongs to the Native Americans and are supposed to be protected by the Federal Government.

Mother Earth is suffering the 600 poison chemicals they pump into her through fracking. The spilled oil from the sub-par pipes used in the pipelines that blacken the land for days at a time before anyone ever discovers it. The pollution pumped into the water and air. They have no respect for the earth that gives them life. I guess no one needs to use it after they are gone. Nothing is more important than the greed of money. They are sick demented souls that thinks money is God. I pray our God to save the land and our earth from the likes of greed that put money over the rights of others.

The ACLU of North Dakota posted an article in August, 2016 stating that the curbing of peaceful protests at the construction site of the pipeline violates the First Amendment. Law enforcement is using military equipment against these protesters. Robert Allen, a reporter at the Detroit Free Press, covered the protests in Standing Rock in December. Not once did he have any interaction law enforcement officers because they would have seen his approach as a hostile one. Allen attributed the peace between protesters and law enforcement to the presence of veterans at the reservation. There have been instances where oil was spilled and ruined entire ecosystems. For example, in 2010 when the BP-operated Macondo Prospect spilled about 5 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico and killed 11 workers. The pipeline is not directly on native land, but it crosses the Missouri River, which could be a threat to the tribes who have reservations close to it. Scott said. Seasonal issues can come in place, especially migration and breeding. Once you take one little piece out of an ecosystem, it changes it. Besides environmental issues the pipeline may cause, people are upset because it will affect native land. About Jessica Hanna Jessica is a student journalist at Michigan State University.

You are a fukin idiot. Ohh noo big bag government. But, I guess having some guys walk around is really that much of an imposition. Sheila Orr You are obviously living in oblivion. Wake up. Witchwindy The federal government was forbidden by the Constitution to own any lands beyond the 10 mile square of DC and forts and ports. So the Bundys were doing nothing wrong, Constitutionally, it is the government that is doing wrong. gorgegirl You are a perfect example of idiots not knowing what is in the US Constitution. ARTICLE IV, SECTION 3, CLAUSE 2 The federal government owns or controls about thirty percent of the land in the United States. These holdings include national parks, national forests, recreation areas, wildlife refuges, vast tracts of range and wasteland managed by the Bureau of Land Management, reservations held in trust for Native American tribes, military bases, and ordinary federal buildings and installations. Although federal property can be found in every state, the largest concentrations are in the west, where, for example, the federal government owns over eighty percent of the land within Nevada. The primary constitutional authority for the management and control of this vast real-estate empire is the Property Clause. The Property Clause simply allows Congress to act as an ordinary owner of land. It can set policy regarding whether such lands will be sold or retained and, if they are retained, who may enter these lands and for what purposes. Go read the U.S. Constitution. Territory is not even land that the government owns; it is land that the government holds in trust for the states. Once a state petitions to become a state and a member of the Union, that is no longer a territory, and the federal government has no authority over it. That state then becomes an independent, free and sovereign government. You cannot be a state and still be a territory. The federal government has no lawful control over any land in the states outside forts and ports and 10 square miles for Washington, D.C. I challenge anyone, because you cannot. There is no authority for the federal government to dictate to the states or the people how they operate their land. Article 6, Section 2, Clause 2, says that no law made contrary to the Constitution is valid. The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the land, and any statute, to be valid, must be in agreement. It is impossible for both the Constitution and a law violating it to be valid; one must prevail. This is succinctly stated as follows: The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having the form and name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void, and ineffective for any purpose; since unconstitutionality dates from the time of its enactment, and not merely from the date of the decision so branding it. An unconstitutional law, in legal contemplation, is as inoperative as if it had never been passed. Such a statute leaves the question that it purports to settle just as it would be had the statute not been enacted. Since an unconstitutional law is void, the general principals follow that it imposes no duties, confers no rights, creates no office, bestows no power or authority on anyone, affords no protection, and justifies no acts performed under it . . . A void act cannot be legally consistent with a valid one. An unconstitutional law cannot operate to supersede any existing valid law. Indeed, insofar as a statute runs counter to the fundamental law of the land, it is superseded thereby. No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no courts are bound to enforce it. (late 2nd Ed. If that law is arbitrary to the constitution, if it renders you subject to illegal or unconstitutional laws and acts it is in fact, null and void. Keep this in mind when the courts rule in favor of corporate interests knowingly violating the rights and protections afforded the people as described in the Constitution. Almost without exception, every law that has been passed by one administration and congress after another in the last twenty years has substantially violated and reduced the rights of Americans. You have guaranteed rights only so long as you defend them from encroachment by the government. Barry McLawhorn Congratulations you just exposed yourself as a troll. No more food for you. We have natural resources on our land that we understand that needs to be protected. The waste incurred by the government to conduct these ridiculous studies if profane, especially in the face of the utter failure of government to ameliorate the suffering and decline that is present in American human society from sea to shining sea. Finding a frog in the creek on your property is not going to cause any restrictions on the use of the property for the owners. I know of property that has the Western turtle around these ponds. Excalibur We do. That is also the reason we did not get what the land was really worth. The US Government always pays the appraised value from an independent appraiser. Like I said, I am a real estate broker in two states which are in a national scenic area. I also know that the government only takes by eminent domain the amount of land they need. If they only need 10 acres, they will try to get only the 10 acres and nothing more. You reek of hate and a bunch of bull. The republicans on the US Supreme court did make a big mistake when they allowed a private party to claim eminent domain for water front condos in Connecticut. It is time for the US Supreme court to correct that mistake. My, my what a sorry state of mind you have. You will get what they offer, nothing more if you ask or even try to work with them. That is also the reason we did not get what the land was really worth. In the process, we were threatened with that answer. gorgegirl No matter what someone with knowledge has, people like you will never believe it anyway because you choose to have your head up your butt. The death or one of the owners, the ownership passes to the survivor. Or maybe OUR status changed at some point that we were not aware of at some time and this is why this couple can absolutely do what they are doing because they know they are not slaves. John Farrell If they decide they like your land they can find a reason they have to have it. scott young Sorry, but you are just plain wrong. If they did find the frog you would be promptly be made a steward of said frog. If the frog died off you would be held legally responsible. They told him what they would pay and if he did not take it he would receive way less. Probaly the same where these people live only thing may not be the forest service could be a city county state blm etc. gorgegirl Your father probably had an inflated value attached to his property. And, he could contest the appraisal if he was aware of other sales that were comparable that sold for more. But, it is required that the US Forest Service, the BPA or any other government agency pay the fair market value for property they acquire. I wonder if you have ever been envolved with land and imminent domain. I witnessed this myself first hand and know how it was done. And no the land was not over valued by my dad it was what he had been offered for the land prior to the forest service taking it. Some in the area hired attorneys and postponed it for a short time but then a federal judge ordered them off the property or go to jail. Some of the people had lived there all. Their lives not only them but parents and grandparents before them Excalibur That is exactly what happened to us. Steven Davis No, I think all of your comments actually highlight this situation and others like it. This conversation is highlighting the ability of manipulating media in order to push for a specific outcome verses private people trying to protect what is rightfully theirs. For this gorgegirl, who is commenting on the government can do no wrong is an identification of how they, the government or parts of it who are relegated to an agenda use media comments, editorials, social web pages etc, and especially news, to direct people to how they are working to accomplish their agenda. (Mainly property, home, real-estate etc). The frustration for many of us individuals is that when laws are used against us and our hard work, it seems they are manipulating laws and rules of governing for the favor of the few who will benefit. Because we are not going to get it back argueing about it over social media, however, it is here where will can find others who are interested in learning more. Kudos. Michael Jones The U.S. was established as a result of intrusive government. You seem to have a libtard view of government.

If you are going to be victimized by an abusive govt in the first place, and will still end up victimized in the end, not taking a stand for your private property rights is not only cowardly, but just stupid. I would rather go down fighting than to be a coward and not even fight for myself. If the Founding Fathers thought like you, there would never be an America. Thank God they did not think like you.

EboTebo Is Al short for Alvin or Alfred, or were your parents too lazy to use more than two letters because they came to the conclusion that through minimizing your name there would be less chance of them forgetting you existed. Al Wilson Your lack of gray matter is only exceeded by your stupidity ebotebo. gbp91 your kidding or just insanely quacked out Icorps1970 Citations please. Then we will cite Hillary and Obama. Just for a comparison scott young Wrong. Woody That was awesome, but i woulda just told them to fuck off. John Story That man is a fucking asshole. because he is. This is a guy with a job to count frogs. Jim Jimjim Hopefully they will take it. SteveforAmerica Wait till these people start screwing around with your life and property in an arbitrary and dictatorial fashion. Jim Jimjim Hopefully he gets charged with a misdemeanor for this cute little stunt. Derek Hopefully you choke on your tongue in your sleep. Evelyn Swart This is pretty clever. However I am tired of this idea that the government is the enemy. The people who work for the government are generally good people who care about doing a good job. The recipients of this letter probably got a kick out of it, because they are people with a sense of humor. Johnny Thorne The current government IS the enemy. These people are evil, only too happy to enforce the fascist regulations of this oppressive and ever-growing government. Makes you look brilliant. And mannerless. Putz. Ever so much nicer. Robert Hoover Yeh. Now go shovel some more shit in the barn and relax. So , good night , sweety. The Deer was roaming free , not an enclosed pet.

If you are raising a lot of livestock, go grab a pitchfork and muck out a few stalls to relieve your tensions. hahahaha Brenda Sore loser. Wulver Put the vitriol at the end of the comment. Yes, that seems logical. Of course there could have been a chemical spill upstream and they want to quietly check the levels of poison in the water. Good people work there and a lot of bad people work there. Some who want to throw their weight around. I think your smart and you laid it on ole Robert pretty good though, so I like you. They all want to save the planet, one blade of grass, one frog or one useless fish at a time. Science no longer matters to these agencies in their rule making process. Everything is agenda driven. Reforming the liberal courts will help, but unfortunately, Trump cannot fix this in two terms so hopefully conservatives stay in power for decades to come. I do appreciate living in a nation of laws and I am grateful for the services the government provides. I see myself as a part of a cooperative otherwise known as the government of the people, for the people and by the people. Of course if you are a Zionist you will never admit that. If an endangered frog is found on that small property parcel, it will instantly be rendered useless, uninhabitable (except for the frog) and no longer marketable. They are indifferent and no government has ever had the benefit of a collective as a goal. Lydia Long Brilliant. normanramsey I am truly puzzled. Jack.Foobar The same way 40 year old ISIS members are considered refugee children. The definition of a ranch is a farm where cattle or other animals are bred and raised. JohnL1313 The same way a man with a penis can call himself a woman. mrhdiver I am cracking up. jag11 Well done. Handling bureaucrats with bureaucracy. Brilliant and fighting fire with fire. Cream Of Weber Sounds like a real POS. Derek You sound like a real moron. So thats scary. Being responsible for them wouldnt be good. No thanks. Lophatt Beautiful. Insult grade: D xlaurenstephens because he is really a she and has a vagina. Chuck Breuninger- Rick Charles Sounds like you must have had a bad experience in one of our privatized prisons somewhere.

However, humans 1st evolved in Africa..starting approximately 7-8 million years ago. They do though. So rant and rave about the Clinton family praying and going to church etc. Hey, take the Carter family to task too. So come on. Please, let us hear you scream about how horrible every one of those Democrats is. Scream how Reverends Jesse Jackson, Martin Luther King, Jr., Andrew Young, Mason Durell Bertha (aka Mase), Smokie Norful, Anthony Campolo (spiritual advisor to President Bill Clinton by the way), Gerardo, Marvin Sapp, Creflo Dollar, Bayard Rustin, etc. have all been crazy as prominent Democrats that are or were ministers too. I guess your real complaint is that folks are not Democrats so this list is all wonderful although they are members of the clergy. As for your God, the Blessed Obutthole, he has been a disaster for this country, among other things, he is giving 130 tons of uranium to Iran, a terrorist nation. Look how well that has worked out in Europe. I guess they accidently aborted your brain. I do see the public education lessons stayed with you well though. Bob643 Everybody just stop feeding the troll. That is what he wants. Flag him for hate speech, inappropriate language, and ad hominem attacks. hardh8 I agree, Cry, whine and be a snitch bitch. Just like the libRETARDS a do do. expected WELFARE). A bunch of DUMB WHITE MORONS didnt have enough sense to convict them in Oregon (yet masses of White people still are upset over O.J.). Suck that scock and suck this cock. If you want another mans cock. No jobs are coming back to America, lol. No wall is going to be built, lol. Masses of illegals ARE NOT going to be deported. You Conservative Jesus Freaks are too stupid to realize that no wall needs to be built to stem the tide of illegal immigration. it a felony, punishable by at least one year in jail (mandatory) for any employer to hire an illegal (business owner AND management). You wouldnt need to employ a mass deportation force NOR build a wall. No one would hire illegals because they would fear going to jail. Anthony N Kimmie Nichols It seems that you have politics figured out. I hope that you are feeling better now that you have had a chance to vent. It is very unfortunate that Mrs. Clinton cannot be your president, I understand that you are upset. When my children were so upset because they did not get their way, they would violently scream and cry. That was short lived, because they are no longer two and understand that others may not want to play the same game that they like. I am sorry that you are sad. There may still be enough time to get the government to chip in and buy you a bear to cuddle while you go through this tragic time. Best wishes and as always, warm regards. Trump will have his 4 years as President to show what a fucked up President he is. Sometimes, The Masses have to reach a point of being sick and tired of being sick and tired. We do not need any of you Jesus Freaks coming here to RUIN Everything. our own people. hardh8 I notice all the homosexual references in your comments. We have a system of government that has allowed for eventual change. a White guy wasnt good enough, lol. Glenn Griffith BEST RESPONSE EVER. Glenn Griffith Actually, I do think this idiot is actually stupid enough to believe that. Pass the pipe before you smoke yourself into an asylum Paul Lentz Uh look Sling Blade. led to our ancestors (who were small, fury little rodent-like creatures who scavenged for food) evolving into a variety of mammal-like animals. By the way, I am a GEOLOGIST, and understand the passage of time on this planet wayyyy better than you ever will, and I can tell you that what you are spewing makes ZERO sense. WE(Mankind) honestly has NO IDEA where or WHEN we came from, and the only credible story we can find is looking at HISTORY books like the BIBLE among other books, that tell the story of our creation. try having an open mind, and looking at things from an intelligent perspective, instead of just being a ranting TROLL. But I WILL pray for you. you really are one screwed up puppy. Sick puppies are cute, but still sick. This property has this frog. destravlr . This is not a lesson on how to handle government. Tea Party folk are deluded into wanting power for whatever favorite issue they dream up. Doing so opens them to being sucked into findings of FYLF habitat that will take all control of the land from them. The Center for Biological Diversity has been known to plant yellow legged frogs in previously areas previously uninhabited by YLF in order to get legal control for pushing to have USF&W designated endangered habitat. If you read his disqus profile that has his past postings on various subjects, he actually has some that are coherent. But then this, that we read here. I feel sorry for him. There are THOUSANDS UPON THOUSANDS of churches in America. You MOFOS still have freedom to worship. Cowboss I see. So this ranting you are doing has nothing to do with the actual article, you just hate religious people and religion and assume that all of us commenting here are religious. I certainly understand where you are coming from now. MMMMKAY. . . Paul Lentz I assume that all right wingers are wacko jesus freaks. Tea baggers are known for being gun totting jesus freaks who hate gays. While, for example, it is estimated that approximately one to three million people were tragically killed in the Crusades, and perhaps 3,000 in the Inquisition, nearly 35 million soldiers and civilians died in the senseless, and secular, slaughter of World War 1 alone. History simply does not support the hypothesis that religion is the major cause of conflict. The wars of the ancient world were rarely, if ever, based on religion. These wars were for territorial conquest, to control borders, secure trade routes, or respond to an internal challenge to political authority. In fact, the ancient conquerors, whether Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, or Roman, openly welcomed the religious beliefs of those they conquered, and often added the new gods to their own pantheon. Medieval and Renaissance wars were also typically about control and wealth as city-states vied for power, often with the support, but rarely instigation, of the Church. And the Mongol Asian rampage, which is thought to have killed nearly 30 million people, had no religious component whatsoever. Victor Vandiver Slavery enters human history with civilization. Hunter-gatherers and primitive farmers have no use for a slave. They collect or grow just enough food for themselves. One more pair of hands is one more mouth. There is no economic advantage in owning another human being. Once people gather in towns and cities, a surplus of food created in the countryside (often now on large estates) makes possible a wide range of crafts in the town. On a large farm or in a workshop there is real benefit in a reliable source of cheap labour, costing no more than the minimum of food and lodging. These are the conditions for slavery. Every ancient civilization uses slaves. And it proves easy to acquire them. War is the main source of supply, and wars are frequent and brutal in early civilizations. When a town falls to a hostile army, it is normal to take into slavery those inhabitants who will make useful workers and to kill the rest. There are several other ways in which slaves are acquired. Pirates offer their captives for sale. A criminal may be sentenced to slavery. An unpayable debt can bring the end of liberty. The impoverished sell their own children. Victor Vandiver Causes of Child Labor Child labor persists even though laws and standards to eliminate it exist. Poverty and unemployment levels are high. Poor children and their families may rely upon child labor in order to improve their chances of attaining basic necessities. The intensified poverty in parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America causes many children there to become child laborers. Glenn Griffith Ignorant pussy it appears, although multiple personality is a possibility. Oh, sorry, that word intelligent threw you for a loop. Srry. Mama needs to wash your pottymouth out with soap and kick you out of the basement. If there was truly environmental justice, the government would use its power of eminent domain and buy that chunk of the land off the people instead. Allowing the government onto their land to do a survey would almost certainly result in areas of their land being declared off limits for any sort of development or use if it was found to be a habitat (or potential habitat). David If I wrote the letter, my fees would have been way, way higher. Katie Sterling LOL Drew Brenneman I love the response given to the state. And all permits are one day use only. And the next day the prices double to allow the state to get access to the property. And just keep on going with fees and deny access to private property. Daniel A. Erskine They wrote their response in jest. 4. Try putting food in that incredibly ignorant mouth without rural citizen farmers. Herbie Barquist What an idiotic response Leon Shisler It may be that you have no Cities where you live but where I live there are more people in one city than all the rest of the County. There fore those people build most of the roads. The other part is that it seems that citizens like to comply with the rules and laws that help them but all others are for the other people to obey -not them. Wow are you delusional. Leon Shisler that was supposed to be County Darren Wilkens You lack basic English comprehension. Like Hank said, a country boy can survive. Lela Madera Many country roads are not much more than a cow trail that only a Jeep or horse can traverse. Bob Loblaw I shot a skunk once that was displaying the symptoms of rabies. A bullet was a more humane death than what nature had in store for it. Who the hell cares what happens in 100 years. Jeezus. And they asked pretty politely. Leon Shisler A little like Trump and his wall. William Piss off. LOL William You can piss off, too. a person Hot air, like whatever the chimp used to spew. Steven Davis Look up the first michigan assembly, The New Republic, review the writings of Judge Anna von Reitz, as you will see the current government is not what we expect it should be or was designed to be. CrustyB Also, do not make direct eye contact with the yellow-legged frog as it makes them speak like Jerry Lewis. Darren Wilkens This story has been floating around for awhile. Emmanuel Truthseeker When some state policy enforcement Israeli trained order taker creates an issue for you in order to generate business for the fraudulent jewish JUST US system and you are inconvenienced; invoice the court for your time and expenses. File it with the court clerk. Also, ask the judge to see his or her license and oath of office. Do that and see what happens. It is all such a pile of jewish malfeasance. That and the taxation systems. Good for you, hold on to that hate and completely unsubstantiated bias until you die. That way, it hopefully dies along with you. Nicholas Landholdt You want self-governance, then restore your State Militia. lol. Steven Davis Not only that, but all the individual items which had to be reviewed and paid for to proceed. Edit: Digging the responses. Some of them are going into my example folder for psychological projection and cognitive dissonance. Get back on your anti-psychotics. whoops123 Yeah, those damn invasive frogs. Some Americans still care about things other than themselves. Unfortunately these people are not in power at the moment. Sorry, world. a person Sorry, but Americans are in charge again, Thank GOD for the GOP kay Be honest. I can tell you to go to DE and check out how well they took care of their water. whoops123 If the feds wanted to cease the water rights, they would just do it. They would just use eminent domain to take it if necessary. Of course the waterways are getting polluted. kay Not hardly, under Obama yes, Under President Trump no. If they would have had more Money, which is controlled by politics and bankers, then they would try to imporve their quality of life. We are again on the verge of that right now, and your comments about this planet is only capable of sustaining 2, is really unacceptable. The fact is that we keep producing people while billions are starving and our planet is dying under the weight of the existing population and their insatiable greed. (Just look at how much money is put into ever election here in the USA). whoops123 Yes, it is a BS health care system. The unbridled greed of the corporations, Millionaires and Billionaires that have bought our government are the problem, not the people. It is not a liberal vs. conservative thing. It is a selfish greed thing. Jeff Hart Just a shocking post. a person Liberals kill and destroy everything they come across. ConcernedinNEFL Apparently what you do not understand DJEB is that had the owner granted the access to his property, as of the commencement of that survey he would have lost all control of it as well. If the frog was shown to live on his property he would have been prohibited from making any improvements, construction, and in some cases to even be outside in the area where the frogs lived because the government would have declared his property an endangered species habitat and virtually any action he would take on his own property would place him in violation as a threat to the species. He would lose all rights to the streams and waterways where those frogs live. ludwigtr Like they said, passive aggressive response to polite and reasonable request, also hating natural environment. Steven Davis It is a simple identification that those who are in support of world depopulation, and moving people into megacities to further control them are using sustainable living, endangered species, and requests such as these to eventually remove people from their homes. However most people respect the land and their property well enough to sustain it in the long run. This BS letter from the Gov was just the 1st step in seizing their land. The native americans were torn off of their property due to not having ownership of their land legally in terms of Admiralty law, in the name of preserving the natural environment. Only to almost wipe out the American Bison, Buffalo, after they kicked the indians off their land. Under Gods law, or the law of the land, they would have been entitled to keep their property. The same thing is going on with agencies trying to preserve the natural environment. It will be returned to its natural state when private property owners are kicked off their property in the name of preservation. How about you take my response and add it to your edit, identifying you are pushing your own psychological projection upon us stating we as Americans have this thing for hate. How about you surrender your property, and leave the country for your insults. You need to apologize to Americans who have the right to say no to uncalled for surveys and unwanted searches of private property. Suzy Selvidge Bravo I must say very well done. Hats off to you for being so creative in sending your reply. I wish I could have done that to various government inquiries that I received. Jeff Hart Soon, I am sure. Steven Davis The move for further surveys has been identified by a lot of private land and home-owners as a means of taking over their private property through an agenda associated with Agenda 21. Moving mass amounts of people out of the country and into Mega cities. This would allos them to better control the masses of people. The problem is, according the the Deagle documents, when these moves begin to happen, they are going to have to cull a lot of people. The world population they have listed with the Georgia guidestones and then supported by the Deagle future trends. (No I am not a conspiracy theorist, as the Deagle documents is a CIA supported organization, thus calling them fake, or made up is a widespread falsity. Someone is paying for the research to have the Deagle information match other information, and it is being done on purpose). (look up the true meaning of CITIZEN in the new constitution written after the civil war. But I will leave that for other discussions. JL Straight If you cannot see the humor of the LANDOWNERS request, then you are part of the problem of how the government has become way to big and intrusive on top of corrupt. Steven Davis Seems there quite a few insult people on here. As a nurse who has been in combat, seeing so many young people die for a position taken by government leaders who are pushing an agenda, rather than standing up for humanity, insults really upset people and I look at those who throw the insults, as political lobbyists who have an agenda rather than those who are interested in the betterment of humanity. Jeff Hart I would be fearful that they might stop my personal uses of my land or even steal my land from me which is happened in the past. So, I would decline also. Heartland Patriot Oh, yes, they would stop you from using your land. Remember, these are leftists, and to them, the government actually owns everything, and just lets you use it. They have no belief in property rights. This is the crap that needs to be cut. This is what bloated out of control gov looks like.

I wonder what it is like for people in Syria and Iraq who live in the shadow of ISIS. They challenge people to act in ways consistent with those hopes, desires, and dreams. And when they see people behaving in harmful ways, they warn them by picturing the future to which that harmful behavior will lead. Most scholars today agree that at least three people contributed to the book over a long period of time, but their combined work has traditionally be attributed to one author. The first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah were situated in the southern Kingdom of Judah, just before the northern Kingdom of Israel was invaded and colonized by the Assyrians. The prophet saw deep spiritual corruption and complacency among his people and warned them that this kind of behavior would lead to decline and defeat. After the invasion, many survivors were taken as exiles to Babylon. Chapters 40-55, often called Second Isaiah, addressed those Judean exiles, inspiring hope that they would someday return to their homeland and rebuild it. That soon happened, beginning in 538 BC under the leadership of Ezra and Nehemiah. Imagine with me for a moment what it was like for the people of Second Isaiah. Imagine what it was like for those who had been forcibly removed from their homes and taken into exile by the Babylonians. Yahweh, they believed, had promised them this land, but a foreign army had conquered them, removed them from their homes, and sent them into exile. Minidoka National Historic Site. The swimming hole Not that I was trying to mimic Isaiah, but my sabbatical can be divided into three parts. The first part was a great road trip that took me up the coast, across to Glacier National Park, south to Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons, and back home. It included, almost by accident, a stop at the Minidoka Internment Camp outside Twin Falls, Idaho. There is very little at the National Historical Park now: mostly open fields and gravel paths; a few concrete pads that were the foundations of garages and warehouses; a collapsing root cellar. The sentry tower and barbed wire fence are reconstructions. Only one of the original tarpaper barracks remains; the others were demolished or sold to farmers in the area, but only to white farmers. None of the internees were allowed to purchase any of the buildings or equipment that was deemed surplus after the war. Minidoka National Historic Site. Family barracks At its height, there were over 9,000 Japanese immigrants and Japanese-American citizens incarcerated in the camp, making Minidoka something like the fourth largest community in Idaho at the time. Like the Babylonian army, the U.S. Army forced these people out of their homes and businesses and placed them in concentration camps. According to the stories I read and heard at Minidoka, it was only through community that they were able to find hope. And, while the United States built the barracks, it was the people concentrated in the camp that built the community. Of course, the internment of people of Japanese ancestry is not the only exile in United States history. Aside from the elections, there was one news story that held my attention during my sabbatical: the story of the Standing Rock Sioux protesting the routing of the Dakota Access Pipeline through sacred lands and along and under important water sources for the Standing Rock and everyone downstream of them. Up until the past few weeks, the mainstream news media were pretty much ignoring the story. However, because the Dakota Access Pipeline is new fossil fuel infrastructure, organizations fighting climate change were paying attention, and that got my attention starting in August. On one level, this story sounds like every other story of the Indian Exile: white people with their police and military and corporations and courts giving Indians the shaft. Again. But something different is happening this time. This gives me hope, this community and solidarity that is growing around the globe. And because of that solidary (at least in part), this is now about way more than a particular pipeline in a particular place. The thing is, because the Standing Rock are grounding their movement in prayer, this clash has the real potential to work itself out in a way where we are all transformed and we are all winners. And that gives me hope. Enslaved and oppressed people hope for liberation. Wilderness wanderers desire a promised land where they can settle. If we read the prophets and the gospels in the Bible, one thing will be clear: While God loves everyone, God takes the side of the enslaved and oppressed, the wilderness wanderers and exiles, the people yearning for justice and peace. And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins. (Isaiah 2:4) The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them. The cow and the bear shall graze, their young shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. (Isaiah 11:6-7) Here is my servant, whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the nations. He will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street; a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice. For Malachi, the hearts of parents would turn to their children, and children to their parents. Amos paints the vivid scene of justice rolling down like a river, filling all the lowest places. It remained alive in people like Elizabeth and Zechariah, Mary and Joseph, and Anna and Simeon, and even among humble shepherds who lived at the margins of society. To be alive in the adventure of Jesus is to believe that the promised time is coming and that the promised land will be received. But that is only a wish and not true hope if it does not spur us to action. To be alive in the adventure of Jesus is to translate hope for the future into action in the present and to keep acting in light of it, no matter the disappointments, no matter the setbacks and delays.

You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. The standoff to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a fever pitch, and this may be our last chance to halt construction before Donald Trump takes office. Militarized law enforcement and private security firms are harassing, assaulting and jailing hundreds of non-violent protesters who are fighting for indigenous rights and to curb climate change. They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline.

Stratton, Author provided Every Thanksgiving weekend for the past 17 years, Arapaho and Cheyenne youth lead a 180-mile relay from the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site to Denver. The annual Sand Creek Massacre Spiritual Healing Run opens at the site of the Sand Creek Massacre near Eads, Colorado, with a sunrise ceremony honoring some 200 Arapaho and Cheyenne people who lost their lives in the infamous massacre. This brutal assault was carried out by Colonel John Chivington on Nov. 29, 1864. While the Sand Creek massacre has been the subject of numerous books, much less attention has been given to two heroes of this horrific event: U.S. soldiers Captain Silas Soule and Lt. Joseph Cramer. They did so by personally refusing to take part in the murder of peaceful people, while ordering the men under their command to stand down. Their example breaks the conventional frontier narrative that has come to define the clash between Colonial settlers and Native peoples as one of civilization versus savagery. Refusing to participate, Soule and the men of Company D of the First Colorado, along with Cramer of Company K, bore witness to the incomprehensible. Soule was a devoted abolitionist and one dedicated to the rights of all people. He stayed true to his convictions in the face of insults and even a threat of hanging from Chivington the night before at Fort Lyon. Both harshly condemned the massacre and the soldiers who carried it out. The horrific descriptions of Soule and Cramer prompted several official inquiries into the atrocity. Both men also testified before an Army commission in Colorado as witnesses. While the officers and soldiers responsible escaped punishment, their testimony brought widespread condemnation upon Chivington, who defended the massacre for the rest of his life. These investigations also ended the political career of the Colorado territorial governor, John Evans, who had issued two proclamations calling for violence against Native people of the plains, and for organizing the 3rd Colorado Cavalry Regiment in which Chivington was placed in command. This will be done through an offering of prayers and blessings, along with the performance of honor songs. The participants will then continue on to 15th and Lawrence Street in downtown Denver. There, a plaque is mounted on the side of an office building at the place where Soule was murdered on April 23, 1865. His death, for which no one was ever brought to justice, occurred only two months after he testified against Chivington before the Army commission. The catastrophe of the Sand Creek Massacre is recognized by historians as among the most infamous events in the annals of the American West. Even now, it is the only massacre of Native people recognized as such by the U.S. government, with the land itself preserved as a national historic site for learning and reflection. In Cheyenne and Arapaho stories, this event remains an ever-present trauma and persists as part of their cultural memory. In addition, it encapsulates the stark moment of betrayal against their ancestors and the theft of their lands. I maintain that it is people like Soule and Cramer who truly deserve to be remembered through monuments and memorials, and can be a source for a different kind of historical understanding: one based not on abstract notions of justice and right, but upon the courage and integrity it takes to breathe life into those virtues. On the 152nd anniversary of the Sand Creek Massacre, as we honor the memory of those who died at Sand Creek, may we also be inspired by the heroic actions of these two American soldiers.

Of course, there are good reasons why Mailer in particular should suffer posthumous obscurity with such alacrity: his brand of male essentialist braggadocio is arguably extraneous in the age of Trump, Weinstein, and fourth-wave feminism. Initially I had the impression I was being heard out, if reluctantly, but as the years have passed, my attempts to limn the shape of this epochal transformation have been met increasingly with outrage, and even abuse, in particular from my fellow writers. As for my attempts to express the impact of the screen on the page, on the actual pages of literary novels, I now understand that these were altogether irrelevant to the requirement of the age that everything be easier, faster, and slicker in order to compel the attention of screen viewers.

Corbyn is another feather in the wind of populism and a fragmentation of the old consensus and politesse. He was elected to the leadership by the party membership in 2015, and no one was more surprised than he. Between 1997 and 2010, Corbyn voted against his own party 428 times. He existed as an ideal, a rebuke to the Blairite leadership, and the only wise man on a ship of fools. His schtick is that of a weary, kindly, socialist Father Christmas, dragged from his vegetable patch to create a utopia almost against his will. But in 2015 the ideal became, reluctantly, flesh. Satirists mock him as Jesus Christ, and this is apt. But only just. He courts sainthood, and if you are very cynical you might say that, like Christ, he shows Jews what they should be. He once sat on the floor of a crowded train, though he was offered a first-class seat, possibly as a private act of penance to those who had, at one time or another, had no seat on a train. When Corbyn became leader of the Labour Party, the British media, who are used to punching socialists, crawled over his record and found much to alarm the tiny Jewish community of 260,000. He invited the Islamist leader Raed Salah, who has accused Jews of killing Christian children to drink their blood, to Parliament, and opposed his extradition. He was an early supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement and its global campaign to delegitimize Israel and, through the right of return for Palestinians, end its existence as a Jewish state. (His office now maintains that he does not support BDS. Corbyn freed something. The scandals bloomed, swiftly. In 2016 Naz Shah, Labour MP for Bradford West, was suspended from the party for sharing a Facebook post that suggested Israel be relocated to the United States.

By Edwin Dobb If necessity is the stern but respectable mother of invention, then perhaps desperation is the derelict father of subterfuge. That was certainly the case when I moved to Seattle in 1979. Not only had rent increased sharply in all but the most destitute neighborhoods, landlords now routinely demanded first, last, and a hefty security deposit, which meant I was short by about fifty percent. Over the first week or so, I watched with mounting anxiety as food, gas, and lodging expenses reduced the meager half I did have to a severely deficient third. To make matters even more nerve-racking, I was relocating with my nine-year-old son, Ezra. More than my well-being was at stake. The house needed a new roof, a couple of coats of paint, and, judging by what Ezra and I could detect during a furtive inspection, major repair work inside, including replacing damaged plaster-and-lath walls with sheetrock. All of this, from my standpoint, meant that I might have found a solution to my dilemma. I called the person listed on the rolls and made an appointment. Then came the moment of truth, or, more precisely, untruth, when dire circumstance begot strategic deception. To my immense relief, the pretense was well received. Sign in here. Subscribe here.

It really breaks my heart. Monet explains despite the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), which mandates law enforcement nationwide to lend assistance during emergencies or disasters, Governor Steve Bullock had concerns the agreement was being misused. I have been in protest situations in my career and fully understand that in many cases law enforcement is placed in the middle of two emotional opposing interests and we have to attempt to balance our role as peace officer and law enforcement. Many of you emailed and called the Office to voice your concerns. As your Sheriff I was very humbled by the honest conversations we had. One of the biggest differences of an elected Sheriff from other law enforcement leaders is that I am directly accountable to the people I serve (YOU) and although I am personally torn knowing that people (Including Montanans) are hurting over there, we will not be responding. Finally I am incredibly grateful that we live in a place where we can have differences and talk about them respectfully as adults without conflict. Gootkin and the Gallatin County deputies never made it to North Dakota, but other departments briefly assisted the Morton County Sheriff, and then refused to complete planned rotations, pulled out, and never returned. However, water protectors and independent journalists on the scene contend law enforcement brutalized water protectors, disrespectfully disassembled tipis, and refused to allow anyone to gather their belongings. Some claimed when they returned to the scene much later, officers had carelessly thrown tents, clothing, and other items in a pile, leaving all of it damaged and soaked in what seemed to be ammonia and urine. In short, public pressure can be surprisingly effective. Some have since returned from those deployments while others may still be present in North Dakota. Considering the success of public outcry in forcing law enforcement to reconsider policing the Standing Rock movement to protect the water, following is the contact information from the websites for the appropriate North Dakota officials and law enforcement departments from all states, as listed by the ACLU.

The establishment, by contrast, wants a meager sprinkling of that program, but only insofar as it does not alienate the donor class. That brings me to the upcoming election for leader of the Democratic National Committee. The two leading candidates are Tom Perez, secretary of labor under Obama and establishment team player; and Keith Ellison, a congressman from Minnesota and leading representative of the party's Bernie Sanders wing. Superficially, the two have quite similar politics. But in practice, it's quite obvious that Perez is basically a sock puppet for the establishment and the donor class. This makes him unsuited to conduct the political overhaul necessary to get the party back in fighting shape. But more telling evidence came this week, when Perez slipped up and admitted the obvious, that the 2016 Democratic primary election was heavily slanted towards Hillary Clinton. And you've got to be honest about it. Perez was unquestionably right about this. The admitted, overt purpose of superdelegates, for example, is to allow party elites to partially overturn the will of primary voters if they see fit. Now, Bernie Sanders did benefit from other dubiously democratic aspects of the primary system, like the bizarre caucus system in some states, and it's probably true that in a scrupulously fair open primary he still would have lost. But it's also obvious that party elites have a hugely outsize sway over the primary process, and they connived from the start to clear the decks for Clinton. Whole books are written about this process. No. That is true, though in a hypothetical popular vote election both candidates would have run a different election campaign. But more importantly, the party downballot is a smoking crater, in the worst shape since 1928. The Obama presidency has been a slow-motion collapse of the party at all levels. To rebuild, Democrats obviously need to start winning some elections, particularly the 2018 midterms, which could set the stage for a 2020 victory at the state level when redistricting happens again. The most reliably left-wing (and the most anti-Trump) demographic in the country at the moment is young people. But young people often don't vote in midterms, so the party must try to convince them to turn out. Sanders inspired tremendous enthusiasm among this group with his calls for universal Medicare, tuition-free college, repealing Citizens United, fighting police brutality, and so on. But that sort of agenda would require huge increases in taxation on entrenched power and the rich. It is thus squarely at odds with the class interest of the donors Clinton spent half her campaign huddled with (not to mention the business titan Barack Obama has been kitesurfing with since Trump took power). What's more, it would represent a sharp diminution of their own power within the party as an institution, which elites virtually always resist even at the cost of hurting the institution itself. But if the Democrats are to mount an angry populist assault on President Trump and the Republican Party, they can't have a leader whose leash is attached to the hands of the people who got them into this mess in the first place.

A battle, both peaceful and violent, is brewing. Unless you try not to listen. Counties and rivers wear the nomenclature of tribes and chiefs, their names sounding like a haunting whisper over the unsteady roads of the past. That, after three centuries of effort, America finally erased the song of a colorful history that had existed prior and learned to peacefully coexist with its lingering echo. It undermines the great mythology of our culture: that progress, in whatever form it may arrive, will come. Standing Rock strikes at the base nature of America. In the shadow of the protests at Standing Rock is an intersection of two crucial fights. The other is the fight over Planet Earth itself. The integrity of the natural world has been under attack for centuries. It was only the tools of the Industrial Age that gave us the instruments to finally roll back the edge of the wild. Yet at the doorstep of technological and social progress arrived a demon of our own making: Climate Change. Climate Change, the fruit of our pouring of pollutants into the air, is now posing a direct threat to human vitality. The essence of our species, and our ability to adapt and persevere in an ever-changing world, are directly threatened by global climate change. We are living with climate change, whether we like it or not. The history of humanity is so rooted to the planet, in its relationship to the soil and the land, that its current detachment from the natural world risks the very survival of our species. Our pure ignorance of the natural processes of the planet and the ways in which healthy ecosystems interact undeniably makes us the most environmentally ignorant species on planet Earth. It threatens our ability to survive. If not even the kindness of our hearts can push us to action, certainly self-preservation should. Nation-states have means at their disposal that, unfortunately, ordinary citizens do not yet have. Countries and governments like the United States could, with a slice of the fervor that they apply to warfare, organize their societies into a coordinated battle against Global Climate Change. We could have used our insurmountable wealth to protect the Earth and to safeguard our shared future. And, yes, America has admittedly made small but consequential gains over the past eight years. Under President Obama, we have attended climate treaties in good faith. We sat down with our international neighbors in half-attempts to make the globe a cleaner place. But none of these things were ever enough. Instead, we are squandering that opportunity. America, the most powerful nation in world history, has instead leveraged its power towards the continued destruction of the planet for material gain. We still allow corporations to have indescribable control over the ecological health of the continents and the oceans. We have consistently placed material wealth over biological health. Yet this should not surprise anyone. As much as the United States was built on the foundations of slavery and the annihilation of indigenous peoples, it was similarly fueled by the systemic destruction of the natural world. The health of the native nations and the natural integrity of the wilderness went hand-in-hand. As the Cherokee, Injuns, and Seminoles fell, so too did the old-growth forests and the herds of bison that roamed the Dakota plains. Only with the heroic voices of conservationists and political activists were we able to save the last remaining specks of our once spectacular natural heritage. We are living in an age of colossal uncertainty. Yes, the rise of Donald Trump to the Presidency will undoubtedly hinder national environmental reforms. But our inability to accept the dangers of climate change, and to mitigate them effectively, go far beyond simple party labels. And now we are reaping what we have sown. In this vein, the future of both the America and the world look bleak. Maybe the best that we can expect is piecemeal change, lurching onto climate change like a tortoise towards the finish line. The worst that we can anticipate is another American History, one in which a new Manifest Destiny is called in to plunder the last remaining wilderness. In the void that the nation-state has left with their inability to save the planet, the activist must step in. The activist must make progress where the nation cannot. No one in good faith can proclaim that. It seems, in reality, that Standing Rock is merely another instance of history stuck on loop. It merely rhymes. We hear the old chants and songs of the past; the same yells of tribes that fought for the land of yore while an impatient America ignored their pleas. But we hear them from new faces with young dreams. And this new generation of activists and leaders is poised to write its own history. The protestors at Standing Rock are loudly demanding a different future. They are standing and praying in the bitter cold, diligently defying a system that has ignored both the Earth and her indigenous peoples for centuries. Standing Rock is American history. It is human history. This is the peaceful yet strong rebuke of a political culture that, when analyzing the citizens of this nation, never consider the first peoples. Standing Rock is a legion of people not taking their world for granted. We are still a culture that eats from the table without ever considering where the food grew. We are still a people that write about saving nature on tree-pulp. Humanity is still, and may always be, an experiment in selective hypocrisy, one in which we care for the health of people but not for the planet that gives us life. But in the words of the protestors, and their valiant actions through adversity and opposition, I see hope. The people of Standing Rock are signaling, both to America and to the entire world, that there is still something on this planet worth fighting for. We have a moral obligation, both as Americans and citizens of the world, to constantly grow and work to right the wrongs of our past. Here we have an opportunity. Here, because of the hope that rises off of the protestors like steam in the cold, we have ledges of potential to grab onto. We can make our grand dreams of human equality, and an ecological balance between humans and the planet, a reality. And it begins there, in the frigid December air of North Dakota.

All of us need to parse perceived from actual reality every day, in nearly every aspect of our lives. In contrast, someone who voices a mistaken claim without any intent to deceive is not lying. That person may simply be unaware of the facts, or may refuse to believe the best available evidence. Some people who voice falsehoods appear incapable of distinguishing real from unreal, or truth from fiction, yet are sincerely convinced their worldview is absolutely correct. And this is our entree into the psychiatric literature. In clinical psychiatry, we see patients with a broad spectrum of ideas that many people would find eccentric, exaggerated or blatantly at odds with reality. Sometimes, clinicians can be wildly mistaken in their first impressions. A colleague of mine once described a severely agitated patient who was hospitalized because he insisted he was being stalked and harassed by the FBI. A few days into his hospitalization, FBI agents showed up on the unit to arrest the patient. Talking image via www.shutterstock.com. When what you believe is wrong We can think of distortions of reality as falling along a continuum, ranging from mild to severe, based on how rigidly the belief is held and how impervious it is to factual information. On the milder end, we have what psychiatrists call over-valued ideas. On the severe end of the continuum are delusions. These are strongly held, completely inflexible beliefs that are not altered at all by factual information, and which are clearly false or impossible. A patient who inflexibly believes that Vladimir Putin has personally implanted an electrode in his brain in order to control his thoughts would qualify as delusional. When the patient expresses this belief, he or she is not lying or trying to deceive the listener. It is a sincerely held belief, but still a falsehood. Within the range of normal falsehood are so-called false memories, which many of us experience quite often. For example, you are absolutely certain you sent that check to the power company, but in fact, you never did. A much more serious type of false memory involves a process called confabulation: the spontaneous production of false memories, often of a very detailed nature. Some confabulated memories are mundane; others, quite bizarre. Or, the person may insist she was abducted by terrorists and present a fairly elaborate account of the (fictional) ordeal. Confabulation is usually seen in the context of severe brain damage, such as may follow a stroke or the rupture of a blood vessel in the brain. Lying as a default Finally, there is falsification that many people would call pathological lying, and which goes by the extravagant scientific name of pseudologia fantastica (PF). Writing in the Psychiatric Annals, Drs. Rama Rao Gogeneni and Thomas Newmark list the following features of PF: A marked tendency to lie, often as a defensive attempt to avoid consequences. The lies are quite dazzling or fantastical, though they may contain truthful elements. Often, the lies may capture considerable public attention. The lies tend to present the person in a positive light, and may be an expression of an underlying character trait, such as pathological narcissism. Christian Bucad, CC BY-NC-ND Even more worrisome, the general public seems to have an appetite for falsehood. And when this magical transformation of reality occurs, whether in a political or scientific context, it becomes very difficult to reverse. Psychiatrists are not in a position to comment on the mental health of public figures they have not personally evaluated or on the nature of falsehoods sometimes voiced by our political leaders. Nevertheless, psychiatrists are keenly aware of the all-too-human need to avoid or distort unpleasant truths.

Before I start popping champagne and everyone rolls up their sleeping bags, I have a few more questions. We don't need forty-eight days. We need change that will last 48 years, and beyond that. That might be one way to prevent this from happening again. I ask if the president could please finalize this before he leaves office to prevent that from happening. The president must make a stand for the people of Standing Rock, immediately. In a permanent way, one that is substantial and provides permanent protection and legislation. He must speak up. He must show up. He must for the people who are out there in subzero temperatures fighting to keep our water clean and protect sacred earth; for all Americans who value clean drinking water, not only for themselves, but for their children. His silence has been deafening. On Thanksgiving Day, while our brave citizens, most of whom are Native Americans, were being shot in the face with rubber bullets, pepper sprayed, beaten and arrested for peaceful prayer and protest, the president smiled for cameras and pardoned two turkeys. And he hosted the White House Christmas party earlier this month, with his beautiful family, which would be really heartwarming if we didn't know what was happening on the other side of the country. Now he has finally spoken up, but he needs to finish the job. I do. So do the parents whose children drank poisoned water. I think it's a pretty good idea to try to have stuff like that not keep happening. I believed once that perhaps moving some oil around in the United States might be better than the sinister relationship we have with the Middle East. Corporations will always put profits before people, and so we look to the president to stand for us, because our policymakers simply have not. This pipeline will not serve the public interest, yet we will suffer the consequences and pay the price for generations to come as our water is compromised. In 2008, I stood up for Obama. I stood out in the freezing rain in New York, seven months pregnant, for eight hours at a time, asking people on the streets to vote for him. I drove to Pennsylvania while I was nursing a newborn, to knock on doors asking people to vote for him. I was a maxed-out donor. I made videos asking people to vote for him while my little brother served in Iraq. Right now, the president has, at last, offered us some hope. But this needs to be a permanent solution. If the president does not finish the job, I can assure you that people will remember. I hope that our president-elect has been paying attention to all of this, and hope that he does not underestimate the people's will to resist.

As with many confrontations nowadays, peaceful or otherwise, police have been arriving on the scene equipped with riot gear. As the tribe member in the video states, this includes rubber bullets, tear gas, batons, and weapons. Understandably, tribe members and fellow protesters have been keeping their distance. This, however, did not stop them from hollering in joy at the sight of thousands of wild buffalo making their way towards their protest. Alsup knew he needed something bigger, so he bought a school bus and immediately drove to Texas to fill it with pets for the first time.

Fire is everywhere along the Alabama pipeline. Destroying the natural flora and fauna around it. SAD. SO Water Protectors are calling on EVERYONE to check-in at Standing Rock, ND to overwhelm and confuse them. This is concrete action that can protect people putting their bodies and well-beings on the line that we can do without leaving our homes.

That bill, which would reduce or eliminate the penalties for drivers who struck and killed protesters who are blocking the roadway, has gotten some national attention, not all of it positive. I thought it was somewhat odd that Kempenich introduced the bill. He has, after all, voted yes on eight different proposals that would criminalize or restrict access to abortion in the past 10 years, and in 2014 was congratulated as a pro-life legislator by North Dakota Right to Life. I would think being pro-life would extend to adults, but I completely understand how enraging traffic tie-ups can be. People come from all over the country to take part in our outdoor activities. Rather than thinking about the Dakota Access pipeline protests as a negative, like Kempenich and others seem to, we could turn it into a positive. That way the state could issue protester licenses, the same as they do for deer. It might prove even more popular if the state limited the number of available licenses. In 2016 there were only eight bighorn sheep licenses available for more than 10,000 applicants. It could be a marketing boon, as well. I, for one, would love to be able to run down someone who is driving 10 miles an hour below the speed limit when I really, really, really need to get somewhere. I am positive there are other high crimes and misdemeanors that deserve to be added to my list. It might make sense to put the measure on the 2018 ballot with some options, so the people can decide which offenses should be punishable by being run over. And if it were a case of driver negligence, then prosecutors would look at the entire circumstances when deciding whether to press charges. This can be removed when origin is fixed.

It reads as follows: Dear President Obama, Army Corps of Engineers, and Department of Justice, We are writing to express our shock at the treatment of the people of Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. We are deeply disturbed by the police actions that have been taking place, where non violent protests have been and continue to be met with extremely aggressive tactics including; being shot with water canons in below freezing temperatures, chemical weapons, rubber bullets, and attack dogs. These are the same inhumane methods used during WWII and the Civil Rights Movement. We feel strongly in the current political climate that those in power must be held accountable for their actions. We encourage you to remember that this planet provides for us, not the other way around. Water is life and this cannot be underestimated or taken for granted in 2016. We are aware of the long and painful history between the US and its indigenous people. Standing Rock we stand with you. The Army Corps of Engineers have set a Dec. 5 deadline for protestors to decamp from the site, with those remaining expected to be charged with trespassing and facing prosecution. In recent weeks, the peaceful protestors have reportedly been threatened with the use of water cannons, rubber bullets and concussion grenades. Lamb of God 's Randy Blythe recently visited the Standing Rock protestors and wrote a detailed account of his experience that can be read here .

It really breaks my heart. Monet explains despite the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), which mandates law enforcement nationwide to lend assistance during emergencies or disasters, Governor Steve Bullock had concerns the agreement was being misused. I have been in protest situations in my career and fully understand that in many cases law enforcement is placed in the middle of two emotional opposing interests and we have to attempt to balance our role as peace officer and law enforcement. Many of you emailed and called the Office to voice your concerns. As your Sheriff I was very humbled by the honest conversations we had. One of the biggest differences of an elected Sheriff from other law enforcement leaders is that I am directly accountable to the people I serve (YOU) and although I am personally torn knowing that people (Including Montanans) are hurting over there, we will not be responding. Finally I am incredibly grateful that we live in a place where we can have differences and talk about them respectfully as adults without conflict. Gootkin and the Gallatin County deputies never made it to North Dakota, but other departments briefly assisted the Morton County Sheriff, and then refused to complete planned rotations, pulled out, and never returned. However, water protectors and independent journalists on the scene contend law enforcement brutalized water protectors, disrespectfully disassembled tipis, and refused to allow anyone to gather their belongings. Some claimed when they returned to the scene much later, officers had carelessly thrown tents, clothing, and other items in a pile, leaving all of it damaged and soaked in what seemed to be ammonia and urine. In short, public pressure can be surprisingly effective. Some have since returned from those deployments while others may still be present in North Dakota. Considering the success of public outcry in forcing law enforcement to reconsider policing the Standing Rock movement to protect the water, following is the contact information from the websites for the appropriate North Dakota officials and law enforcement departments from all states, as listed by the ACLU.

BRONTE WITTPENN, Gazette Staff Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Cory Bryson, 32, has known about the Dakota Access Pipeline since 2013. He attended public hearings in 2014, when he spoke with landowners, residents, legal staff and representatives of Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company building the pipeline. Bryson has worked on projects of this size before. To Bryson, this was just another ordinary project. Three years later, Bryson told a different story. Bryson knows the pipeline industry, he's worked in it since he was 23, and his father was a pipeliner for 32 years. Born and raised in Mandan, N.D. Bryson continues to live there with his wife and three kids. He represents workers across all industries and labor unions. He enforces contracts and looks out for the safety of workers. The pipeline stretches through about 375 miles of farmland starting in Stanley, N.D., to outside the northern border of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. He makes sure they are treated fairly and that work is carried out properly. Together both men represent 750 laborers from Minnesota and North Dakota working on the pipeline. Bryson said he remembers the first protest. It was in early July. About 200 people gathered on Highway 1806. Local police showed up, not in riot gear. There was no aggression, he said, but police were mingled with protesters. Some even shook hands. And workers were thrown into the middle of it. The amount of money lost for workers due to halting parts of pipeline construction is well into six digits, he said. For some, workweeks went from 85 hours to as few as 24. Some people have left the project, and part of Dekrey's job has been trying to get people to stay. BRONTE WITTPENN, Gazette staff A lot of the violence is coming from people who are from out of state bringing their own agendas, Bryson said. Too many groups are involved, he said. However, the people who live in Standing Rock have to stay, and the two communities will have to fix their relationship. Drill pads are built and secured. This step is by far the most contentious between the two sides.

The vigil offered a time to reflect on the more than 450 Tolowa killed in 1853 by white settlers pushing into the area, but it's also a time to give thanks to the surviving ancestors who kept the Tolowa people in existence. Under a star-soaked sky, with the sound of waves crashing in the background, almost 50 people gathered around a bonfire, electric candles in hand, to remember the Tolowa people that lived at Yontocket. Tribal council member and resident historian Loren Bommelyn told the tale of the Tolowa massacre and the Tolowa's relationship with Yontocket, located within present-day Tolowa Dunes State Park, a place the Tolowa believe to be the center of their spiritual world. The Tolowa believe that Yontocket is the site where the Creators made the first redwood and the first people. For thousands of years, the Tolowa Indians on the North Coast, numbering at least 10,000 people, gathered annually at the Yontocket village to celebrate Nee-dash, a world renewal ceremony, Bommelyn said. The 10-day ceremony is held during winter solstice, because that's when days start growing longer, Bommelyn said. Tolowa people would come from as far as present-day Humboldt Bay and Port Orford for the ceremony, Bommelyn said. During the Nee-dash festival of 1853, white settlers set fire to the plank homes of Yontocket, then shot at the Tolowa while they ran from the flames, Bommelyn said. The state would reimburse militia men for every Indian scalp they brought back. Smith River Rancheria has 11 receipts showing reimbursement for Indian scalps, Bommelyn said. The Smith River Rancheria and some other anthropologists have declared the destruction of native populations in this region a holocaust because it was organized under a government, Bommelyn said. After the Yontocket massacre and destruction of the village, the Tolowa founded a new village between present-day Lake Earl and Lake Tolowa called Etchulet, meaning large land peninsula. The 1854 Nee-dash ceremony was held there, but once again white settlers came for Indian scalps, this time killing around 100 people, Bommelyn said. From 1851 to 1856, around 8,000 Tolowa people were killed, then another 1,834 were marched to a reservation, which was more like a concentration camp, in Oregon, Bommelyn said. The few hundred that remained were eventually sent to reservations at present-day Klamath and Hoopa Valley Indian Reservation, Bommelyn said. The vigil honoring the Yontocket victims and survivors was started to help the tribe overcome feelings about the slaughter. Bommelyn and others shared the pain of knowing about the massacre and the marginalization experienced from growing up Indian - all part of the healing process. After the vigil at Yontocket, attendants met at the Lake Earl Grange to share a meal, stories and watch a documentary made in the 1970s about the Tolowa people. The tribe expressed optimism about the shift towards acknowledging their ancestors' past, and hopes to continue to spread knowledge of the massacre."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/249452874t?referring_akid=.1607266.io5v6k", "Timestamp": "20180918232850", "Sentences": "Credo Action Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument.

Hillary Clinton 's well-heeled backers have opened a new frontier in digital campaigning, one that seems to have been inspired by some of the Internet's worst instincts. Others, however, say Clinton has little choice but to try, given the ubiquity of online assaults and the difficulty of squelching even provably untrue narratives once they have taken hold. The task force designed to stop the spread of online misinformation and misogyny is the brainchild of David Brock, a Clinton confidant who once made a career of spreading such misinformation and misogynistic attacks against her and Bill Clinton. The mere mention of Correct the Record makes some critics seethe. Super PACs are typically prohibited from working in tandem with candidates, but Correct the Record is doing just that by exploiting a loophole in campaign finance law that it says permits such coordination with digital campaigns. The email also emphasized that Correct the Record is spending the million dollars in a way that it argues is legal under rules governing super PACs. When actor Tim Robbins was confronted on Twitter after making the dubious assertion that election fraud is robbing Sanders of votes, he accused tweeters who challenged him of being paid shills for Brock. Your check is in the mail. Correct the Record is not paying activists outside the organization to send messages, although it is arming them with instructions, talking points and postable infographics. But the Robbins response confirmed a well-established rule of social media: The kind of confrontations Correct the Record is manufacturing almost never win converts. Social media scholars say that's not necessarily a problem. Campaigns are grappling with the reality that there is no proven strategy for stopping the spread of even demonstrably false attacks on social media, he said. The campaign has been given credit by Sanders loyalists, however, for all manner of things that it has had nothing to do with, including posting pornography on pro-Sanders Facebook pages which resulted in them being temporarily taken down. (The pages went down as a result of a Facebook software glitch). They're also getting ready for battle against Trump, he said. That may be true, but the effort seems unlikely to be a game changer for Clinton's campaign, said Dan Gillmor, who teaches media literacy at Arizona State University.

Dec 1, 2016 The Journey With Standing Rock. Jerry Spirit Hawk Brown. Photo credit: Hector Cruz Photography. Jerry is an Apache. One of four Founding Fathers of the South East American Indian Council. Jerry is a Veteran, who took a bullet to the chest in Vietnam, costing him one of his lungs. Today, he stands near Lake Oahe, to join the thousands who are joining in solidarity at the Standing Rock Reservation. The protests at Standing Rock have gained international attention after questions arose regarding the role of law enforcement against those protesting. The following is a living account of the journey taken 1300 miles across five states by Jerry Spirit Hawk Brown, Stephanie Tallent and photographer, Hector Cruz, who agreed to have their story shared here with interviews, images and live updates. We all have a responsibility to this earth and to the human race. That spirit brings us together in times of despair and times of joy. This is one of those times that I hope we can look deep within ourselves and find that fighting united spirit that makes us human and compassionate. This affects us all TODAY. This will affect our children and grandchildren. We owe this beautiful earth a lot better than the way we have treated it. We have a 16 foot trailer full of supplies. The local community started donating and we even saw people coming from two hours away to be sure our trailer was full. People were donating necessities and hand made art and any cash they could spare to help us help others. It was an outpouring of community effort. Then, we stopped along the way to get even more. There are threats we will be turned away or fined and we pressed on. If we get fined, so be it. Supplies are needed. And we hope others will help provide. Hector Cruz just outside Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Pictured with supply trailer. My feelings are all over the place but my passion and determination has not changed. This is Lake Oahe.

Cell Phone Footage Courtesy Hector Cruz Photography. The Human Spirit is warm and inviting however. The resolve, compassion, determination, and commitment of the people here is invigorating and inspiring. The women here are strong and have left me in awe of their strength. The elders, the children, the vets, are all united and that my friends is the Human spirit. Hundreds of people are here. All busy and working or praying or meeting in all elements of the huge camp life. Met two veterans last night that quit their jobs and plan on staying here as long as necessary. Later every random person we crossed paths with. The warmth and friendliness of the people here is amazing. Heavy tarps, mattresses, herbs, essential oils, supplements, kids clothes, heavy winter coats, blankets, cups, first aid supplies, cedar and sage etc. We sort and organize and then delivered to tents based on the category. Hector Cruz pauses to take in the view as unloading of donations begins. Photo Courtesy: Stephanie Tallent There are different kitchens here and communal sleeping areas. There is legal staff here also. You can sense a feeling of panic among some organizers. They realize once the veterans leave the governor will come in. 2:00PM EST: Media converging on campgrounds to prepare for Veterans Stephanie, Hector and Jerry pack up the tent to move from this location. Supplies all unloaded as they now travel through more of the grounds. Photo Courtesy: Hector Cruz Photography 5:00PM EST: Weather making conditions harder for those on site: We just got in a really bad accident. Will keep you all posted. We are in shock and glad to be alive. They are staying tonight in a hotel near the grounds while they await decisions on repairs for truck and trailer.

Stephanie Tallent After tight security was placed on media entertaining the grounds, it was uncertain how many photographers and journalists would be granted access. Jerry is a little better and resting. At historic moment on blockaded bridge on hwy 1806 with veterans and medics. Her office had announced on November 14, 2016 that it was delaying the decision on the easement to allow for discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation lies 0.5 miles south of the proposed crossing. Tribal officials have expressed repeated concerns over the risk that a pipeline rupture or spill could pose to its water supply and treaty rights. Surreal. My brain heart and emotions are still trying to process everything we saw. Best part of the day was getting to tell Jerry the good news. I am terrified of NOT LIVING. You see I cared about this cause but a big part of me did not want to come. I did not want to be uncomfortable, but even more so I did not want to make myself vulnerable again. You see, when you photograph someone there is a connection that is made and a vulnerability must occur to be able to capture the spirit of the person. I am thankful that this has inspired me once again to continue the work that I do with my camera in support of social issues. Photo Courtesy: Hector Cruz Photography I had a chance to talk with Hector about the events he witnessed as the Army Corps decision came down. He described it as tense and determined. He told me that many of the veterans were not convinced that the decision would be honored. He also said it appeared there were now more veterans on site than Lakota. Hector witnessed veterans wanting to claim the land to stand as a front line for the peaceful protesters as the tribes pulled them back into the celebration not wanting any sort of tactical advantage scenario that might escalate away from the peaceful resistance happening. Hector described it as a bit of a power struggle, where you could feel the tension. Hector said the tribal members deescalated the situation at the blockade yesterday. I was standing right there. I saw them. You can see the grenade pins right there at the blockade. Hector said he also received reports that on a back dirt road, that had not previously been barricaded was now blocked off. Hector said about one mile from that road, camps are being set up by what appeared to be military or armed guards. On the evening of December 5th, a Forgiveness Ceremony was held in solidarity between veterans and natives of Turtle Island. Photo Courtesy: Hector Cruz Photography December 6, 2015 10:00AM EST: Stranded But Safe Hector and his crew remain near to the grounds with Jerry. Blizzards have closed the roads and they have no access currently to get back into the camp grounds. Stephanie asked that all coming to the camp and those traveling through the small towns near remember the community that is here and to not take advantage of the hospitality on the camp and the small business needs in those towns nearby. She said contrary to what she was led to expect, she has seen great support from those in smaller communities they have visited near the grounds. I just want to remind everyone to respect culture and community and that if they are coming through as a water protector or protester they will represent all water protectors and protesters. Wind gusts combined with icy roads in the town we are in with our trailer makes it extremely dangerous for us to try to head out. We might have taken our chances to get out if it were just a few miles but the entire state is covered with winds like that. We have and continue to explore every option for weighing down the trailer. Boxes with rocks, bags of cement, containers of water etc. We are two hours drive from the nearest big store which makes figuring out that kind of thing a little more complicated. then the people have lost their voice. No one hears the peoples voice, no one cares that the almighty dollar is more important than the wishes of the people. This is the fight for the land. This is democracy or democracy has failed. I love my country. I love my people. I even love my enemies. If this pipeline goes through, we have lost our voice in America. I am sad. I hurt for all the people younger than me. I hurt for my children and your children, my grandchildren and your grandchildren. Packing last of stuff. Leaving trailer because there is no way to safely tow it in these conditions. Our window to leave is now or he may wind up hospitalized if we stay here another week waiting for weather to clear. Trusting a local stranger with the care of the trailer until pickup arrangements can be made. Jerry wants to continue traveling home, but an agreement is made that they will stop in Pierre to check on his temperature and vitals and decide at that point whether or not to find a hospital near town. Hector shared his thoughts as they settled in and kept Jerry comfortable. Resting now. You know as we steadily get closer to home you start to realize the impact of what is going on at Standing Rock. I have been feeling some anxiety and sadness, but I am definitely still processing those emotions, they are pretty overwhelming at this moment. I knew that I wanted to go, as I felt strongly about this but there was a big part of me that felt I had no place going. I wanted to humanize the cause, give the Water Protectors names and faces. It is easy to ignore a cause, but it is not easy to ignore a face. I need a day, time, to process and really think about this because I am not the same man, and I have changed in some meaningful ways. This was a life changer.

Speaking from the BBC studio in London where he hosts the weekly radio program Inside Science, Rutherford explains how the development of farming changed human biology; why the most important story our genes tell is that we are all family, despite race or tribe; and why it's not genes that turn people into mass shooters. If you think of DNA simply as a data storage device, the data it stores is biological information. Under the right conditions, DNA will last for thousands or even hundreds of thousands of years trapped inside the bones of a person or organism. With the advent of our ability to get it out, we can do genome studies on creatures that have been dead for thousands of centuries. The first big landmark came in 2009, when DNA was extracted from the bone of a Neanderthal. Europeans on average have between one and two percent Neanderthal DNA. Using sophisticated statistics and computer models, we can also pinpoint when that DNA went from Neanderthal to humans and vice versa. Learn how the species fits into our evolutionary story. We saw that we interbred with the Denisovans, and they interbred with us. The further east you go today, the more Denisovan DNA you see in living people and the less Neanderthal. Another exciting discovery is how our genes change culture, and vice-versa. Even before we were Homo sapiens, we were using technology like fire to cook with or tools like stones. That developed in our species what we broadly refer to as culture, which includes art and music but also agriculture. The emergence of farming as our dominant technology 10-12,000 years ago fundamentally changed human behavior and our own biology. The best-understood example of that is what is referred to as lactase persistence. They get gassy tummy and diarrhea as a result of drinking milk after they have weaned. Looking at the genetics of ancient people, we know that we had, in fact, started dairy farming before lactase persistence evolved, rather than the other way around. We were already using goats and sheep for their dairy products before we had the ability to drink raw milk into adulthood. Fast forward millennia to the recent riots in Charlottesville, which showed how volatile the issue of race still is in America. In many ways, genetics makes a mockery of race. But when we look at the full genomes from people all over the world, those differences represent a tiny fraction of the differences between people. There is, for instance, more genetic diversity within Africa than in the rest of the world put together. You had your own DNA analyzed. The data refers to a proportion of people in a population who have that characteristic. In 2012, geneticists were asked to analyze the DNA of mass-shooter Adam Lanza for clues to his violence. It says something about us that we look for simple answers to complex questions. Inevitably, people have turned to the relatively new science of genetics to try to explain otherwise unfathomable human behaviors, such as spree killing or murder. But the notion that there would be a deterministic, genetic component to someone who went out and shot 20 kids in a school, as Adam Lanza did, is incredibly misguided. There is a genetic basis to human behaviors. But there is also an environmental component. We used to say nature versus nurture. But we might say nature via nurture. Almost all spree killers display similar characteristics of profound psychological problems, and Adam Lanza was typical in that regard. Some of those problems have a heritable component. The single common factor in all spree killings is access to guns. That seems straightforward to me. In that sense, we are changing. That is a much more difficult question to answer, partly because evolution happens slowly. Adaptation to different environmental pressures happens generally very slowly, over many, many generations. This is effectively a history book. Our new ability to get DNA out of the long dead has made geneticists like me historians, with this new source text that is complementary to all the traditional forms of knowing the past. Every week a paper comes out that makes me catch my breath and also makes me sigh because it means I have to rewrite the book. And will probably be rewriting it for many years to come.

The Standing Rock Sioux tribe, located in North Dakota, with support from tribes across the country, are protesting the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline across their land. The construction of this pipeline threatens burial grounds and the tribe's water source, itself considered sacred to the Sioux. We can be activist storytellers. We can amplify THIS voice, and we can make a difference, together. The best things in life; we don't ask for. These are the lucky things, like having a little sister who looks up to you so much that she keeps every single Barbie Doll you ever bought for her in the box; some of which remain unopened after 20 years. Luckier still if this little girl, grows up with the name you gave her your freshman year in college; and when SHE is 18, still thinks you walk on water. My little sister, Kayden, my confidant, my sidekick, and my teacher in life; had a beautiful son right before the New Year 2016; and I was so lucky to be his aunt. My profile picture is of my little nephew and I in late June or early July, 2016. The worst things in life; we don't ask for. My sister and my 6 month old nephew were tragically killed in a car accident; an all too common occurrence for young people on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation in South Dakota; but an inconceivable one for a mother and a child. Only 23 years old, she and my nephew, along with 5 other passengers, were broadsided on a poorly maintained road in one of our smaller communities. 5 of the 7 were killed. Every person on our Reservation was affected; and everyone in our lives were devastated. Mother and son were buried together. In my grief, I was feeling quite sorry for myself. I was thinking only of myself and my hurt; until mid-August. Then, just a month after this tragedy, I found a light. Battles which are bigger than ourselves; battles that cause us to put our lives and emotions on hold and find a way to fight for a greater good. In August, my Tribe answered a call put out by the people of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, one of our original 7 historically, culturally, and linguistically connected Tribes (The Oceti Sakowin); a call to join them to fight the greatest battle known to any of our Tribes for the past decade; a call to fight for the preservation of the earth (Unci Maka) and clean water (Mni Wiconi). I answered that call for Kayden. It started with a simple plan to go and help deliver some supplies in a borrowed pickup with friends. We did this. In this great time of questioning; with Obama going out, with the lack of fruition that I could see in his promise of past to help the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe; I could see and still see with my own eyes; how he has not followed through with his promise. Despite our defenses being little more than lids from plastic tubs, these people, of all walks of life, have been putting their lives on the line to protect the Cannonball River from pollution and contamination. In the last large demonstration nearly a week ago, my friends were seriously injured by the police and hired Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) Security Agents via rubber bullets, tear gas grenades, and more. The greatest assault to all was to the women; with first-hand evidence via injury to women in the head, breasts, and other feminine areas. After that night, with some of my crew injured, I cried. I cried hard because in all my volunteerism in the past 3 months, there are quiet moments when I still just miss my sister. She would have been the first person that I would have called. She would have been the first to watch my children for me in all these days I have been away from home. She would have been the first person who went there by my side. I do many supply runs on my own. I drive many miles alone; but in those times, I know I am never alone. Even though this is a battle that is truly the test of all tests; and at times, seems so bleak; We STAND. And in the Trump environment, even if there are times when we all feel so, so small as Native people; We are trying to save ourselves. We are tolerating constant low-flying aircraft, and a real police-like state. I have a couple of little angels by my side; and this battle is bigger than any one of us; bigger than anything that we could ever do alone; and we are standing for what we believe in.

There was the spring of 2017, when he accused the German government of adopting Nazi methods. Or when he stayed silent after the Turkish press depicted German Chancellor Angela Merkel with a Hitler moustache. Government officials argue that everyone knows the Turks don't allow themselves to be intimidated like that. Ultimately, Trump will fail to secure the release of the imprisoned American pastor Andrew Brunson, they argue, and he will instead poison relations between Turkey and the West. Now, it's Trump of all people who is pushing Germany and Turkey back together. The looming collapse of the Turkish economy is a genuine dilemma for the German government. It doesn't want the Turkish economy to fall deeper into crisis, no matter what. They are worried about potential consequences for the eurozone and the German economy, about the 3 million Turks living in Germany and about the possible unraveling of the deal with Ankara that is preventing more refugees from making their way to Europe. If it becomes necessary to act, officials in the German government argue, Germany will be at the front of the line.

Hardly anything would be less popular among the Germans than sending taxpayers' money to the autocrat in Ankara. When Andrea Nahles, the head of the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), raised the possibility of German aid for Turkey, it was followed by a prompt denial from the government. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz of the SPD also had little enthusiasm for the idea. The fact of the matter is that many in Berlin believe Nahle's suggestion was premature, but not fundamentally incorrect. Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert also didn't broadly exclude the possibility of aid for Turkey. But if they don't suffice, it seems clear that Berlin won't simply sit back and watch. For now, German aid to Turkey has been restricted to rhetorical assistance. German politicians are outdoing one another in stressing Turkey's immense importance as a partner for Germany and Europe. FAQ: Everything You Need to Know about DER SPIEGEL Seven Decades of Quality Journalism: The History of DER SPIEGEL Reprints: How To License SPIEGEL Articles In Ankara, the government happily took note of Berlin's fawning words, which noticeably calmed the markets. A Softer Tack At the same time, the German government set in motion an unprecedented round of phone calls and visits. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz demonstratively invited his Turkish counterpart and Erdogan's son-in-law Berat Albayrak to Berlin. Even before President Erdogan embarks on his visit with full military honors to Berlin in four weeks, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas (SPD) will travel to Ankara. Economics Minister Peter Altmaier (CDU) is planning a visit to Turkey a few weeks later. DER SPIEGEL The German government wants the softer new approach to Turkey to send a message -- to Donald Trump and the markets. But for Merkel, any German support for Erdogan puts her in an awkward position. Since the refugee deal, the chancellor has been accused of having allowed herself to be blackmailed by Erdogan. When she visited the Turkish president during her election campaign, widespread criticism followed. It doesn't help the chancellor that voters with Merkel's CDU are particularly critical of Erdogan. This makes Turkey even more satisfied with Merkel's handling of the crisis. Erdogan's adviser says the president feels validated in his assumption that, when in doubt, the Germans won't leave the Turks hanging. He is convinced that, given the millions of Syrian refugees his country has taken in, he can place pressure on Germany. At the same time, Erdogan doesn't want to portray himself as a supplicant, making it unlikely he will publicly ask the German government for any financial aid. The symbolic support from Germany is, for now at least, more important to the Turkish leader. Government experts believe financial aid for Ankara is theoretically possible, but not bilaterally and without conditions. The line right now goes that direct financial aid cannot and will not happen. In the Finance Ministry, officials are also saying that the European safety net, the European Stability Mechanism, cannot be used to help the country because Turkey isn't a member of the eurozone. In the coming talks with his Turkish counterpart Albayrak, Scholz wants to urge Turkey to seek assistance from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). People in the ministry argue this is the normal channel for dealing with the kinds of turbulence Turkey is currently experiencing. Psychological Factors People close to Erdogan are excluding the possibility that the president will ask the IMF for a bailout. Erdogan has repeatedly boasted of having revived the economy after the dire 2001 crisis and of making Turkey independent from the West. If he asks for help from the IMF as his predecessor did, it would be tantamount to an admission of failure. That's why officials in Berlin are looking for other ways to help the Turkish economy. Finance Minister Scholz, for example, could imagine the Europeans adopting joint measures to spur investment in Turkey. Plenty of opportunities exist, especially in the tourism sector. The summer 2017 decision to limit the state guarantees for exports to Turkey has been lifted, and the Foreign Ministry also recently downgraded warnings for people traveling to Turkey. The German government has also requested that the Turkish government convene a meeting of the German-Turkish Economic Commission, which was founded in 2013 but has never held a meeting. Since economics is half psychology, the German government wants to do everything in its power to calm the financial markets. It is worried the stability of the eurozone might once again be jeopardized as a result of the Turkish economic crisis. For German banks, the lira's weakness doesn't pose a huge risk because they only have about 21 billion euros in outstanding loans to Turkish companies. But it is dangerous for Spanish financial institutions, which have lent 69 billion euros. The first euro crisis was caused by, among other things, bankrupt banks with bad loans on their books. But the German government also wants something back in return for its support. It has communicated to Ankara in various ways that the seven Germans still being held in Turkey for political reasons, partly without charges, must be freed. The lifting of the ban on Turkish-German journalist Mesale Tolu leaving Turkey on Monday is being viewed as an early sign of compromise by the German government, and as an indication that further decisions in this vein can be expected in the near future. If that happens, German government sources say, it is also feasible that Germany would stop blocking negotiations in the EU for a customs union with Turkey. It remains questionable whether Erdogan will be willing to make concessions under pressure. The president suspects that his power will erode if the economic situation further deteriorates. But he still doesn't have the will to raise interest rates or to reduce state expenditures, as most economists are suggesting. Erdogan wants to be able to boast of growth numbers in the regional elections in early 2019, and is blocking any reform that might curb growth for this reason. He believes he can sit out the crisis. His people also make it clear that Erdogan will not back down in a fight with Trump. As such, the Turkish government is lining up allies in Europe and Asia with the goal of isolating Trump in the conflict. In this respect, Germany holds special importance for Turkey, and Erdogan is demonstratively seeking to close ranks with the German government. As a first step, he has instructed all his ministers to dial down their verbal attacks against Germany. Finance Minister Scholz also believes the newfound proximity to Turkey is necessary for geopolitical reasons. He believes the Europeans need to show President Trump that they will not allow the U.S. to create disruptions in their own backyard without a fight. Jetzt aufrufen.

Since the beginning of time, man has coexisted with nature. He has connected to Earth and everything in it with a deep and profound reverence. We have lived, survived and flourished from the plants, animals and the rivers that flow through it. Everything we know has come from this planet. Due to colonial imperialism and colonization, that realization has been lost over the generations. We no longer depend on Mother Nature herself, but the exploitation of her resources. The conflict between Energy Transfer Partners and Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota embodies a dynamic battle for a better world where we can stand up to greedy corporations and marauding entities. We can replenish and nurture an Earth so badly exploited and stand up for the social injustices of the oppressed. The domestically produced crude oil Dakota Access Pipeline construction has broken the 1851 treaty with the reservation and has destroyed many sacred burial grounds. The pipeline, also known as The Black Snake is also scheduled to cross under the Missouri River and potentially threaten the water supply to the tribes and thousands of other Mid-Western residents. I served 5 years in the United States Army, two tours in Iraq and I took an oath to fight all enemies foreign and domestic. I stood on the front lines of history facing Riot Police, pepper spray, risking arrest, was almost ran over by DAPL workers driving full speed in a diesel truck at a peace line and stood toe to toe with those same workers swinging bats in intimidation like a baseball player walking up to the plate. Over the past few months, the battle at Standing Rock has intensified. Private Security from DAPL has released dogs on unarmed Water Protectors and the actions of the Police force has been excessive on peaceful protestors from mace, pepper spray, sound cannons, rubber bullets to water hoses being sprayed in below freezing weather. Being on the front lines at Standing Rock has been an emotional experience. I have seen the absolute worst in people but I have also experienced the best. It is a place filled with love and wholeness. From young Natives riding bareback, the vibrant and vivid sunsets setting behind a row of Teepees, the smell of sage and cedar, to the sounds of children playing, horses neighing and prayer chants echoing throughout the land, you know this is a sacred and special place. I have helped build and participated in sweat lodges, meditated at the sacred fire and have seen the powerful presence of Mother Earth as a Great Bald Eagle circled an intense standoff with Riot Police. During my time at Sacred Stone the son of President Kennedy, Robert Kennedy Jr., visited and spoke at the camp. He stated the strategy of the Oil Company is to get the pipeline into the ground and operating (even against the orders of the Army Corp of Engineer) so investors have an interest in maintaining oil as our major resource for the next 30 years. Right now, even against the orders of the Army Corp of Engineers, Energy Transfer Partners and DAPL workers are continuing construction. They are wrong and the lawsuit will not succeed. The truth is, I have seen with my own eyes and even stood in a peaceful protest against DAPL workers as they were laying down pipe, that the amount of money it will cost them in fines for continuing construction is nothing in comparison to what they lose if they continue to build. Even the locals have had enough of the protest. I can assure you the protests have been peaceful and nothing but prayer circles and ceremonies. The lack of media coverage has raised much concern and what little coverage major news outlets have covered have bent the truth to make the Water Protectors look like violent, arsonist criminals. We as a people just want our voice to be heard and have come together to make a stand for new, alternative resources, blocking fossil fuel infrastructures, safer and cleaner energy, the protection of water, and the social injustice against the Natives. It is being done for a better way of life for generations to come. It is compassion and reverence for all walks of life and the Earth that we all share together. The world is seeing a major shift and transition. The older generations of destruction, corporate greed and deceit are dying out but not without a fight. But they ARE dying out. I have faith in the new generations to come. Regardless of what happens with the Dakota Access Pipeline, I believe with all my heart that we have already won. The world is watching the way we treat one another, the Earth, our greed and how it is destroying the world and how unified people can come together peacefully for a noble, worthy cause. I have hope. What better way than to leave you with a quote from Sitting Bull. Strangely enough they have a mind to till the soil and the love of possession is a disease with them. These people have made many rules that the rich may break but the poor may not. They take their tithes from the poor and weak to support the rich and those who rule. They claim this mother of ours, the earth, for their own and fence their neighbors away; they deface her with their buildings and their refuse. The nation is like a spring freshet that overruns its banks and destroys all that are in its path. We cannot dwell side by side.

The pipeline will cross Standing Rock Sioux Tribal land and under the Missouri River, as well as eight other major waterways. Over the past few months, the Water Protectors have occupied the route of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) to prevent its construction. As the months have passed, the site has become increasingly militarized. On Sunday night, tensions boiled over and reports surfaced that the police used water cannons, rubber bullets, tear gas, and pepper bombs in below freezing temperatures on over 400 people protecting the land from the DAPL, injuring over 150 people. They told BUST that the risks they were about to take were minimal in comparison to what the people in North Dakota were sacrificing. They felt it was imperative to stand with indigenous rights and protect the environment.

Citibank, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, and Mizuho Bank are three other investors, according to Democracy Now. If TD Bank withdrew its assets as well, the project could dry up, and activists believe it will send a message that their business, which prides itself on supporting responsible energy development, is not going to fund a project that could destroy the environment and negatively impact indigenous people. There has been a call to action by indigenous women to put pressure on Energy Transfer Partners (the parent company of the Dakota Access Pipeline), where it will hurt most: their investors. Abigail Meinen, another participant, said in the release. They are the guardians of the water, the life-giving force of the Earth. The protestors felt they wanted to use their privilege as white women to make a stance with indigenous women, who have been on the front line from day one, and who have sacrificed such a tremendous amount in order to prevent DAPL. They shut down the bank for an hour and drew a crowd of more than 20 people. The Army Corps of Engineers, which is the federal agency that oversees the project, recently released a statement that more analysis and conversation with the Standing Rock Sioux Nation is needed in order to move forward with the pipeline. ETP fired back and said they are suing the government in order to complete DAPL. 6 women were arrested Monday morning, including the 3 women chained to the bank, 2 women holding the sign, and a sixth woman who was involved. This is part of a broader solidarity movement that has been occurring all over the country.

You see, the history of Muskrat and Site C are so very similar. Governments wanting a big legacy project. They stymied their provincial regulator and did not give them all the info they needed. So the good people of Newfoundland Labrador were screwed. Here in BC the government exempted the same review. No independent body has ever examined the info Hydro has concocted and some of it has already been shown to be inaccurate. But the massive geotechnical issues that have resulted in work being redone over and over again, are going to blow a hole in that. And who knows what will happen in the years to come. Research shows mega dam projects often increase in cost to nearly double. On a dam you have to try to find a customer for.. and that no one has verified info on. Having said that, it is unseemly. Like Mike Duffy and Pamela Martin. For years we got faces implying neutrality but who, in the end, showed their bias in the extreme. And, as Laila says, the TRUTH HAS NO AGENDA. Went media-for-money. And then morphed DEEP GREEN. One of a kind. In fact it should have been done 5 years ago. December 9, 2016 12:37 pm at 12:37 pm randyhadland BC Hydro and the BC Liberals have done more damage to the BC economy with their efforts to build Site C than they have done to the valley environment as of yet. To do as much damage as she has and still smile is beyond sick and sociopathic, it borders on sadistic. She is practically salivating. They are the turkeys just before Thanksgiving anticipating the holidays to come. They are right to do so. December 9, 2016 8:39 am at 8:39 am Hugh Using clean hydro power to run natural gas and LNG plants means that the natural gas that would normally power the plant can then be exported and burned, releasing GHGs. There is SO much negative about this project and this government that its difficult to know where to start. My heart goes out to the Boons, but I suppose their case could be worse. With any luck the slopes will sluff in and the project will be aborted. Bet the Fort St. John hoteliers are not to happy with THAT competition. Best of the season to you. BC has indeed killed a project after money has been invested. And it was an NDP government that did it. Makes me even more determined to help the Peace Valley landowners and First Nations in their fight to stop this abomination. December 10, 2016 3:36 pm at 3:36 pm Lew Three questions immediately come to mind with me after reading the Vancouver Sun and New York Times articles. December 10, 2016 4:18 pm at 4:18 pm JDC Ever so slightly off topic, Lew. Apologies. whose business it is to mess in elections believe that the US election was messed with by the Russians. Instead we got the Alex Fraser bridge closure. Maybe a snow depth measurement. Marvel Comix gets closer to the truth than does POSTMEDIA . December 10, 2016 5:32 pm at 5:32 pm Lew Yes. This in the face of extensive evidence and expert opinion that the project is not required, and is not in the public interest for many reasons. And the Vancouver Sun (and most other local media) serves up coverage of it that would result in a failing grade if submitted as a paper in the first term at any school of journalism. Send in the clowns. Even if Horgan says nothing about Site-C, it is still designed to be NDP-toxic. The NDP has to be very, very careful on this issue as a result. A trap is laid at virtually every approach, just as planned from the beginning. Christy will do everything to keep it sloganeering, punchy-one-liners. Christy is very rude and has no qualm about interrupting and drowning opponents out with superior volume during these televised opportunities. Here is one of the places to detail the perfidy of Site-C. And to list all that, take all day. December 10, 2016 5:52 pm at 5:52 pm nonconfidencevote Well, well well. The trouble with this entire construction project is the lack of a budgetting process. car if I cant tell them what the car will cost. Its a violation of every basic accounting principle that large corporations are legally OBLIGATED to follow and most hold dear. Unfortunately this Dam will take years to complete and Clark will probaly walk away at the 11th hour and wipe her hands of the entire fiscal mess. Jail is too good for these lying, theiving scum. If the NDP come to power they should stop it in its tracks and AUDIT EVERYTHING. She deigned to visit our community exactly twice in all that time and sat there smiling and asking what the community volunteers had done. She acted like our proud mom, not our champion.

December 17, 2016 8:04 pm at 8:04 pm Jdc Sorry, Astro. You are right. I tried to be too brief in my condemnation when only a tome would have a chance at describing their inadequacy. Mind you, it would take a small library to document the destructive evil manifest by the Liberals insatiable greed and corruption. Let me guess. Banishment forever is a likely result. Then let me make it easier for you. The current system as it stands is failing the voters. Hence the election of the lunatic fringe like Donald Trump. Voters are willing to try anything to shake up the status quo. Democracy is a joke, bought and paid for by special interests. But at least we get to toss out the ruling party every election unless the NDP squanders another election. We do not need the power, not even for LNG. It would not be enough anyway. December 18, 2016 1:27 pm at 1:27 pm John's Aghast JDC usually makes a lot of sense. Unfortunately, a lot this time. December 18, 2016 7:51 pm at 7:51 pm JDC You are partly right, Astro. My apologies. I was being too brief in my condemnation of the NDP where, really, a tome or multi-page indictment is required. One simply cannot write enough bad things regarding the opposition. They do such a poor job. The Liberals do evil and the NDP do nothing. I actually learn more from reading Laila. But thanks for the encouragement to keep on writing.

December 11, 2016 3:36 pm at 3:36 pm Astro Thank you for another excellent article. It is very informative. December 11, 2016 9:52 pm at 9:52 pm Laila Yuile It gets better. Like I said, this is going to make the Fast Ferries look like candy store change in your pocket. They may have to twin a temporary bridge thanks to so many traffic delays. This will be the biggest boondoggle ever. EVER. There is a good reason the BCUC turned this down twice already. Not a bit. I only visit this site once a day and it gets downright disheartening. I can only imagine what it would be like to dwell on this and other similar problems all day every day. I notice Norm Farrell has been absent for a couple of months. December 13, 2016 6:49 pm at 6:49 pm e.a.f. Nothing is beyond the point of no return except perhaps death and even that has been reversed with new medical procedures and CPR. The building of a dam can stop at any time. Even if a dam has been built it can be de constructed, and the land left to recover. Horgan might want to get that message. Its a waste of money to build the whole thing. Better to take the financial hit now and get over it. The pro media has done a good job of keeping it out of the news. Oh, well one good shake might put it on the front page or a bunch of deaths of workers, but until then, It is doubtful they will say much about it. In my opinion this dam is not about electricity, its about a reservoir and being able to export water. a water pipeline would be a piece of cake. Its all about the water and not about the electricity. What is being done to the families on site C is no different than was done by the Socreds back in the days when they were building dams. In this case though it will be dam Christy clark. I hope its not the same boffleheads that neglected to locate a source for the armour rock and must now haul it from a distant source across a (for now) non existent bridge. I sometimes wonder if its still on budget. And then I wonder if Anyone knows. I mean, you must have budgets and schedules to proceed with a venture like this. Vaughn Palmer says they know to the exact hour some five or six years in the future when the reservoir will be full as well as some 5,500 steps in between. Okay, got that off my chest. Will try to get some sleep now. The United Canada Party (UCP) is opposed to the Site C Dam and needs candidates who oppose it too. December 15, 2016 5:40 pm at 5:40 pm Curt Site C is an expensive venture not needed. Not their money.

Tribe members worried about their water supply, given the sometimes fragile nature of pipelines and the fact that it runs under the Missouri River. Sacred Native American burial grounds and land once used by their forefathers to hunt would be threatened, too, they said. Since then, more than 300 tribes have joined the fight, along with non-native Americans whose day jobs as lawyers and filmmakers and medical professionals have not kept them from pushing to be heard.

Reports of fire hoses dousing protesters in freezing night temperatures, rubber bullets bouncing off them, dozens of injuries and hundreds of arrests have fueled passions nationwide for months. Meanwhile, law enforcement officials in the trenches tell a different story, one of rioting and unruly behavior and trespassing, giving them no choice but to make arrests and defend themselves. Paige Abbott of Salem was having none of it, insisting that the police were to blame for any and all violence that has occurred. That said, fewer people had enough passion to attend than Young expected. This time the bank clock read 48 degrees, and it was dry.

The sun was setting on a late March evening as Mr. Perry listened to the voice on the other end of the line. Then came an extended pause, followed by a well-practiced recital of sympathies and condolences. Time to plan another funeral. An elder of the Ramapough Lenape Nation had just died, and Mr. Perry, as chief of the tribe, was charged with leading a prayer on behalf of the community. He has grown woefully accustomed to this ritual. This was the second elder to die that month and the third in a year. In the image, decades old, he is guiding a prayer ceremony, surrounded by more than three dozen tribal elders. Now only six elders remain. Crowding the desk before him was a vast assortment of documents, piled in unruly stacks. This is what the work of the chief had become: grant applications, local petitions, fund-raising letters, legal fees. Indeed, for the Ramapoughs, a group of indigenous people native to the highlands around Mahwah, N.J., life has often been a series of excruciating struggles over rights and resources. The tribe has an embattled history marked by colonial occupation, environmental degradation, discrimination, and clashes with politicians and real estate developers. Over the years, they have been left greatly diminished, a proud tribe working to stave off eradication and invisibility. But the Ramapoughs have experienced something of an awakening in recent months. Now this small and beleaguered community is preparing for battle with forces both local and national. For Mr. Perry, the stakes are nothing short of the existence of the Ramapoughs. The Ramapough Indians are descended from a Munsee-speaking subset of the Lenape, an aboriginal people of the Mid-Atlantic Region. They were once a vast and thriving tribe fanned across the area, but after European invasion many Ramapoughs dispersed across the West. Today, the tribe estimates, there are between 1,000 and 3,000 Ramapoughs in the area and as many as 4,000 nationally. Image Dwaine Perry, the chief of the Ramapough tribe, is determined to stave off the eradication of his people. The issue arises in part from a census classification system in New Jersey. This is hardly the stuff of colonial history. As a result of such prejudice, many Ramapoughs end up bridging two worlds. In private, they freely embrace tribal culture and customs, speaking Munsee and dressing in traditional garb. But outside of the home, many say, they assume a more assimilated lifestyle. Mr. Perry rarely uses his tribal moniker, Iron Bear, in public. It can be difficult, he said, to get a bank loan with such a name. Though their native region, only 30 miles from New York City, has become a relatively wealthy suburb, many Ramapoughs still straddle the poverty line. The unemployment rate is high, they say, and those who are employed mostly work modest jobs, such as plumbing or construction. Much of the Ramapough pass has been paved into highway. Gas stations, he said, stand atop tribal burial grounds. It can seem as if only vestiges of tribal life remain. CreditChristopher Occhicone for The New York Times Since he became chief in 2006, Mr. Perry has often found it challenging to mobilize the tribe in times of need. But recently he has fastened on to an issue that has alarmed his people. In 2014, Pilgrim Pipeline Holdings released plans to construct a pair of oil pipelines that would pass through Ramapough territory. According to the proposal, the pipelines would each stretch 178 miles underground, running from Albany to Linden, N.J. Heading south, the channel would carry 200,000 barrels each day of crude Bakken shale, a volatile variety of oil from Montana and North Dakota. Gasoline and aviation fuel would flow north. But many environmental experts caution that the pipeline poses a risk of widespread safety hazards and pollution, with the possibility for a spill that could taint several critical sources of drinking water for New York and New Jersey. In the heart of the affected zone would be the Ramapoughs, who say their sacred sites could be violated, along with the risk to their river. At that time, the earlier elders always advised, the Ramapoughs would have to band together to pray in the night and protect the earth. This is not the first time the tribe has faced environmental peril. Between 1967 and 1971, the Ford Motor Company dumped industrial waste from its nearby factory in the woods of Upper Ringwood, where many Ramapough families lived. Large swaths of the community had asthma, cancer, diabetes, miscarriages, skin conditions. To this day, the Environmental Protection Agency is overseeing a remediation of the site. The Pilgrim pipeline faces months of reviews before approval can be granted, but the Ramapoughs are already leading a forceful resistance. Soon after the pipeline was proposed, Mr. Perry marshaled the tribe to action, organizing rallies, lobbying local politicians and packing a series of raucous public meetings. Their efforts intensified last fall. Inspired by protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline that drew thousands of indigenous people and their allies to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota last year, the tribe began holding demonstrations at Split Rock Sweetwater Prayer Camp, the main ceremonial grounds of its 14-acre territory. They have also erected several tepees that serve as a popular hub for prayer and organizing, and a small number of people have been staying in tents on the property. Image Muriyd Williams, also known as Two Clouds, prepares fire wood at the camp. CreditChristopher Occhicone for The New York Times The pipeline protest has united the Ramapoughs unlike any moment many elders can recall. Some lapsed Ramapoughs have even been inspired to connect with tribal life once again. Muriyd Williams, 24, who goes by the tribal name Two Clouds, is descended from the tribe through his Ramapough grandmother. But after years of intolerance from people in the area, his grandmother began telling people she was Sicilian and encouraged him to hide his heritage. Around the time the pipeline was proposed, though, he dived back into the Ramapough community. Now, he is one of around a half-dozen tribal members occupying the prayer camp. He is also learning Munsee and educating nearby college students about the tribe. While the tribe and allied environmental groups intend to block approval of the pipeline at the state level, they worry that conservative leaders in Washington could upend the entire regulatory process. For many Ramapoughs, that fear is rooted in a rancorous history with Mr. Trump. In 1993, the tribe was already recognized by New Jersey and was under consideration for federal status when he began a crusade to thwart the application. Fearing competition for his casinos in Atlantic City, Mr. Trump filed a federal lawsuit claiming that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, which allows for gambling on tribal land, discriminated against him. The suit was accompanied by an aggressive media campaign. Image Jamie Rose of Hilburn, N.Y., lights a fire at an anti-pipeline rally. Without federal designation, the Ramapoughs are excluded from a variety of rights and services, such as financial loans, health care access, allotted land and tribal governance. But before they can take on Mr. Trump, the Ramapoughs must contend with their neighbors. Ever since the tribe began demonstrations on its campground, residents and local officials from Mahwah have been at loggerheads with the Ramapoughs. A week later, neighbors again called, now claiming excessive noise. Around the same time, Ramapoughs reported to the police that they found their property had been defaced with bigoted messages, including a swastika. The graffiti allegations followed episodes earlier that year, in which the tribe reported that several of its religious items had been stolen or vandalized. They say that similar sanctions are not imposed upon nonindigenous residents who, for example, camp in their yards or erect canopies for parties. Image Mr. Perry directs Mr. Williams and Don Wiese as they hang a tarp on the food shed; structures erected at the camp have drawn complaints from Mahwah, N.J., residents. The town, he said, is simply enforcing zoning laws for safety purposes. Even amid the simmering tensions, the pipeline protests have continued. On a Sunday afternoon during the winter, more than 100 people converged on the prayer camp for a religious ceremony and teach-in. The gathering, which included drum circles and solemn worship, was filled with a sense of mission. As they packed into a tepee, faces aglow around a raging fire, the protesters seemed ready for wherever that dispute may take them. One man said he would sleep out there every night if he had to, and another said he would go so far as to chain himself to an excavator. But that fervor has been tricky to sustain. Only two days after the rally, Mr. Trump signed executive orders reviving both the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. For the tribe, the losses were demoralizing and depleting. With countless other crises to manage under the new administration, many local activists seem to have diverted their attention elsewhere. It was an overcast morning in March, and Mr. Perry was sitting inside the tepee on his designated tree stump. The survival of the Ramapoughs, he knew, was in the hands of the tribe alone, and there was something both empowering and grim about that fact. That morning, a storm appeared to be looming over the mountain, so his goal was simply to maintain a fire inside the tent. Gusts of wind whipped against the tepee, and the fire began to flicker. Soon the blaze was down to embers. Then a flap lifted and in walked Two Clouds, a bundle of logs in each arm. The chief lowered himself back onto his stump and watched as the young man arranged the wood in a careful stack atop the embers. The fire was soon burning and it was beginning to feel warm inside.

Gas stations, he said, stand atop tribal burial grounds. he became chief in 2006, Mr. Perry has often found it challenging to mobilize the tribe in times of need. But recently he has fastened on to an issue that has alarmed his people. released plans to construct a pair of oil pipelines that would pass through Ramapough territory. According to the proposal, the pipelines would each stretch 178 miles underground, running from Albany to Linden, N.J. Heading south, the channel would carry 200,000 barrels each day of crude Bakken shale, a volatile variety of oil from Montana and North Dakota. caution that the pipeline poses a risk of widespread safety hazards and pollution, with the possibility for a spill that could taint several critical sources of drinking water for New York and New Jersey. the heart of the affected zone would be the Ramapoughs, who say their sacred sites could be violated, along with the risk to their river. Between 1967 and 1971, the Ford Motor Company dumped industrial waste from its nearby factory in the woods of Upper Ringwood, where many Ramapough families lived. Large swaths of the community had asthma, cancer, diabetes, miscarriages, skin conditions. Pilgrim pipeline faces months of reviews before approval can be granted, but the Ramapoughs are already leading a forceful resistance. efforts intensified last fall. Inspired by protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline that drew thousands of indigenous people and their allies to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota last year, the tribe began holding demonstrations at Split Rock Sweetwater Prayer Camp, the main ceremonial grounds of its 14-acre territory. pipeline protest has united the Ramapoughs unlike any moment many elders can recall. Williams, 24, who goes by the tribal name Two Clouds, is descended from the tribe through his Ramapough grandmother. But after years of intolerance from people in the area, his grandmother began telling people she was Sicilian and encouraged him to hide his heritage. Around the time the pipeline was proposed, though, he dived back into the Ramapough community. Now, he is one of around a half-dozen tribal members occupying the prayer camp. many Ramapoughs, that fear is rooted in a rancorous history with Mr. Trump. In 1993, the tribe was already recognized by New Jersey and was under consideration for federal status when he began a crusade to thwart the application. suit was accompanied by an aggressive media campaign. before they can take on Mr. Trump, the Ramapoughs must contend with their neighbors. Ever since the tribe began demonstrations on its campground, residents and local officials from Mahwah have been at loggerheads with the Ramapoughs. A week later, neighbors again called, now claiming excessive noise. the same time, Ramapoughs reported to the police that they found their property had been defaced with bigoted messages, including a swastika. They say that similar sanctions are not imposed upon nonindigenous residents who, for example, camp in their yards or erect canopies for parties. amid the simmering tensions, the pipeline protests have continued. On a Sunday afternoon during the winter, more than 100 people converged on the prayer camp for a religious ceremony and teach-in. gathering, which included drum circles and solemn worship, was filled with a sense of mission. As they packed into a tepee, faces aglow around a raging fire, the protesters seemed ready for wherever that dispute may take them. that fervor has been tricky to sustain. Only two days after the rally, Mr. Trump signed executive orders reviving both the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. For the tribe, the losses were demoralizing and depleting. was an overcast morning in March, and Mr. Perry was sitting inside the tepee on his designated tree stump. The survival of the Ramapoughs, he knew, was in the hands of the tribe alone, and there was something both empowering and grim about that fact. a flap lifted and in walked Two Clouds, a bundle of logs in each arm.

Dalrymple cites the reason behind this order to be 'public safety concerns'. Just let that sink in for a minute... This order is so THICK with gross hypocrisy, it is hard to even know where to start. First of all, if Dalrymple had ANY concern for the safety of the public, he would not be letting the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) go through, as it an actual danger to the health and safety of the Native people, and to millions more who depend on the Missouri River as their main water source. He would not be unleashing his pigs to brutalize people, set their dogs on people, shoot rubber bullets at people, spray freezing cold water at people in freezing temperatures, seriously injure people with concussion grenades, spray people in the face point blank with mace and pepper spray. This could very well lead to tribal leaders coming under attack for not actively leading people to comply with this order. Hundreds of water protectors have been injured at the hands of the Sheriff's deputies and state police. Hey Dalrymple... If you are reading this, it seems to me like YOU are the threat to public safety in this case. YOU are the one calling for this escalation, not the water protectors. You have no idea how determined the people are, and how capable we are of getting through this brutal winter. Because the Native Americans and everyone who has come to stand up here are the ones who are actually concerned with the health and safety of the public, not just here at Standing Rock, but throughout the country, and the planet as a whole. We are protecting the water from people like you, who viciously resort to brutal and deadly force to enforce a system that can do no other than destroy the environment and continue to commit genocide against Native and other oppressed peoples.

I arrived last minute in the evening needing a place to sleep, and a friend said that there was space in a tipi. As I gladly accepted the offer to stay and a chance to sleep in a tipi for the first time, I had no idea I would meet two new wonderful friends. They were both so generous, offering blankets and pillows to me, the weary traveler. This particular night, they were housing six people, including myself. When I started to talk to them, I immediately realized they were from the South. I was curious to know more about the Cherokee, since I grew up so close to the tribe and know absolutely nothing about them. The sisters, Precise Lossie (pronounced Precious), 25, and Mona Lossiah (pronounced Monet), 27, were born and raised in Cherokee country. They were brought up by their grandmother. We lived with her in a small house on the mountain. She didn't trust the water from the pipes, because she thought that the government may put poison in it, so we had to carry water every day from the river. They both have a deep respect for the water and its value. Their grandmother only spoke Cherokee, and it was passed on from her grandmother. Precise and her sister are some of the few young people who speak Eastern Band Cherokee, which is getting lost and forgotten. Since the grandparents are the ones that pass on the traditions and wisdom, there is a major information-sharing gap in the tribe for the younger generations. Precise is a freelance writer currently working on a fictional memoir, but she hopes to also write down the language that she learned from her grandmother to share with the younger generation. They are practically attached at the hip. They make money on the Powwow Trail, which is basically going on the road as a vendor at Powwow shows selling peyote-stitch rope necklaces that they learned from a friend of the family. Precise also does some art work. They first came out to the Oceti Sakowin Camp in August for several weeks. When they had to return home, all they could think about was making it back out to camp. Mona says, laughing. She says it was all they could do, and they strongly feel that they need to be here at camp. We cannot leave. We have to see this through. We don't know how far capitalism is going to damage the environment and the earth to the point where it collapses in on itself, and we don't want that to happen, so we want to stop it. The girls plan to stay until the end, and they are working on starting a small kitchen for the campers. The knowledge, intelligence and beauty of spirit that these two girls possess is truly a gift in the Oceti Sakowin Camp. I can only hope that the Creator keeps them safe as this battle for Earth and future generations continues.

The subject of his essay: democracy and inequality. The 24-year-old former Marine corporal, three years into a history degree at Long Island University, began scanning social media to see what his friends were up to when an item in his Facebook newsfeed caught his eye. Victory Day Less than 24 hours later Nurdin stepped off an airplane in Fargo, N.D. The following evening, his rented Chevrolet Cruiser rolled into the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. The first snowflakes of a blizzard were beginning to fall, but fireworks lit up the sky. Members of the Standing Rock Sioux and their supporters have worked to prevent a multibillion-dollar consortium, Energy Transfer Partners, from installing an oil pipeline on their land. Part of a 1,172-mile project intended to carry oil from the Great Plains to Mississippi River ports in Illinois, the Dakota Access Pipeline was slated to travel through burial grounds the Sioux hold sacred. What began over the summer as a small protest camp established by the tribe to impede construction blossomed over the fall into a tent city with 15,000 inhabitants. A half-dozen camps sprouted up, dozens of kitchens and schools, supply and medical tents. Tens of thousands of people travelled through Standing Rock. Nurdin was part of a deployment of veterans to the reservation that weekend. About 2,000 were expected to turn up; more than 5,000 arrived. Many, including Nurdin, had never attended a protest in their lives, but decided to take part as word spread on social media that they were needed. A young woman from the Bronx, Sophia Wilansky, was forced to undergo multiple surgeries after local law enforcement unleashed a torrent of rubber bullets and concussion grenades at the protectors, destroying bones in her arm. Such acts of brutality harkened back the 1960s, with its images of Alabama police attacking civil rights demonstrators with clubs, dogs, and fire hoses: uniformed men treating people like dirt to be washed from the face of the earth. It was as if the results of the presidential election were manifesting themselves even before Donald Trump took office. On Sunday, Dec. 4, as more veterans streamed into Standing Rock, word came down that the Army Corps of Engineers had denied Energy Transfer a permit to drill beneath the Missouri. Celebrations erupted in the camps. Yet throughout the rest of the nation, a different story has unfolded in recent months, perhaps the greatest victory the forces of ignorance, bigotry, fear, misogyny and violence in America have scored in decades. The rise of barbarism from beyond Standing Rock could nullify its accomplishments, if the lessons learned within the encampments go unheeded. Values The good news, you might say, is that Donald Trump has finally stripped away the last vestiges of respectability from American politics. Trump demonstrates unequivocally that there is no inherent dignity in any office, including the highest in the land. They demonstrated that persistent, collective acts of peaceful dissent can overcome concussion grenades, rubber bullets, schutzhund packs, tear gas, mace and the wealthiest corporations in history. For decades the political right billed itself as the party of patriotism, family and faith. In so doing, it has presented an opening for progressives to conquer and replenish moral high ground long ago ceded to the Republicans who have desecrated it. Kauff was arrested for blocking pipeline construction at Standing Rock in October and traveled there again for the mass veterans mobilization. In the wee hours of Dec. 5, the tent where he and around 30 other veterans were sleeping caved in during a snowstorm, exposing them to snow and gale-force winds. They sought shelter in a nearby medical tent. Later in the day, they were among the droves of protectors who took refuge from the storm in the nearby Standing Rock casino. There, a ceremony took place involving 500 former military personnel. But they realize if you carry animosity in your heart, it eats you up. The slogan made its rounds during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last summer, popping up on placards as if strategically placed there so that Hillary Clinton could use it in her acceptance speech and echo the masses. Love, after all, is a four-letter word. Actions give it substance. It was a statement that signified nothing. What politicians greasing the levers for a smooth transition of power miss is that Trump is not just another politician. And yet we must avoid the tendency to see protest as an end in itself, rather than a means of achieving power. Infiltrators were surrounded by security and forced to leave the camp. It will take a Standing Rock nation to hold him back."}, {"URL": "http://wesleystudi.com/wes-stands-with-standing-rock/", "Timestamp": "20180919005909", "Sentences": "Home Wesley lorem ipsum Hostiles Home Contact About Blog Facebook twitter 404 The page you were looking for doesn't appear to exist."}, {"URL": "https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/divest_from_dapl_23/?wuCTilb", "Timestamp": "20180918222008", "Sentences": "Got it We use cookies to analyse how visitors use this website and to help us provide you the best possible experience.

On the basis of their answers, we divided participants into three groups: strong believers in man-made climate change, moderate believers and weak believers. Next we informed participants that many scientists have said that by the year 2100, the average temperature in the United States will rise at least 6 degrees Fahrenheit, and asked them for their own estimates of likely temperature rise by 2100. The overall average was 5.6 degrees Fahrenheit. As expected, there were significant differences among the three groups: 6.3 degrees for strong believers in man-made climate change, 5.9 degrees for moderate believers and 3.6 degrees for weak believers. Then came the important part of the experiment. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two conditions. Half of them received information that was more encouraging than what they originally received (good news for the planet and humanity); half of them received information that was less encouraging (bad news for the planet and humanity). In the good news condition, they were told to assume that in recent weeks, prominent scientists had reassessed the science and concluded the situation was far better than previously thought, suggesting a likely temperature increase of only 1 to 5 degrees. In the bad news condition, participants were told to assume that in recent weeks, prominent scientists had reassessed the science and concluded the situation was far worse than previously thought, suggesting a likely temperature increase of 7 to 11 degrees. All participants were then asked to provide their personal estimates. Weak believers in man-made climate change were moved by the good news (their average estimate fell by about 1 degree), but their belief was unchanged by the bad news (their average estimate stayed essentially constant). By contrast, strong believers in man-made climate change were far more moved by the bad news (their average estimate jumped by nearly 2 degrees), whereas with good news, it fell by less than half of that (.9 degrees). Moderate climate change believers were equally moved in both cases (they changed their estimates by approximately 1.5 degrees in each case). Strong believers will show the opposite pattern. But at times, good political news can threaten our deepest commitments, and we will give it less weight. These findings help explain polarization on many issues. With respect to the Affordable Care Act, for example, people encounter good news, to the effect that it has helped millions of people obtain health insurance, and also bad news, to the effect that health care costs and insurance premiums continue to increase. As the sheer volume of information increases, polarization will be heightened as well. Voters are now receiving a steady stream of both positive and negative information about Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump. In our experiment, a strong majority showed movement; few people were impervious to new information. Most people were willing to change their views, at least to some extent.

The milestone is a sign of the aggressive voter registration efforts ahead of Nov. 8 and a symptom of the fast-growing and demographically shifting electorate that is expected to redound to the benefit of the Democratic Party in the coming years. Story Continued Below There is no current national database of voter registration because each state independently runs its own election. But TargetSmart, a Democratic political data firm, told POLITICO that the country passed the 200 million threshold in recent days as North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada and New York reported new voter numbers. Tom Bonier, CEO of TargetSmart, said national registration now stands at 200,081,377 voters. The figure means more than 50 million new people have registered to vote in the past eight years. Only 146.3 million were registered as recently as 2008, when then-Sen. The last time a Clinton was on the presidential ballot 20 years ago, the electorate was 127.6 million people. The wave of new voters this year has dramatically favored the Democratic Party, according to TargetSmart, which analyzed the expected party preferences of the new registrants in 15 of the first- and second-tier presidential battlegrounds. Overall, TargetSmart found that 42.6 percent of the new voters registered this year lean Democratic, and only 29 percent lean Republican (28.4 percent lean independent). Worse for the GOP, registration trended more Democratic in every single battleground state, from a small margin in Georgia (4.3 percentage points) to massive leads in diversifying states like Colorado (29.3 points), Nevada (20.4 points) and North Carolina (9.2 points). And since June 1, the trend has been even more stark. Across all 15 battlegrounds, the Democratic advantage is nearly 22 percentage points since June 1. Clinton is pushing aggressively for increased turnout among black, Asian-American and Hispanic voters. The electorate has been growing by leaps in recent years, with Hispanic population growth behind much of the surge. Two decades ago, in 1996, there were not even 200 million people of voting-age population in the United States, let alone registered voters. The Clinton campaign has been preparing for and predicting record-setting turnout this fall even amid widespread frustration about the tenor of the campaign. Previously, the biggest turnout in presidential election history came in 2008, when 131.4 million people voted (turnout dipped slightly to 129.2 million in 2012). By percentage, however, the share of eligible Americans who actually complete ballots is not expected to be anywhere near a record. It has been nearly a half-century since 60 percent of voting-age adults voted. That last happened in 1968."}, {"URL": "http://www.opednews.com/author/author3681.html", "Timestamp": "20180919000108", "Sentences": "You'll get emails whenever I post articles on OpEdNews Georgianne Nienaber is an investigative environmental and political writer.

The protective covering I rigged over our shared tent flapped frozen against the outside. I was too tired to even be bothered by it at all. Fortunately, the sleeping bag was designed for this climate. I hoped my tent partner, Jasmine, was warm enough as I covered her gently in an extra blanket. A person I have never met before from Brooklyn was sharing her tent. It was a warm space in a brutal North Dakota winter. In the early morning, the wind howled incessantly as the drums began. I was up early to place my corn pollen in prayer toward the rising sun. After a hardy breakfast, I charged up my cell phone on one of the many solar charging stations. The drone of the plane began as well. All day and long into the night, our receptions were disturbed. Other drums began beating as more voices awoke the camp. Bundled up figures emerged from each camp as morning greetings were exchanged. After chopping and stacking firewood, I made my way up to Media Hill to send out updates. These beautiful people gifted me with a sacred stone necklace made of jade. The hill to the north was lined with police and their armored vehicles. A show of force, taunting. We thrived with and in peace in that camp. Caravans were made to Bismarck to march in solidarity for all water users. The time I spent in the city was quite nice. I expected a bit of hostility but none materialized. We looked camping scruffy and brown, but met with little notice. I spoke with a young man doubting himself after witnessing the horror on the bridge the night before. His weight lifted. Everyone looks after the other. We prayed with the river. We knelt on the ice-crusted bank. I saw them on the ridge. The cold blew through you with ease. Music was almost constant, as pure as the love and support you felt from every person. Thanksgiving, as ironic a day it was, still fed us in spirit and body. The real words and songs from elders ushered in the serving of food. The elders, we were served first by the young ones. It was a great moment to be an elder. Though, I am introduced as the youngest elder. The medical camp also included herbal healing and massage yurts, where I received the most memorable bodywork as the Water Protectors crossed over en mass to Turtle Island. I chose to stay calm. I grinned at the irony. The freezing cold makes the body tire out completely. As the day of thanks ended, I was so exhausted from the cold and tryptophan. I believe everyone was fed the traditional Thanksgiving meal: Bison stew and other supporting cast of culinary delight. We did give gratitude to the great spirit of the Universal Kindness. Below the iron gaze of the police there on the hill, we gave our thanks not for the pilgrims, but for our strength, perseverance, and hopes for an outcome acknowledging our tribal sanctity. The bitter cold wind blew across the camp as the sun sat on another day at Oceti Sakowin, by the Cannonball River where we chose to take our stand. We fell into our tent and fell deeper into a well-earned slumber. The memories of faces and conversations of the day receded gently into calmness. The night crept into every habitat below the blanket of starry, starry night. We fell asleep undisturbed despite the noise of the flapping frozen tarp on our tent, despite the drums and the threats just over the hill. The howling wind blew all night. I dreamt warming dreams.

The encampment closed last week. The atmosphere of sad futility, reinforced by pictures of burning tents and piles of trash in lanes of mud, is heavier for the inevitability connected to it. In mid-September the overwhelming feeling at the Seven Fires camp was of dedication and goodwill among all there, a powerful sense of purpose drawn intimately from Native American spiritual practice. One felt, even as a witness, part of an enormous ceremony, one of regular public prayer and thanksgiving, something that transcended the visible horizon and everyday concerns. None of this, of course, happened. A series of drive-by celebrity appearances, welcomed by organizers, brought more public attention than greater appreciation of what Native People were attempting there. Unfortunately, the image of the elderly, portly Rev. Jesse Jackson propped on one of the camp ponies for a quick October photo-op spoke more about a tiresome variety of political theater than any Truth to Power. What once had operated in a spirit of non-violence, accord, and respect, especially for Native elders, devolved to competing agendas and personal fiat. Native participation dropped dramatically as white people, accused by Indian organizers in late November of treating the camp as another Burning Man party, arrived in growing numbers. This came a week after the Standing Rock tribal council, by unanimous vote, asked the militant Red Warriors camp, an Indigenous group, to leave after a violent clash with law enforcement. The Standing Rock tribe had supplied sustaining support even as outside donations poured in. Portable sanitary facilities had been cleared daily at tribal expense, that is until they froze in subzero conditions (one doubts they were replaced by any effective winter alternative). Meanwhile police roadblocks, and a central bridge damaged in the worst violence in late October, had the added effect of cutting off easy access from Bismarck to the tribal casino. While a council vote in mid-October had nominally allowed the camp to move onto the reservation, it was pointedly not unanimous and, anyway, the camp was too big to relocate, reaching an estimated peak of a nearly unimaginable 10,000 people. An orientation class became necessary for newcomers; mainly to explain aspects of Native American culture many felt were being disrespected. That these events also coincided with a direction by the Obama administration for the Army Corps to begin an environmental impact statement was seen as a great victory, though the outcome of the election a month later quickly put paid to that. Any desire of continued resistance had to overcome the inertia of what remained: ill will among groups of protestors, a constant feeling of surveillance and siege, dwindling tribal support, harsh winter conditions, and the coming spring flood. In early December, the Standing Rock council asked all non-Sioux protestors to leave, which was followed in late January by a request for all to go. The fight, the council observed, is now in the courts. The Army Corps announced that an eviction notice given in early December would be enforced February 23. By then most on site finally complied, setting fire to tents and buildings before leaving, as disposal crews began hauling tons of trash from what is now another prairie ghost town. One wonders if those who stayed to be arrested, however fine their intentions, had anywhere else to go. It would be wrong to judge the success or failure of the Standing Rock protest only on the outcome of the Dakota pipeline project, or the final condition of the Seven Fires camp. As a matter of inter-tribal accord for the indigenous people of North and South America, it may be of lasting importance. It was also an historic opportunity for native people to express on a personal level a regained sense of autonomy and pride, a reengagement with practices dormant for 150 years. As a political event with great spiritual significance, the effect of the great Seven Council Fires camp could be a lasting pan-Indian movement, one mainly invisible to outsiders. Some wrapped in righteous anger and self-regard will have learned absolutely nothing, both extremes of the divide looking forward to the next barricade to build up or knock down. We learned that the pull away from engaged first principles towards opportunistic theater is as strong as ever. Others realized the extent to which state authority will go to protect private interests. Promised reimbursements by the State of North Dakota, totaling millions, to these distant jurisdictions are still pending. As impromptu and lightly organized as the Standing Rock protest was, it exposed a parallel, and less understandable, dysfunction in the economic and civic planning behind the Dakota pipeline in the first place. For one thing, current oil prices make the pipeline barely profitable; the same goes with coal. Long-range market forces are turning energy extraction into a losing proposition for the American West. The North Dakota government was ill prepared and over-reactive, apparently moved at the start from fear and anger more than maintaining any sense of public well being. Morton County opened itself up to hundreds of police misconduct suits that can only jam an already burdened court system. It would not be surprising if all but the most serious felony criminal charges connected to the protests are soon dropped. The long emergency at Standing Rock has unfolded in the midst of a broader crisis in the West, one with all the marks of a culture collapse resembling the one that overwhelmed native communities 140 years ago. Some will challenge this notion. A declining extraction economy, recapitulating the disappearance of the buffalo herds, may be less a cause of the collapse than a symptom of a greater cultural lack, a narrowness of empathy, imagination, and spirit, in the ruling order.

In mid-September the overwhelming feeling at the Seven Fires camp was of dedication and goodwill among all there, a powerful sense of purpose drawn intimately from Native American spiritual practice. None of this, of course, happened. A series of drive-by celebrity appearances, welcomed by organizers, brought more public attention than greater appreciation of what Native People were attempting there. Native participation dropped dramatically as white people, accused by Indian organizers in late November of treating the camp as another Burning Man party, arrived in growing numbers. Standing Rock tribe had supplied sustaining support even as outside donations poured in. Portable sanitary facilities had been cleared daily at tribal expense, that is until they froze in subzero conditions (one doubts they were replaced by any effective winter alternative). Meanwhile police roadblocks, and a central bridge damaged in the worst violence in late October, had the added effect of cutting off easy access from Bismarck to the tribal casino. orientation class became necessary for newcomers; mainly to explain aspects of Native American culture many felt were being disrespected. these events also coincided with a direction by the Obama administration for the Army Corps to begin an environmental impact statement was seen as a great victory, though the outcome of the election a month later quickly put paid to that. early December, the Standing Rock council asked all non-Sioux protestors to leave, which was followed in late January by a request for all to go. The fight, the council observed, is now in the courts. The Army Corps announced that an eviction notice given in early December would be enforced February 23. By then most on site finally complied, setting fire to tents and buildings before leaving, as disposal crews began hauling tons of trash from what is now another prairie ghost town.

The day after the news, on Dec. 5, there was a huge demonstration during which most of the camp marched against the wind into a blizzard, toward the bridge that the police had occupied. And then the protesters got back to work. Even when David Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, told protesters it was time to go home and be with their families for the winter, many were reluctant. And the whole thing could be reversed by President-elect Donald Trump once he takes office. But whatever happens next, the ideals that catalyzed the Standing Rock protest are not going away. Pipeline supporters, by contrast, have short-term goals. They want to finish the pipeline, start pumping oil, and start making money. Plus, the government is about to open a gleaming new water-treatment plant, so, really, the concern that a pipeline break could contaminate their drinking water is actually unnecessary. Case closed. These arguments hold up so long as you think about them only within the narrow framework of the short term. As soon as you consider the long term, they fall apart. Advertisement The long term is what brought the environmentalists there, too, even though the actual decisions made at Standing Rock so far have been more fundamentally about land rights than about climate change. These concerns intermingled at Standing Rock, and one lasting prize of the protests might be the alliances they produced, a sort of coalition of the long term: Sioux Indians worried about their drinking water. Environmental activists concerned about the viability of the planet and the way our fossil-fuel dependence gets consecrated in our infrastructure. Veterans showing up out of a wish to protect the Constitution. Black Lives Matter activists who saw their own long cause in the police brutality visited upon Native Americans at Standing Rock and across the country. Standing Rock attracted the politically engaged, but also the politically disaffected. Still, they were camping out in the Great Plains in the middle of winter for a cause. Much has been said about the Americans whose grievances have not been recognized or addressed by our current politics. Some took their dissatisfaction to the ballot box. Others took it to Standing Rock. Veterans continued arriving even after the announcement. Trump is pro-pipeline generally, and he stands to gain financially from this one specifically. He will be the only world leader to deny the reality of climate change and the first president to have been elected without prior government experience. On Wednesday, Trump named a climate change denialist to head his EPA. Oil executive Rex Tillerson is the leading front-runner for secretary of state. Short-termism is running the country. Standing Rock is not going away. The perimeter of the Oceti Sakowin camp, Dec. 3.

Nancy Goate of United Tribes for Christ Fellowship Talks about the DAPL, the current protests, and the doors Christ has opened to make a difference. DEBRIEFING ON THE DAKOTA ACCESS PIPE LINE (DAPL) A Violation of Human Rights The Dakota Access Pipe Line (DAPL) is a multi-billion dollar project that will shuttle millions of gallons of crude oil across America via thousands of miles of pipeline placed directly beneath our most vital waterways. The current protests by more than 100 Native American tribes and many others across the globe has garnered international attention despite a media blackout that has endured for months. The current DAPL situation has escalated to a critical and urgent status. As brutal winter months progress, law enforcement officials have taken to the use of water cannons, spraying hundreds of protestors in below freezing temperatures. Tear gas, grenades, and rubber bullets have been launched in a lethal manner by targeting people in the face, head, and even the groin. Critical injuries have been sustained by many, including blunt trauma, head trauma, maiming, and loss of life and limb. Peaceful protestors standing united in prayer have been apprehended by force and jailed in dog cages. Professional journalists who dare to provide coverage have been threatened with prison sentences up to 40 years, and medics (RN & physicians) treating the victims of this abuse have been shot at with water cannons, rubber bullets, and tear gas themselves. Emergency Medical Service (EMS) personnel have also been blocked en route to hospitals by law enforcement vehicles, whereby alternate routes have needed to be taken. This is happening in the United States of America. Today we are going to talk about this and how you can be an integral part of serving and protecting peaceful protestors against abusive law enforcement entities who are employing illegal tactics. This cruel, inhumane, and insufferable treatment, which is very well-documented by the private sector, must STOP. Law enforcement officials must cease and desist immediately, and they must be held accountable and brought to justice. These unarmed civilians have gathered peacefully in prayer, ritual song and dance, and encampment blocking the DAPL construction site along the Missouri River and other waterways, all which are upon treaty land. Aside from water, their burial grounds and sacred sites are also being threatened. Despite the illegal and inhumane tactics employed against them, the protestors are more resolute than ever and they are not standing down. They plan to endure through Winter, and every manner of help is needed for their well-being and survival. This is your opportunity to get involved through prayer, practical helps, provision of aid and supplies, volunteer work, and informative sharing. Be a voice. Please stand with us. VIEW PHYSICIAN STATEMENTS OF DAPL PROTESTS EP: Nancy, I want to thank you so much for doing this interview at the last minute prior to the holidays. I wanted to start out by talking about the DAPL. So, the Sioux youth of Standing Rock, North Dakota, ran two-thousand miles, all the way from North Dakota straight to Washington, D.C. They ran to make the government aware, and the President aware, of what was going on and to get help. This started back in April, and at that point I know the public as a whole did not know this was going on. So they brought it to the forefront and now there are thousands of us that know, but there are also millions of people, in my estimation, who do not know what is happening. EP: Correct. NG: And so, when they started this, I know they were there to present a letter to the President and it was not taken. They shunned them. And so they came back to North Dakota and they decided to make a stand on their land, according to the 1851 Treaty land. This is Sioux land, and they made a stand there, because the fact of it is that it was supposed to have been routed into Bismarck, North Dakota. And so they moved it to the territories, the Native American territory, and that happens to be Standing Rock, North Dakota, which is the reservation for the Sioux people. There are major injuries there. I just read a report today where a woman who was at Standing Rock, was critically injured by the water cannons and rubber bullets and the different things they are putting out there. She may lose her arm. And she had no weapons on her. She had NO weapons on her. And she was just standing there protecting the water, telling them, the military police to leave. And I say military police is because they are in riot gear from head to toe. EP: They are the National Guard. The National Guard has actually been sent by the Federal Government to stop the protesting. And these are peaceful protests. They are setting up camps, and they are doing everything very peacefully. Yet still we see local, state, and federal government officials coming out and doing egregious things; very inhumane treatment. Injustice has continued year after year after year, and there is no justice for Native American rights. But there are, there are thousands and thousands who have come to Standing Rock and have camped out. There are people who are settling in, in this harsh climate. They are seeing this through all the way to whatever happens. And so, they are not leaving, and there are more and more people coming. We had people there, I think from Hawaii; people from Asia, the Chinese people were there. There are other people from Australia and they were indigenous groups. They consider themselves indigenous groups standing with the Native Americans at Standing Rock. THE CRITICAL INJURY OF SOPHIA WILANSKY Visit the following link for the story on Sophia Wilansky who was shot with a concussion grenade and subsequently suffered critical injuries that threatened her left arm and hand. She is currently under the care of Minneapolis surgeons at a local hospital, and has undergone extensive surgery. We are also gathering supplies for our own needs. It may be a week. It may be a month. We also have many people who are just donating because they know we are going, and so we have individual donations. But I believe, just like we have been led by the LORD to go, I believe we need to go without fear, with HIS strength because of who we know the LORD is, that we go in strength that we go in power. He went with no fear. He went without the covering of unproven things, and he trusted in the LORD completely. And he slew Goliath and was successful. The fear that was hovering over the people, I mean David was very successful in destroying that. EP: You made a statement regarding the Native American people, that the history has never stopped. And I love that you said that. I know that a lot of people from all over America and Canada are coming together. This is the greatest move of unity among Native people seen in the history of America. They are going to stay. They are going to see this through. NG: Right. EP: And it really shows us as American people, the resilience of the Native American spirit. NG: Mmm-hmmm. EP: And the valiant spirit God has put within them as a people. And yet we see these horrible acts of aggression. So, the plan, the hope, the prayer is that a successful stand will have been made. One of the largest in the world, actually. And this is a water source for all the American people. It affects everyone. So really, the Native people are not just fighting for their own water and their own land. Some were successful, and some were not. So this goes far beyond the people here, beyond the tribes, beyond the United States. It goes across the land. They understand it. And it does affect the international community. It absolutely does. What is so sad is that the media has completely blacklisted this event; these protests that have gone on for months. We are now at a critical juncture, as you said, the winter months are here. And the Native American people and other protestors in that area are going to need supplies. And the numbers continue to grow. NG: The report came back from four young ladies. They said the LORD had sent them to go and to minister. They prayed and they went. Twenty years old to thirty-five or so. When they were there people just began to come and visit them. But as they did that people began to come and get with them and talk with them. They prayed with them, and then eventually, the word got out that they were there: that there were young Christian women in the camp. They were also able to go and minister in their Native hymnal songs, the Seminole and Creek language, and they sang it under the anointing because people in that camp began to cry. They fell to their knees; they began to raise their hands, and then one of the girls, prayed a powerful prayer according to the other three young ladies. It was such a powerful prayer. People began to come to them. They prayed with several people. It just opened the door right there. NG: Yes, approximately a month. In December. EP: In December, okay. NG: As Christian people I believe we need to physically go and help volunteer whatever the need is there. We need to be able to help in whatever area. But we are definitely taking supplies. We have a business group who is going to be donating supplies. I hope that they do. They need sub-zero clothing, gloves, and hats. So we will be donating and volunteering. There will be at least five of us that will be staying, at least for a month. NG: There is definitely room. Maybe have services there; have some type of place where they can come. People who are experiencing trauma; that they can come and relax in a place where they can feel the peace of God and warm up. You know, whatever we can offer them. I mean, there are definitely dangers ahead for those who are going to join the protest. EP: Correct. NG: No, no. They come at their own risk. NG: Okay, this is harsh winter. So you need to bring with you some sub-zero clothing; headgear; gloves; boots; socks; maybe if you have some ski-gear. So, it will be very cold. Bring food with you. Some soup. You need to bring plenty of blankets. We also need generators. So, things like that. But you need to look at yourself. Figure out just how well you can handle the cold, and come dressed appropriately. NG: Exactly. Exactly. But yes, when you come you have to realize this is going to be a primitive camping. So bring whatever you need to do primitive camping. You will not have access to running water. You will not have access to just heat anywhere. There are no shelters; no houses; not anything out there. The people that are staying are in tents. They built temporary shelter, but those are for the people staying for the long haul. Totally prepared for this type of weather. NG: Yes, if that happens then we will wait. We will wait just a little while longer, but I expect to have the supplies delivered to me by November 29th. So, as far as I know, that has not changed. I can get that online. But the supplies should come November 29th. EP: Okay, very good to know. EP: Okay. But we will share. EP: Well, Nancy, thank you so much for your time. And we are definitely with you in spirit and we will be keeping you in our prayers. And we will be praying for a successful trip and mission, and an excellent report when you get back. Used with permission. Photo of Nancy Goate at GTN Banquet by Phillip Harrison.

People continue to pile in from all around the country despite inclement weather, an emergency evacuation placed by the governor, and a notice of eviction from the Army Corps for the Oceti Sakowin that grows closer by the day. While you would think this growing support would be an invaluable asset to all those brave enough to stand against what appears to be the impending possibility of arrests and more police violence, which it is to a degree, at the same time, it is becoming a blessing and a curse. As people flood into Standing Rock, they are bringing along with them their personal views and agendas. Among these personal views, there is an apparent calling to white America to come and witness the Native American culture. I cannot count the number of times I have heard white people talking about how this is affecting them, and how they felt compelled to come and stand with their Native American brothers and sisters, and there is nothing wrong with wanting to be united with your fellow humans during a time of crisis. Here is where the problem comes into play. I have seen a lot of outsiders feel they are entitled to take part in the Native American prayers and ceremonies just because they came here to show support. For the Native Americans, their ways are not a religion that can be dropped to switch to another at the drop of a dime; it is a way of life. Their way of life. If you want to experience the Native American culture, contact any one of the many reservations around the country and go about it in a proper and respectful manner. The fact of the matter is, out of every race in the United States of America, Native Americans have it the worst. The Native Americans have been the victims of genocide and land theft since the moment we arrived on their land. It has not stopped, and the situation in Standing Rock shows it is not going to end anytime soon. Native Americans also face the highest chance of being shot by a police officer out of every ethnicity. Native Americans are three times more likely to be shot by a police officer. What makes the problem with Native American involved police shootings is that they also often go unreported. From May 1, 2014, and October 31, 2015, there were 29 Native Americans killed by police, yet only one of those shootings received any significant attention. Paul Castaway from the Rosebud Sioux was shot and killed by police in Denver after he had threatened to commit suicide. Another Native American man was misidentified as being Latino. It is sad how many people think casinos and government checks when they think of Native Americans. A false image that all tribes are financially set. That is simply is not the case. Most of the tribes are broke, with only the tribal councils benefitting financially from any benefits received from the federal government or programs the tribes have. Standing Rock is a perfect example to see exactly how little the American government cares about the Native American people. While the Black Lives Matters movement has gained a significant amount of support, the problems in the Native American communities have continued to be ignored. With a strong media focus on police shootings, it is strange that Native Americans are not sitting at the table for discussion since statistically their chance of being shot by a police officer is much higher than any other race. The shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri set the stage for a new civil rights movement throughout the African-American community. Directly after the shooting of Brown, officers used an excessive amount of tear gas on protesters for days in a row. Law enforcement in Ferguson was quickly reprimanded and denied the continued use of tear gas against protesters. In Standing Rock, following an incredibly brutal attack by law enforcement just over a week ago, nobody has stepped in. Water was sprayed on people in 23-degree weather, and nobody stepped in. Tear gas, mace and rubber bullets were used, and nobody stepped in. Sophia Wilansky had her arm severely injured by a grenade, and Vanessa Dundon woman lost vision in her right eye, and nobody stepped in. The situation in Standing Rock is not the first time that white-America has tried to force their sympathy and urge to identify with the struggle of another race into the wrong situation at the wrong time. One day we are going to just have to accept that we will never understand the struggles that other ethnicities are forced to go through. If we learned anything from this last election it is that, as much as we may want to deny it, racism is alive and well in this country and it is not just towards the African-American community. Many arrived with little or nothing to support themselves. No tent, no money, no winter clothing, and no real knowledge on what why exactly they are here, which makes them an immediate drain on the camps that have been working for months to prepare for winter. Those coming to Standing Rock need to remember that this is a serious situation, and those coming need to treat it as such. Aside from being at the beginning of a winter that can be deadly, past injuries from law enforcement show the very real danger the people here are facing. This is not the time or place to learn about Native American culture, score some social media pictures, or to have a free place to stay. If you are coming to Standing Rock, be able to bring something to the table. Be able to contribute to the people around you. But, most importantly, pay respect. The Native Americans do not owe you anything for coming here to show support. That is your choice."}, {"URL": "http://hpr1.com/index.php/opinion/gadfly/pq-who-is-creating-all-of-these-socialists-of-course-its-american-capitalis/", "Timestamp": "20180918221943", "Sentences": "In this new field, scientists and mathematicians analyze history in the hopes they can find trends and patterns in order to predict the future. I wonder if they are analyzing history to see if there ever was a leader with less character than Donald Trump. This inquiring mind wants to know. Evidently he views most women as Rottweilers, French poodles, black Labradors, cocker spaniels, and promiscuous bitches. But I think the best demonstration of his total lack of character is his public treatment of Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona who is dying of brain cancer. He often ridicules McCain for casting a thumbs-down deciding vote on repealing the Affordable Care Act. Petty. Pathetic. I have always thought it would take ten years to recover from the George Bush Recession of 2007 and his 2003 invasion of Iraq. That recovery is way behind schedule. We have reached the point where straight, white, cisgender men will most likely not remain the privileged group they have been for hundreds of years. Today only 31 percent of Americans are white men, and perhaps 10 percent of them are members of the LBGTQ community. How this majority is going to govern in the future is open to question. This organization publishes its findings in a publication called Cliodynamics: The Journal of Theoretical and Mathematical History. We now have 65 percent of Americans reporting they are living paycheck to paycheck. No wonder democratic socialism as the governing philosophy of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark is attractive to 61 percent of American millennial Democrats between 18 and 34, an absolutely shocking shift from capitalism in just a few years. These countries always top off happiness and equality polls of over 190 countries. In just one year membership in the Democratic Socialists of America has gone from 6,000 to 43,000. American Capitalists Are Doing A Great Job Creating American Socialists The Gallup Poll has not measured interest in socialism vs. capitalism in the U.S. for a decade, but in 2010 Democrats aged 18 to 34 had a 53 percent approval rating for both socialism and capitalism. Young Republicans in 2010 had a 72 percent approval rating for capitalism and only a 17 percent approval rating for socialism. By 2018 there has been a significant shift in ratings. Among Republicans aged 60 to 64, 60 percent approve of capitalism and 30 percent have a positive view of socialism. Even Republicans are beginning to recognize that capitalism does not work well for every American. In fact, capitalism has delivered world-record wealth to the top 20 percent while making 600,000 Americans homeless and essentially destroying the middle class, Many millions cannot afford even basic necessities. outlines several reasons why American capitalists are now the ones creating American socialists by the millions. Although about four million Americans lost homes and ended up sleeping in cars, not a single banker has heard the clang of a jail cell door. The Best and Worst of America Los Angeles represents the best and worst of America. Often called the wealthiest country in the world, we will lose 72,000 people by drug overdoses this year, kill 97 people a day with firearms, shoot eight children a day, and walk around 600,000 homeless Americans sleeping in shelters, under bridges, and in tiny tents in parks and on sidewalks. making a good profit. Our capitalists have not figured out how to stop creating socialists yet. Most of the Scandinavian and European countries solved that problem decades ago. Years ago our capitalists invested in infrastructure, education, scientific research, and regional development. Now capitalists invest huge tax cuts in stock buybacks to increase CEO and stockholder dividends. Bankruptcy for the Old in an Economy Making the Rich Richer Trump says the economy is going great. Because older Americans are facing retirement with insufficient funds and are going bankrupt at an ever-increasing rate. They are waiting longer for full Social Security benefits, solid old-time pensions have been replaced by shaky 401(k) plans, and health care costs are increasing exponentially. One in three older people who receive SS benefits depend upon them for 90 percent of their income. Because middle-class income has not increased for at least 30 years, the rate of people over 65 filing for bankruptcy has tripled since 1991. Something had to give. The Consumer Bankruptcy Project reports that from February 2013 to November 2016 there were 3.6 bankruptcy filers per 1,000 people aged 65 to 74; in 1991 there were only 1.2. In 2017 12.2 percent of all filers were 65 or older, up from 2.1 percent in 1991. Roughly 40 percent of people over 65 still have a home mortgage, twice as much as 65 and over homeowners in 1989. The lowest-income families led by someone 55 or older now carry the heaviest debt loads relative to their incomes. More than 13 percent have debt payments that equal more than 40 percent of their income, double what it was in 1991. The idea that women are not funny never entered my mind.

Of greatest concern is the previously mentioned December 5th eviction notice by the Army Corps of Engineers upon the Oceti Sakowin camp. Based upon all evidence to date we have good reason to believe that excessive, violent force will be used against unarmed people in winter conditions that threaten life simply through hypothermia. In our professional opinion, the Oceti Sakowin community composed of several thousand women (many of whom are pregnant) men, children, elderly, are firmly committed to remaining upon the land that was clearly outlined by Treaty laws belonging to the Lakota and Dakota peoples. We affirm that during the entire term of our service we have never seen any evidence of weapons, whether in the form of firearms or incendiary devices. If the goal is to protect health and well being, that purpose will best be served by allowing the Oceti Sakowin to remain, unmolested, in full exercise of their constitutionally protected First Amendment rights. We want to make clear that the SRM&HC is committed to fulfilling the spirit of the Geneva Convention by providing medical services to Oceti Sakowin regardless of the decisions and conditions imposed by state agencies. This decision occurs despite clear observations that designated and labeled medics are being unethically and illegally targeted by law enforcement -- once again in violation of the Geneva Conventions (Rule 25. Medical personnel exclusively assigned to medical duties must be respected and protected in all circumstances). We urge your respective agencies to prevent the alarming threat to loss of life and limb on December 5th.

He was right. He saw clearly that his pursuit of success visited countless cruelties and indignities upon himself and those around him, and that his triumph would come at unimaginable cost. He gives his mother space on the album to speak about the years she spent hiding her sexual orientation. He offers a new vision of capitalism as a tool for community uplift. Credit. But the line is nonetheless startling because it invokes the anti-Semitic canard that Jews maintain financial control of everything you see. Carter is also drawing on an old tradition of using American Jews as a model of a downtrodden people who found success in America. And of course, there were those who bristled at the comparison, such as James Baldwin. The analogy has never worked, because even at its worst moments America has generally been a haven for its Jewish immigrants and their descendants, and a place of bondage for its black residents and theirs. We know the names Leo Frank, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner; the names of black people who were killed in the South under similar circumstances are too numerous to recall without aid. American Jews simply have not, and likely never will, face the structural barriers that black Americans continue to face. You rarely hear black people suggesting that they emulate Jewish success anymore, although as the only Jew in mostly black spaces growing up, and almost always the only black Jew, I sometimes heard it, often with the same ambivalent mix of admiration and hostility with which it comes across on 4:44. But when black families began to move into the adjacent communities in the 1930s, they became one entity. Racism made Bed-Stuy, and then the government drew a red line around it. It was built to house working-class Americans and veterans, and was the childhood home of Shawn Corey Carter. That Bed-Stuy, like all of New York City and black neighborhoods all over America, was created through private racism and state discrimination, by the hands of presidents like Franklin Roosevelt and city bureaucrats like Robert Moses. That historical context is lacking from the economic nationalism of 4:44. The strip-club line is a more risque expression of the Obamaesque notion that black people would have better credit if they spent less money on vice, that they would have money to invest in gentrifying Brooklyn real estate or fine art that appreciates in value. But a lack of inspiration or motivation is not the reason that the black community suffers disproportionately from poverty, unemployment, crime, or incarceration. And so the arc that began with Reasonable Doubt comes to an end of sorts: Jay-Z was willing to exploit the unjust system that condemned him to a life of poverty to escape it; Shawn Carter the mogul believes that system can set black people free, implying his improbable success and undeniable genius could or should be imitated. Jay-Z savaged the hypocrisy and cruelty of American capitalism while mastering it; on 4:44, Carter wonders if the system might work after all. We regret the error.

Suicide Kills More American Soldiers Than Terrorism In 2014, 55 U.S. soldiers lost their lives in foreign occupations, but 269 active service members committed suicide. Almost five times as many. It gets much worse. In that same year of 2014 over 7,400 veterans took their own lives, accounting for an incredible 18 percent of all suicides even though vets make up less than 9 percent of the U.S. population. About 75 percent of the suicides were committed by veterans without VA care. 5.

This time, instead of fighting for corporate interests, I was fighting for the people. The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), or Bakken Pipeline, is a 1,172-mile oil pipeline project that will transfer crude oil across four states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. From the Bakken fields of North Dakota, the pipeline will carry in excess of 450,000 barrels per day of crude oil to Patoka, Illinois, and possibly on to Texas and near the Gulf Coast areas for refinement or export. I traveled to North Dakota to stand with the people of Standing Rock. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe has called people across this nation and around the world to prayer, action and support for efforts to stop DAPL or, as the people of Standing Rock call it, the Black Snake. They, along with over 300 other Native American tribes, realize that the pipeline will eventually leak and spill oil into their fresh water supply. A spill into the Missouri River would affect 17 million Americans downstream that depend on the river for their drinking water. The people of Standing Rock are not just fighting to save themselves, they are fighting for tens of millions of others. It encompasses struggles against climate catastrophe, a history of breaking treaties with Native Americans, attacks on the right to assemble, assaults on journalists, the militarization of police, and placing corporate profits over human rights. I traveled to Standing Rock with a small group of members from Veterans For Peace (VFP). VFP has had a continued presence at Standing Rock for months now, rotating members in and out. We were also joined by VFP members Ellen Davidson, Sam Adams, Richard Gilchrist, Martin Bates, Michael Sullivan, Ann Wright, and drone whistleblower Cian Westmoreland. The Hulk. While camping at Standing Rock (the official camp name is Oceti Sakowin; Standing Rock is the reservation), we were treated as family. Everyone called each other relatives, brother, sister, mother, grandmother and so on. Water, coffee, food, snacks, tents, clothes and various camping equipment were available to all without a price tag. The only request was for people to be unarmed and drug and alcohol free. There is virtually no cellphone service on the camp. Fellow veteran Matt Hoh and I agreed the camp was a reminder of Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) in Iraq and Afghanistan, without the mortars or rockets blowing up everywhere. After going to a few nonviolent direct action protests against the Black Snake, we realized what it actually meant to stand by the American people and fight in their interests. We suddenly had this feeling of honor, something we never had from our deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan. We know that our own government lied to us. Looking into the eyes of the police at Standing Rock, we saw ourselves. We also know now that not only is water life, as the Standing Rock Sioux continue to cry out, but water is also peace. None of us can have any peace without the basic necessities of life such as clean air and water, arable land, clothing, shelter and justice. The police were blocking peace and obstructing justice on behalf of corporations, greedy bankers and investors. They arrested the people and protected the construction equipment. We saw journalists being attacked and warrants issued for their arrests just for holding a microphone and interviewing people. We saw police forces using military-grade equipment that Matt and I used in combat zones overseas. We saw the infringement of constitutional rights such as the right to assemble. But most important, we saw Native Americans courageously continue to defend their land and people from a genocidal 500-year war against the state and corporations alike. The Sioux and the hundreds of other tribes and supporters are joining forces to fight for their right to exist. This struggle is their life, and has been for too many generations to count. At one time I thought the government, the military and police knew what they are doing and that they existed to protect us all. That myth has been shattered.

We had come to fight the Dakota Access Pipeline. But our first action was, denomination by denomination, to repudiate the Doctrine of Discovery. This Doctrine was a series of Papal Bulls which said that Christians had the right, and, indeed the blessing of the Church, to kill any non-Christians and claim possession of their lands and resources. This Doctrine was woven into US law when, in 1823 in Johnson v. McIntosh, the US Supreme Court ruled that the United States inherited the American conquest from the English.

A world where our oceans are full of life, and the marine life sings their songs. Where the air is clean, the sky is blue, the trees are green, and we are sitting in the grass picking an abundance of wildflowers and watching their seeds float in the soft, warm wind as it cradles our good intentions.

Unfortunately prayers will just have to continue from a distance. Again, it is in the best interest of the SAFETY OF ALL PEOPLE INVOLVED. So for that reason, it is good to hear of the upcoming date, December 5th, to move people back from the area of conflict. G-d helps those who help themselves. Please let me know where and when I can be of assistance to you and your proud tribe. I have already written to Our POTUS and the U. S. Corps of Engineers. Sincerely, Enid Lessne (Otchi Chornia on FB). TribalMember and Proud of it. 2 years ago Enid Lessne, first of all thank you kindly for your reply to my comments. I would like to share with you that I grew up going to a Baptist church. On a personal level I respect others spiritual beliefs. I find myself agreeing with what you say about action must be taken not just prayers. As I know very well about the story of the person at sea, stranded and was sent help in several forms yet refused it for one reason or another. Finally asking why was help not given. The answer was not something they wanted to hear. Yet it was fact. So is, actions alone. So my main priority is prayer. It gives the guidance that we all seek. However, in the end it must not be our own will but OUR CREATORS WILL ALONE. There are other personal spiritual attributes in my life, however, they will be kept to my tribe and I. As some gifts are sacred. If you sincerely care to offer your help, please feel free to contact the Standing Rock Sioux tribe on their Facebook page, their number to the offices is listed there. So the Army corps. A logistical nightmare, as the Army Corps. well knows. His silence in this matter is not golden. Mr. Obama, you should be ashamed of yourself. TribalMember and Proud of it. 2 years ago It may sound ironic but I just want to say thank you for not celebrating a day of mass genocide against my Ancestors. I did not eat on that day. Instead I watched a Native film for children and I can honestly say it moved me. I would recommend it. For not advertising to others, I will just say it is named after a girl and pronounced in their language. Stay strong Richard. Ben 2 years ago Thank you for doing what you do. Just like all other presidents. Just like all other presidents. Dr. Amy Eisenberg 2 years ago Dear President Obama We urgently request your presence at Standing Rock where peaceful and prayerful UNARMED Native American water protectors and supporters have been harmed. This violates our constitution and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The Dakota Access Pipelines is violating NEPA by not having a lawful and properly conducted SIA and EIA. Government to government consultation must be genuinely carried out according to UNDRIP, which you endorsed. Your absence amid these terrible human rights violations at Standing Rock by Morton County Police and the Dakota Access Pipeline Security and Personnel is deeply disconcerting. We voted for you. The abuses have escalated and this must be addressed urgently. This is an emergency. Native American lives matter. Please help. We need your immediate attention and presence at Standing Rock.

We live in a Native American-heavy state, so Arizona state politicians give Native American policy a little more thought, but it's still often seen as negative. ASU is home to many Native American students from various tribes, best represented by the multi-tribe American Indian Council. Data collected by New York Times and the U.S. Census Bureau. For too long, there has seemed to be longstanding apathy concerning Native Americans. I know this personally from living almost all of my life in Massachusetts, where we punished a man who advocated for infecting Native Americans with smallpox blankets by naming a town after him. On the surface, the Dakota Access Pipeline is a near-1200 mile-long oil pipeline going from North Dakota to Illinois, which would be a more cost-effective way of transporting crude oil, as opposed to shipping barrels by train. Data collected by New York Times and the U.S. Census Bureau. To Native American and environmental leaders, the project would contaminate local drinking water of Missouri River, which is the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux, a local tribe of about ten thousand with a reservation that straddles the Dakotas, as well as pass through and likely destroy Native American burial sites and sacred places. This goes with a longstanding American tradition of not caring about the people who have been here far longer than any of us. Sophia Giolitti, a freshman exploratory major, said she is very strongly against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Lehi Sanchez, of the Navajo Nation, is on a break from ASU but will return as a sociology senior. He felt so strongly in his opposition to the Pipeline, he ventured down to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota to go to the ground zero of opposition against the pipeline. Sanchez was not optimistic about the way policy was shaping up for Native Americans in the U.S. He particularly pointed to Standing Rock as well as recent alleged attempts, including Utah, to give Native American land over to private corporations. Nowadays, the vast atrocities that have occurred against the indigenous people of the Americas is finally starting to break into the public discourse, especially among Millennials. It seems like every Columbus Day, I see more and more people talk critically about our history, and facing an unwelcome truth: the U.S. committed atrocities too, ones that many say verged on genocide.

As you approach the campground, the road veers to the left and dips down past the town of Cannon Ball and then you see it: a teeming tent city nestled in the bowl of the surrounding hills. Quick-pitch tents are huddled next to giant teepees that billow out wafts of smoke from stoves within. Caravans and RVs and trucks and minivans are parked alongside each other. Horses graze in makeshift pens. And everywhere there is movement: people carrying supplies, chopping wood, raising tents, making signs, preparing food, chanting in drum circles, praying. In April, members of the tribe set up a resistance camp that eventually drew hundreds of other tribes from across North America, comprising the biggest Native American alliance in 150 years. They had come together for one purpose: to protect their land and water. Thousands of people have made this their home for months. There are schools, field kitchens, medic tents, art centers, traditional ceremonies, media headquarters and direct action training. Donations of supplies from across the country arrive on a regular basis. The sheer scale of it is striking. The police presence is also striking. As the camp grew over the summer, the governor of North Dakota declared a state of emergency. Police departments from 24 counties and 16 cities in 10 different states poured in. The National Guard followed. They deployed military-grade equipment, set up roadblocks and checkpoints on public roads and, the tribe says, clearly targeted native people and harassed them. The camps were put under continuous surveillance with low-flying planes and helicopters constantly overhead. The pipeline lies less than 800 meters to the north of the camp, behind a heavily armed barricade. What began as several tents housing two dozen people had grown into a sprawling encampment abuzz with members of 200 indigenous nations as well as thousands of non-native allies, including environmentalists, activists, students and celebrities. Standing Rock had become a symbol of resistance. And as the numbers of water protectors grew, so did the police presence confronting them. Police in full riot gear attacked with rubber bullets, beanbag rounds, tear gas, pepper spray, concussion grenades and water cannons in freezing temperatures. Hundreds were injured and nearly 600 arrested, but, despite the brutal crackdown, the protectors did not back down and the camps continued to swell in size. As the confrontation escalated, everything hinged on whether the US Army Corps of Engineers would grant Dakota Access the final permit they needed to drill under the river to complete the pipeline. This was the situation when I arrived in early November. It was the first time I had left Egypt for a significant stretch since 2011. I had mixed emotions. At times, it felt like a release, a temporary escape from the dark fog enveloping everything. Arrest, interrogation, asset freeze, travel ban, forced disappearance, prison. Our vocabulary has become laden with this dirty lexicon, our questions have no answers. Fleeing this gloom for a while felt like a guilty pleasure, a way to escape the pangs of defeat. Then in Standing Rock I saw something of Tahrir. It was unmistakably there: the clear sense of purpose; the transformative feeling of community; the fearlessness in the face of police brutality; the newfound courage; the tensions that arise from living in a shared space; the indescribable joy in being a part of something, a movement, that seems like it cannot be broken and will never end; the sheer sense of possibility; the feeling that one would never be the same again. It was inspiring. Something real and effective had been created through months of grassroots organizing, movement building and leadership from indigenous people. They had used their bodies as a form of resistance. They had a physical presence that could not be removed. They had made a stand in defense of the environment and Native American sovereignty against corporate and government power that reverberated across the country. And yet I was apprehensive. That they would lose. The reasons were well-founded. Donald Trump, a lewd, authoritarian conman, had just been elected president. Resisting a White House that holds the environment in utter disdain will be daunting. In Egypt, the government has a similar track record of exploiting natural resources, protecting private companies and trampling over indigenous rights. And then there was the weather. North Dakota winters are notoriously brutal with lows of 20 degrees below zero. Blizzards arrive that eviscerate color and lash at the skin with bitterly cold, snow-laden winds. By December, camp life at Standing Rock had become harsh. Thick snowdrifts sent cars skidding off the roads. People huddled inside their tents to try and stay warm. Daily chores became a grueling ordeal. The outdoor bustle of the tent city had quieted. Meanwhile, the state governor had ordered a mandatory evacuation by December 5. A showdown was looming. I left Standing Rock for a brief period and returned on December 4 in anticipation of the evacuation deadline. When my plane touched down in Bismarck, I heard the surprise announcement: the army said they would be denying the easement necessary for Dakota Access to cross under the river and that they would do a full environmental review and look for ways to reroute the pipeline. The atmosphere was joyous at the camp. Fireworks lit the sky amid whoops of celebration. There was a sense of vindication. They had won, at least for now. Perhaps my experience in Egypt has left me indelibly scarred, cynical, disillusioned. Maybe this was always the pattern of the world: These moments of beauty that cannot last. Maybe victory is in those moments of creation that cannot be forgotten and, in there, progress is painstakingly forged. Trudging through the snow, talking to tribal elders and young activists, I was told that the battle was not over, that native people were determined to stay at the camp and continue the fight. We left Tahrir too early. More questions that have no answer. In 2011, there was a giddying sense of possibility in Tahrir. That was what I glimpsed at Standing Rock. There is something uniquely liberating about carving out these shared spaces of dissent. A weight is shed. Mass mobilization and the simple assertion of physical presence is not only a form of resistance but of transformation. Even if the gains are reversed, these types of protests can crack open a window into a different world and profoundly alter those who take part. In Egypt, we ultimately lost, but we were not wrong to go out. Back then, there was no other way to be."}, {"URL": "https://act.credoaction.com/sign/Standing_Rock_monument?t=2&akid=20731.8400717.qKvWCS", "Timestamp": "20180919004128", "Sentences": "Credo Action Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument.

Only now are we getting some type of media coverage, but the news and media has remained silent. The point of the pipeline is to transport up to 570,000 barrels of oil daily from North Dakota to Illinois. For reference, the pipeline was going to be placed in Bismarck, North Dakota but was averted by the residents because of their concern of having clean drinking water. Now, Bismarck's population is predominantly white, so the fact that their needs were heard without hesitation and accommodated almost immediately boggles my mind, but I digress. A vast amount of Natives in North Dakota have resided in this reservation for many years, and the Missouri River is the only source of water that they have in their surroundings. The Pipeline is supposed to be run under the Missouri River, which is their main source of water and if DAPL is moved forward, there will eventually be a leak. Even the highest quality pipeline will eventually burst, creating pollution for the Natives that use this river as their main, if not only, source of water. Along with that, this pipeline work is supposed to be constructed in sacred burial grounds. Natives have become angered with this controversial happening and have taken this situation into their own hands. They are asking for allies to stand with them in solidarity and battle the demons of government greed. Natives have felt the burn and still remain as peaceful people, tolerating no violence on their part and living up to the standard of a truly peaceful protest. Many protesters have claimed that there have been aggressive and semi-violent approaches from the police force using K9 dogs as a form of intimidation. We can write to congressmen about the Standing Rock issue or make donations to the Standing Rock Tribe.

This was the day that two of President Donald Trump's most-important associates were convicted on eight counts each, and one directly implicated the president himself. Paul Manafort was Trump's campaign chairman for a few months in 2016, but the charges brought against him don't necessarily implicate Trump. However, they are incredibly important considering was is one of the most influential people in the Trump campaign and picked Mike Pence to be the vice presidential candidate. Manafort was convicted on five counts of tax fraud, two counts of bank fraud, and one count of failure to file a report of a foreign bank account. And it could have been even worse. The jury was only unanimous on eight counts while 10 counts were declared a mistrial. Michael Cohen, Trump's personal lawyer, told a judge that Trump explicitly instructed him to break campaign-finance laws by paying two women not to publicly disclose the affairs they had with Trump. Those two women are believed to be Karen McDougal, a Playboy model, and Stormy Daniels, a pornstar. Trump had an affair with both while married to his current wife, Melania. And then to no surprise, Fox News pundits spun this in the only way they know how. Sara Carter on Hannity said that the FBI and the Department of Justice are colluding as if it's some sort of deep-state conspiracy. The Republican Party has for too long let Trump get away with criminal behavior, and it's long past time to, at the very least, remove Mr. Trump from office. And then Trump should face the consequences for the crimes he has committed. Yes, Democrats have a role, too. But Republicans have control of both chambers of Congress, so they head every committee. They have the power to subpoena Trump's tax returns, which they have not. They have the power to subpoena key witnesses in their Russia investigations, which they have not. It does not seem like there is one, so for the time being we're stuck with a president who paid off two women he had an affair with in an attempt to influence a United States election. Imagine for a second that any past president had done even a fraction of what Trump has. Barack Obama got eviscerated for wearing a tan suit. If he had affairs with multiple women, then Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell would be preparing to burn him at the stake. If they won't, then Trump's enthusiastic would be more than happy to do so. For too long we've been saying that Trump is heading down a road similar to Nixon, but it's evident now that we're way past that point. Donald Trump now has incriminating evidence against him to prove he's a criminal, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is just getting started. Knowing his fragile ego, there's honestly no telling what he'll do. But it's high time Trump leaves an office he never should have entered in the first place.

No, actually, the race of the man has nothing to do with people's feelings. The people that are upset by his actions, not the color of his skin. I don't care what age, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation someone is...if we have differing opinions, then we just have differing opinions. It's as simple as that. I recently came across a story of the white cop that was off duty when she entered her black neighbor's apartment thinking it was her own. Then, she shot him thinking he had broken into her apartment. After this story came out, I saw a picture surface of her posing with this man that she shot. Maybe there was an altercation, maybe she wrongly shot him, but there's no reason for everyone to just assume she did it out of racism. I've said it before and I'll say it again...there is always going to be a bad apple in the bunch, but not everyone is racist. Just because there is one racist cop, one racist white person, one racist black person, one racist in politics...that does not in any way mean that every person is that way. Some people think this way, but not everyone does. It all comes down to respect with me. If you respect me, I'll respect you.

One woman nearly had her arm blown off. Others were hospitalized for hypothermia. Even prior to that, deputies shipped in from the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office had swung batons to hit protesters in the head. Video footage of that use of force has been particularly disturbing to veterans trained in the proper use of military equipment. Some 2,000 veterans from all over the country will reinforce protesters at Standing Rock this weekend. Lucas Bratvold of Bemidji, a former Air Force staff sergeant, has been deployed to the Yokota Air Base in Japan, the Balad Air Base in Iraq, and the Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. Bratvold says when he saw reporter Erin Schrode knocked off her feet by a rubber bullet mid-interview in early November, he was furious. He believes videos from Standing Rock clearly show police mishandling their weapons by shooting nonlethal rounds at too close a range, or launching tear gas canisters headlong into crowds instead of lobbing them up into the air so the chemicals mist down. Bratvold hopes that if police and Energy Transfer guards use the same tactics against military veterans, who want to serve as human shields for the Sioux and other Native Americans protesting, the whole country will protest. Native Americans comprise 1.4 percent of the United States population, but 1.7 percent of the military. Natives serve at a higher rate than any other ethnic group. Natives are a relational people, he says. They relate to the earth and water, and name their family clans for the wildlife of their ancestral homes. The need to be a part of something bigger than themselves while defending their land makes them particularly amenable to the idea of enlisting in the military. Teasing apart the thinking of that makes it a really huge moment. In any case, Hill says his job will be to look after fellow veterans, as well as other protesters who have faced violence. Kay Carlson of St. Paul, the ride-sharing coordinator for Minnesotan veterans bound for Standing Rock, will head a roster of about 50 this weekend. Carlson left high school and enlisted at 17, spending a year in Iraq shuttling people from one camp to another while dodging IEDs. Camping in the extreme cold won't be a problem, she says, nor facing rubber bullets. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

The bank will therefore take initiative and use its position to bring about a more constructive process to find a solution to the conflict. News of the asset selloff follows the delivery of a 120,000-signature petition by Greenpeace Norway and other advocates to DNB urging it and other financiers to yank all funding for Dakota Access. We now expect DNB to also terminate its loans for the project immediately. All financial institutions with a stake in the pipeline must quickly realize that financing this project is toxic. It would be smart for them to get out ahead of the growing movement of customers looking to divest from banks that finance the destruction of our planet and ignore Indigenous rights and sovereignty. Indeed, a movement initiated in solidarity with Dakota Access Pipeline opposition and Indigenous water protectors suggests individuals withdraw money and close personal and business accounts with financiers of the project. That delay, while a definitive victory for the tribe, constitutes a double-edged sword with time quickly running low before decidedly pro-Big Oil President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. In its announcement, the Army Corps stated it would work with the Standing Rock Sioux on a timeline for that consultation, but no further statement of an agreed deadline has yet been made. Undoubtedly, the exploding grassroots campaign of solidarity with water protectors is squeezing the vise-grip on Dakota Access Pipeline investors, as police use of excessive force and gestapo-like tactics against Native Americans has conjured the specter of past atrocities against Indigenous peoples by the U.S. government. State-sponsored, corporate-approved law enforcement ferocity in this matter have soured even the apathetic to this pipeline. It appears at least doubtful the Standing Rock Sioux will see their ultimate goal of permanently halting the pipeline come to fruition; but, if the Army Corps refuses to grant the necessary easement under Nationwide Permit 12, Energy Transfer Partners would be faced with a formidable obstacle to complete Dakota Access. Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people.

And now on to more practical matters: First and foremost: Keep in mind that we are guests of Standing Rock. EVERY action taken place here will ripple out to this beautiful community and leave its affects long after we all go home. We do not need any more tension in that regard than we already have. Directions: Cannonball, ND. Type it into your GPS and choose the HWY 6 route. If you are stopped by the police, it is absolutely critical that you treat them just as you would your own family or friend group. Kicking things off with an unnecessary confrontation will immediately set the wrong tone. It is essential you do not bring aggressive energy to this camp. Make peace wherever possible. In general.

These are very real and present threats when engaging the front lines. We will be updating as we can, as necessary, so check back in periodically). Most of the following suggestions are for equipment that is originally intended for a different purpose. As such, they may provide some protection, but you cannot rely on them for your safety. Use at your own risk. Clearly, a personal first aid kit would serve you WELL. Come with something small, containing cotton gauze, bandages, swabs, disinfectant, earplugs, and saline. Emergency blankets can be lifesavers in these current conditions. People are divided as to whether antacids help neutralize pepper spray. You decide. Chemical Tear Gas Exposure Masks: -An NBC rated gas mask is the highest level of protection. The filter will last up to 8 hrs of exposure depending on saturation levels. These must be combined with safety goggles. Both of these are not certified for the gases you may be exposed to, but they should lower your exposure. -At the bare minimum, come with well-fitted swimming goggles, and if they have anti-fog holes (most do) you will need to glue these closed (epoxy is good). Pair them with a disposable mask such as this. -Dust masks are a last resort. Projectiles It is not wise to look militarized in any way. You do not want to give the police a reason to start using live ammunition. Protect your body in the most discrete way possible. Rubber bullets, projectiles, etc., can kill if you get hit in a vulnerable area. For the head: -Bring a bicycle helmet with limited ventilation holes. -Any sport helmet like this will provide some protection. For your ears: Get the best you can afford. It is unclear what exactly can protect you from the Low Range sound emitting devices. It is thought gun-range ear muffs combined with highest rated ear plugs (NRR33) is the optimal protection. At least come with the ear plugs. For your torso: -Some low-key body armor worn under a jacket can be a life saver. There are some good products designed for motocross and martial arts which may give you some protection. -High-end option: Leatt does some high quality minimalist body protection. -A hard shell option is this. For the knees: Any hard-shell knee pads used in sports may prevent you getting kneecapped. As stated before, we will be updating this list as our knowledge expands. Bottom line: Come. We need you.

Around the globe, land has become gold-standard currency. As a result, Indigenous and other land-based peoples face threats to the natural commons on which they live, produce food and sustain community, culture and cosmovision. RELATED: Corporate Conquistadors Rape Indigenous Lands and Bodies In some places, organized Indigenous movements have stood up and fought off extraction and corporate development, winning protection of waters, forests, territories and more. In most places, the resistance has been met with assassination and violent repression by state security forces and corporate-financed hit squads. Two of the fiercest Native battles in the Americas today are closely connected. They are led by the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota and by the Lenca people in Honduras, organized through the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras (COPINH). Both are hard at work defending their territories and waters from further theft and desecration: At Standing Rock they are struggling against an oil pipeline being laid under their ancestral Missouri River, which they use for ceremony, drinking water and sustaining other life; on Lenca lands they are resisting the damming of their ancestral Gualcarque and other rivers. In both cases, the movements face enormous stakes. So they are challenging the power on top with shared strategies of mass mobilization and direct action. They both have the capacity to inspire the world, as seen by an outpouring of active solidarity with their uprisings from around the globe. Each is enduring tremendous assault. Standing Rock Water Protectors have suffered dog attacks, water cannons in sub-freezing temperatures, rubber bullets and tear gas. Twenty-one-year-old activist Sophia Wilansky risks amputation of her arm after being hit by what witnesses claim was a concussion grenade. Vanessa Dundon may lose permanent sight in one eye after being hit with a tear gas canister. Red Fawn Fallis is in prison, facing a trumped-up federal charge. More than 500 others have been arrested. Gomez himself has survived three assassination attempts and been beaten by soldiers twice since March. The Standing Rock Sioux and the Lenca, moreover, each claim one of the greatest leaders for Native autonomy and territory in their country. Sitting Bull (c. 1831-90) and Lempira (d. 1537) were powerful spiritual and military leaders who fought back conquest by Americans and Spanish, respectively. On the gentle North Dakotan hills -- recently covered with yellow-brown grasses, now buried in white snow -- where thousands of Water Protectors are convened, we talked with Native people about their counterparts in Honduras. All felt their lives, stories and fates reflected in their Honduran counterparts. Nathan (pictured at the top of this article) is from Nebraska, though now Standing Rock is his only home. He is a Native children's advocate and works at the school for the children living in the camp. That would be a blessing. To help those on the front lines turn the tide, we must all stand with Standing Rock. Call banks that have invested in the Dakota Access pipeline and urge them to pull their funds. Look for more ways to lend support here. The best way to turn the tide in Honduras is to cut US military aid to the government, which runs the most dangerous country in the world in which to be an environmental defender. Keep up-to-date here. With so much at stake for humanity and Mother Earth, it's time for us all to follow the lead of those in Standing Rock and Honduras, and stand, resist and act fearlessly.

Thompson, 30, took his first step on July 12 during a live feed with Myron Dewey, owner of Digital Smoke Signals, promising information pertaining to security work along the Dakota Access Pipeline. Thompson was on his way to photograph burning trucks, he said, property he was charged to protect, when he was run off the road by another vehicle. He fled, AR-15 in hand, toward a nearby pond where Nastacio and two others approached him. The decision to speak out was not taken lightly, he said. Tensions were high. There are two sides to it: Pro-DAPL and No-DAPL. A friend introduced Thompson to the security company in August 2016, and when he began working, TigerSwan was already firmly in command of all security companies involved. TigerSwan operatives led the daily briefings, which were attended by law enforcement, and coordinated intelligence reports. As a former veteran, serving three tours in the Middle East, Thompson received an honorable discharge in 2013 as a sergeant. Native Americans call Thompson War Eagle, for being a veteran and a warrior. Thompson and Dockter broke up shortly after he was arrested on domestic abuse and drug paraphernalia charges last April. He also quit his job with Leighton Security Services the same month. For approximately three more months, Thompson and Dockter remained apart, but recently patched their relationship, admitting drugs had no more room in their relationship. I was more worried about our guys getting surrounded, or overtaken by protesters. Thompson had at least two-dozen employees he oversaw, he said. Never once did he train with TigerSwan or the North Dakota National Guard. His daily routine included driving between construction sites, relaying information, scheduling, and ensuring construction workers were brought to safety, he said. Soon after the October 27 incident with Nastacio, Thompson was involved in an argument with a TigerSwan operative, he said. Leighton Security Services is an active private security company based out of Texas. Kevin Mayberry, the owner and president, feels confident his company left as good an impression as possible on locals and Standing Rock leadership and activists. Leighton Security Services was subcontracted to EH Investigations and two other companies along the Dakota Access Pipeline. He once received an anonymous email from someone claiming to be a TigerSwan employee who leaked that the international security company was actively trying to sabotage other security companies in the area and shift blame, Mayberry said. TigerSwan, its founder James Reese, and EH Investigations currently face civil lawsuits filed by the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board, a governor-appointed committee that licenses and regulates private security industries in North Dakota. When called to a site that included activists, Mayberry said that Standing Rock leaders and activists showed him and his company respect. When asked about illegal tactics used by TigerSwan or other security companies, Thompson said he needed to wait to testify in court. Intelligence reports were an integral component of daily security briefings he attended. He has only one regret, he said. He is quietly confident, answering questions briefly but succinctly.

Native Americans saved the lives of newly arrived Europeans in what is now Massachusetts, by sharing their harvest in the winter of 1620. The Wampanoag, who had lived in the region for some 12,000 years, taught the settlers to grow native crops. The Wampanoag were not the only tribe to be generous. In the earliest days, many tribes throughout the Americas helped new settlers survive. Today, many of the foods in our diet were first cultivated by Native Americans, including many on the traditional Thanksgiving table: potatoes, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, beans, corn, squash, pumpkin, and cranberry. The turkey many enjoy on Thanksgiving Day was first domesticated by Native Americans. SPONSORED The idyllic traditional story of the first Thanksgiving in which the settlers shared with the native people is largely a myth. Tragically and shamefully, what followed the European arrival was 500 years of genocide and betrayal of Native Americans. To this day, treaties are being broken for the benefit of white expansionism. If successful in eventually reaching refineries on the Gulf and East coasts, the project will become the source of carbon emissions equivalent to nearly 30 coal plants every year for the next 20 to 30 years. The Standing Rock Sioux, joined by native people belonging to some 300 tribes from across the Americas, are camped along the Missouri River to protect their water, land and way of life. The natives call themselves protectors, and are risking their own safety and comfort to nonviolently stand up to corporate control and the militarism of armed police in riot gear. The protectors say they are working for a healthy future for all of our children and grandchildren, including those of the pipeline workers and police officers. Yet again, Native Americans are leading us toward our survival. We advocate for localized, small-scale renewable energy production. A localized economy will not only decrease the power of large corporations and cut down on the carbons of long-distance shipping, but will also make our communities more resilient and self-reliant as we face the threats of climate change. At the same time, decentralizing our economy spreads business ownership and wealth more broadly and creates meaningful local jobs, building a more just and sustainable economy. As our country suffers divisions following the elections, now is an important time to stand together and become the America we are meant to be. Standing Rock is a call to all of us to protect what we love. A Lakota prophecy speaks of a black snake crossing the land, bringing with it destruction and devastation. The black snake is finally here, in the form of an oil pipeline inching toward the Missouri River. The black snake is part of a larger monster driven by greed, destroying all of life in its path and even devouring the children of tomorrow.

A man in fatigues and gun drawn gave us directions to turn around to and take highway 6 to 24 to get to the casino where we were staying; an hour and a half detour. We counted at least 45 Sheriff vehicles that sped past us on the pitch black two lane road. Show Full Text Due to our delayed arrival, the casino gave away our room. The wait list was 45 people deep. A friend had told us that the rooms were being bought up by the company that owns the NDPL. When we arrived at the camp, we found out the blockade we had encountered the day before was literally a few hundred feet from the camp. When people ask me if it was what I had expected, I tell them I was not surprised by the militarized police or the helicopters and planes circling the camp. What had surprised me was the sheer scope of the thing. There are easily over thousand people there cycling in and out. More before it got cold. A man on a P.A. calls out constant announcements. The medical bay has a chiropractor, herbalist, midwife, acupuncturist, therapist, and chemical weapons decom. The media tent sits on top of the only hill that gets cell phone reception, next to that is the legal tent. There are daily trainings on codes of conduct, and what will be happening that day in camp. Down the road from that a coat share where you can get winter clothes. I was never asked for anything. The north hills are scorched black. A fire was set just right so it would catch the wind and spread. Flood lights just to the right of that. Men on top of hills just outside of camp. There are groups of men that act as security for the camp, others that ride horses and patrol the area. I walked pass them breaking a horse in camp. I noticed one of the security guys was wearing a camera tucked in his vest. I got back to the hotel room, and put on the local news. The next day we followed an action into Bismarck. The helicopter and plane followed the convoy the whole way there. We drove very carefully not to give the police any excuse to pull us over. There was a line of police in riot gear in front of the Wells Fargo bank. The march was up the street. They were preemptively protecting the bank. A young man was singled out and arrested. They put a bag over his head, an officer on scene said it was a spit guard. The protest moved to the federal building. The anti protesters followed. The demonstration ended. I witnessed no protestor disobeying the law. The next morning the temperature dropped. The scramble to winterize expedited. More tee-pees and permanent structures were going up all over camp. There was a march toward the blockade. Many people dressed in red and sat in formation to spell out her name on the river bank. There was some stirring across the bridge. An officer with an MRAD and a riot patrol truck came and left. Two days later there was massive violence against the protesters. At camp, I heard a story about a young man who was building stone stoves to heat the structures there. His response was, he was the only person that knew how to install them and that if they wanted to last the winter, he needed to be there."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/249529074t?referring_akid=.2291924.nb0aHp", "Timestamp": "20180919005324", "Sentences": "Credo Action Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument.

Don't come for Kanye. Y'all are not going to dehumanized that black man. And I'm saying y'all because I'm talking to you specifically and white people in general because white people been making me mad lately (aka Trump is going to be our president and y'all did that shit). So rethink this shit. On one hand this meme wants us to feel sorry for one person and not the other. In a world where racism did not exist this meme would not be problematic, however, we do not live in such a world nor do we live in a post racial world. It is our cultural history that the experiences of black people are less important that those of white people. Subtly that is exactly what this meme is saying. In this day and age racism at its worst is subtle unconscious racism that is overlooked and is seemingly harmless. When racism can be perpetuated and only marginalized people can feel or notice it then we know racism goes much deeper than lynchings and burning crosses. That is the world we live in today. We live in a world where well intended white liberals can perpetuate racism just as much as the KKK without ever recognizing it. I have no idea what Kanye West is dealing with in his life but I do know the life of a celebrity is a difficult one, so I feel for him. A suicide that seemed to do with how dark and lonely the life of a celebrity can be despite it the positive ideas we associate fame and fortune with. I imagine Kanye West knows a lot of about the dark sides of fame and fortune. We need to discuss this violence because it is an issue. Both of these stories deserve coverage but for different reasons. To assume we can have one story and not the other or that one story is more important that the other seems outlandish. Two of the three people who posted the meme replied to me. Here is the first conversation that ensued. I will call the first person Ted. He needs to take care and time for himself for his mental health. I just have never appreciated him or the way he handles himself at all. I don't know what else has been spewed about him and his mental health, I simply haven't viewed much. To me, this is more about people highlighting things that shouldn't. In the news shouldn't be his mental health; that's something he deserves to take care of in private without stigma. The media should be covering the situation with the pipeline more. And I was not a part of the white America that voted Trump. Jordan (me): You don't have to appreciate that man or how he handles himself but he is a prime example of how black men are turned into monsters because we don't appreciate or like how they carry themselves. We have no idea what its like to live his life or know what he has been through so let him live. If you want to highlight the media's failure to properly do their job choose a scapegoat who does not fall into the category of a historically marginalized person. Don't use Kanye to highlight whatever wrongs may exist in the world. Sorry about the Trump comment. White America has me on the edge and its not fair to take that out on you. Jordan: We definitely can but It would be important to do so objectively. And the behavior of black people in this country is too often laced with our history of racism. Ted: Definitely. I'm sure, even as much as I wouldn't want to admit it, that even my disgruntled attitude with him is tied to that, because let's face it, racism is latent and viciously good at hiding. Jordan: This is true. These are the things I'd like us to think about especially during these trying times. The target is the media which constantly ignores the real issues in america. Racism included. They ignore the real pain of many of our recent tragedies and focus on ratings, they ignore the real issues of the presidential election and focus on the slanderous bullshit that keeps the sheeple upset at each other so they won't unite and be one instead of being mad at each other for beliefs and skin color. This is NOT about Kayne, this is pointing out an America that is not free, where we are all being controlled, and the hatred and violence toward the black community is an extremely bad part of a larger problem. Jordan: If this isn't about Kanye then don't use him to make your point. If you want to criticize the media do that but leave Kanye out of it. Using Kanye (which this meme directly does) to criticize the media is just another part of the hatred and violence aimed at the black people Matt: This is the kind of reaction that the oppressive american system is trying to get out of you. Go ahead and be upset, widen the divide and see where that gets any of us. And honestly, the media should be criticized. They leave out so much, including, as I said, any of the real pain the black community is facing Jordan: To the first comment: Don't be a patronizing white man. Its not cute. I am upset and its not fair to take that out on you because that is definitely apart of where I was coming from with my comment. So as far as that goes I apologize. To the second comment: If you want to criticize the media do that. It is important, however, don't criticize the media by diminishing someone else's experience especially when that someone is apart of a community that is dehumanized on a daily basis by the media. To the third comment: This meme in no ways shed lights on how the media ignores or stigmatizes mental health issues or Kanye's privacy. This meme was meant to do something and its execution is poor and perpetuates the very issues you want to believe it is speaking to. If you really want to be about this life consider how this meme is problematic in that it juxtaposes a black man we love to hate and a white woman we want to praise for her good work. Matt: I think you have me confused as well as what the world our media and how social constructs have formed us to interpret events in ways that deliberately drive us apart. All of your assumptions have negative connotations because they include a black person, posted by a white person. You are inclined to assume that I have no respect for what this person means to you or the serious problems he is facing, because he is black. It's not there, it's all hatred and media misportrayal. There are people fabricating evidence of white racism towards black people just to make them angier, to widen the divide between us. The lack of humanity displayed in both of the issues in both parts of these memes are two parts of a larger issue, previously outlined in the questions i have posed previously. They are not meant to belittle one group over another, and nor should they, but rather to highlight a disease of hatred in our country that will continue to prevent us from communicating effectively and getting along unless we all unite, arguing over whose problems are worse has the opposite effect. Jordan: I wouldn't dare argue with you about what this is all about. So no worries there. Fine lets disregard the color of the people in the meme. Yes. There is no real basis for the notions we have about people's skin color but we can't start there because we do live in a society where those notions are deeply ingrained into every aspect of our culture. If we want to move pass those false notions at the very least we need to acknowledge that they exist because we've created them and examine how they managed to gain traction as well as how we perpetuate those notions. Those may be the intentions of this meme but its poorly done. That is arguing over whose problems are worse. Unfortunately this is something that is effecting us all, although not in the same way. Once the dusted settled and I reread them I took note of a few things that stood out to me. For me that feels like an important place to start when white people and black people talk about race. The truth of it is every American is effected by racism. The reality is all white people are racist. During my conversation with Matt I felt like he was being condescending and patronizing which may be the most ironic thing when a black woman and a white man are talking about race. He even encouraged me to be angry and to continue to allow this to divide us. A key component to moving towards eradicating racism is shifting power. Marginalized people need to be empowered and white people need to give up some of their power. In this context that looks like Matt giving up the idea that he knows everything and sees the full picture as it truly is. In conversations of race when white people dismiss the experience of a marginalized person or tell them they are apart of the problem they are in turn perpetuating racism. Sometimes white people need to step back and listen when marginalized people are talking about race and other forms of oppression much like women often express their desire for men to take a back seat in conversations about reproductive rights and contraceptive rights. They do, however, have to be mindful of what they say and how they say it as well as being open to the possibility that they will say something racist. That is the unfortunate reality of it much like it is the unfortunate reality that marginalized people experience social and systematic discrimination on a daily basis and have to maneuver a world that is such. If we did that with every social ill we face we would run in circles and never change anything. I also had to take a moment to apologize to Ted and Matt for yelling at them about President elect Trump. That felt like the kind of language and behavior that divides us and prevents us from having conversations. Ted called me out on it and I appreciated it. 0 Comments Leave a Reply.

September 4th, Dakota Access begins clearing ground for the pipeline, bulldozing over sacred sites and burials. Protesters are attacked by dogs and pepper sprayed. It took just under two weeks for Aurelio Villa Luna Diaz, Mark Sebastian Jordan, Kathy Fetzer-Goodwin to bring this event into the public eye, being touted in the local papers and drawing over a hundred contributors and participants. It even received threats, though none came to fruition. The K.E. McCarthy building was donated as a space for the show and by door time, all money spent on food, drink, and entrance would be sent to the Oceti Sakowin Camp. Mark Jordan opens the show as MC and performer and along with Jason Kauffman, Lucas Hargis, and Nate Weiland presents a spoken word piece (Pronouncement: An Invocation for the Standing Rock Benefit Concert). This becomes the theme of the show, the different voices no longer silenced, but calling for an end to injustice. This is a shout for self-expression and for claiming a space in the land. The Sioux were granted this land in an 1851 treaty signed at Fort Laramie in Wyoming. When the U.S. Government tried to buy the land back, the Sioux would not accept payment. The easement granted by the U.S. Army Corps ignores this Treaty. The Morning After is the first band, a sloppy guitar and somewhat guttural, somewhat gravelly vocals, calling on a soused muse and a punk rock attitude. Jacob states his sadness at joining the military in order to fight for, to defend police brutality. She stands with a smile that convocates the absolutely mythic beauties she finds in the universe. Bill Baker gives an overview of peaceful resistance, and primes the crowd for the new fervor. Jai Marina follows adding her classically trained voice and fingerpicked guitar to the melange of speech. Where many of the artists were calm, Jason Kaufman lets the whole room know what rankles. In another poem, he blames President Obama for not halting the production of the pipeline himself. It damns, but hints at and imagines redemption. Together, their speech becomes muddled at one moment and sharp and clear and cutting in the next. However vague the metaphor, a clarity emerges that calls for interpretation and introspection. I follow, shaky-kneed, my first reading into a microphone. It was a different sound looking out from the stage. It is nothing to be afraid of, but rather, I want to do the crowd justice for their collective beauty. My speech, I must say, is timid. I hear the conversations of the crowd between my voice which seems to boom and hammer my ears from the P.A. I step down relieved to pats on the back that keep me blushing for days. Gratitude seems worth mentioning here. Great waves of it. Thunderous applause and a line of people patting each artist on the back as they leave. The beauty of this show lies not only in the performers, but the artists watching the performers, being involved in the performance. In fact, this place is filled with artists of one variety or another, some performing or showing their work, some merely respecting the spectacle, but all enamored by their peers. A young girl dances. To call it psychedelic would not do it justice. This is primal and it is cosmic. He wears a bird mask and strikes a walking stick on the ground to emphasize the important notes. The hula hoop spins in the background and listeners gather at his feet intently listening to his mythic words and emphatic voice. Sovroncourt plays next. He tells me he is singing to himself. His speech is for the listener. It is not to create the listener, to force one to listen, but to invite those willing to listen through the door. They embellish on the past, reimagining Tin Pan Alley with training in the classical and reimagining it on modern instruments. With such a complete understanding of music, The Trio plays with a wink and a nod to a hundred years of music and a sound that has not quite yet been replicated. If DAPL can go through and claim eminent domain on landowners and Native peoples on their own land, then we as sovereign nations can then declare eminent domain on our own aboriginal homeland. We are here to protect the burial sites here. The crowd dwindles and the last beers are bought, Man Made Bomb closes out the evening. They are loud, holding the stragglers in their swaying dances, keeping the sleepy alive for the last half hour. This is pretty good for a bunch of artists living at or around the poverty line. These are not the moneyed elite. These are the downtown shop owners, your baristas and bartenders, your servers and library workers. Even so, they emptied their pockets for a cause they believed in. But to hell with the money. The takeaway from the show is more than this. It is about the collective voice. In all the schisms formed by specific tastes in music and art, all the age gaps, and different visions, it is easy to forget that there are many of us who speak the same type of speeches, hope the same hopes, and believe in a better future for all beings. This is our land. It is there for us as an escape from the constant rush of life. It is a little slice of peace in the midst of almost constant war. We must protect it. Also a special thanks to Kathy Fetzer-Goodwin, Mark Jordan, Aurelio Villa Luna Diaz, and all the other donors and performers who made this show possible.

Shively was taking the unusual step of opposing Assistant Morton County State's Attorney Brian Grosinger's motion to dismiss the case against her client, Mary Redway. She wanted to go to trial on Friday. Twenty-one hours before Redway's trial, Grosinger moved to dismiss. Judge Allan Schmalenberger granted it. Redway's case closely resembles dozens of other cases from Oct. 22 that have been dismissed in recent weeks, often shortly before trial. Grosinger then re-charges the protester with a more serious offense and issues an arrest warrant. Redway, who traveled to Bismarck this week from Rhode Island to stand trial, now faces three new charges, which were filed with an arrest warrant on May 24. Shively said Grosinger never alerted her to the new case. Rather, he issued an arrest warrant, which she found by searching the court records. Grosinger did not respond to a phone and email request for comment on Thursday or Friday. On Oct. 22, several people locked themselves to Dakota Access Pipeline equipment in Morton County. In solidarity, a group of more than 200 people marched towards the site across private property. Police allege the protesters ripped survey stakes from the ground and yelled at law enforcement when they were told to leave. A total of 126 protesters were arrested and charged with criminal trespass and engaging in a riot, when police surrounded the group. Police have characterized the incident as a riot, but Redway said people thought of it more as a prayer walk or even a picnic, and some brought their dogs along. She said police used mace and batons, causing panic within the group. Many people from out-of-state have taken guilty pleas. The state has offered deals, which include no jail time and forfeiture of bond. Recently, they have also offered pretrial diversions, according to Shively. The six-person jury found Dakota Luke, 27, guilty of criminal trespass and engaging in a riot and co-defendant Emmalyne Garrett, 33, was just found guilty of criminal trespass. Jury members made up their minds in less than 20 minutes, according to Harris, who is Luke's attorney. Harris said the state argued that walking together in the group constituted participating in a riot. Both are re-charged with three new misdemeanor crimes from the same date.

As ardent veterans make their way towards Standing Rock, only one thing may be certain: it is likely that they will face off, in a non-violent manner in all likelihood, with veterans on the other side, who have left the military and joined any of the 76 police agencies working with MCSD.

These were the words of a Lakota woman at Standing Rock in early November, speaking to hundreds of clergy and people of faith who had come from all over the country to stand in solidarity with the Sioux Nation as they fight to protect their water and their sacred sites against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). I was so honored to be among those who gathered. We came at the invitation of the Reverend John Floberg, supervising Episcopal priest in Standing Rock, who, following the increasingly militarized police response to nonviolent protest there, asked clergy to come make a prayerful, peaceful witness of solidarity. His call was echoed by Chief Arvol Looking Horse, one of the Sioux spiritual leaders, asking religious leaders to come and stand side-by-side with the people there, who are themselves standing together in prayer. Rev. Floberg had hoped that 100 people would show up for this act of solidarity; more than 500 people came, from more than 20 different faith traditions. I kept having this vision of hopping into my minivan with some people from my church, pointing the car west, and just driving until we got there. When I learned of the invitation to clergy of all faiths to come make a witness to solidarity and peace, it suddenly seemed that the vision was not a mere daydream. I and others in my church dropped everything, packed our bags, and headed west. After an orientation the night we arrived, during which we heard testimony from Native American women and men, we gathered on Thursday morning around the sacred fire at Oceti Sakowin, the prayer camp near where the DAPL is being constructed. There, representatives of the various Christian traditions stood before the seven tribal elders and renounced the Christian Doctrine of Discovery, the 1493 doctrine that formed the theological justification for colonization, granting Christian explorers the right to take any land that was not already occupied by Christians. Our Baptist forebear, Roger Williams (founder of Rhode Island and of the first Baptist church in America) argued that the native people were the true owners of the land here and that the Puritans ought to repent of receiving it from the English king. Unfortunately, his was a minority viewpoint, and the European immigrants continued their colonization of the land and its people. In 1823, the U.S. Supreme Court incorporated the Doctrine of Discovery into U.S. law, laying the foundation for the ongoing subjugation of rights of indigenous peoples and the claiming and exploiting of the lands they occupied. The construction of the pipeline through tribal lands that were guaranteed by treaty is a direct result of this doctrine. We then gave copies of the doctrine to each of the tribal leaders, who burned the papers in the sacred fire. It was a powerful and holy moment, reminding all of us again of how essential confession and repentance are in the crucial work of reconciliation. Healing begins. Police donned their riot gear and a helicopter repeatedly circled low overhead. We continued to pray, to sing, and to make our peaceful witness. While the political and corporate machinations around the DAPL continue, and the outcome is currently unclear, it is very clear that the visible witness of people of faith matters. It makes a difference to those who are vulnerable for others to come alongside them in support, encouragement, prayer, and action. I have so much more to learn about the issues facing indigenous peoples as well as those facing the many other groups of people in our nation who feel threatened, dismissed, or violated. I have so much more to learn about how to engage the gospel work of confession, repentance, reconciliation, and solidarity for justice. At Standing Rock, I was reminded of what is most needed for this work: prayer and community. Oceti Sakowin is a prayer camp, and the Water Protectors at Standing Rock understand that the fight they are in is a spiritual battle that begins and ends in prayer. The gathering at Standing Rock is the largest assembly of Native Americans since the Battle of Little Big Horn. After centuries of being stripped of their land, their languages, their opportunities, their traditions, their very identity, this may be the most important victory they have claimed: the new creation of community. I went to Standing Rock to be part of an apology, to make one small effort at repenting for sins that cannot be undone, and to stand in prayer with people who are fighting for justice. I came away renewed, remembering again that the work of peace, justice, and love starts with confession, repentance, prayer, and community. My good heart goes to your good heart.

Rossi has done this before, in Missouri while working with the ACLU during the Ferguson protests. Since arriving in Standing Rock on Nov. 4, Rossi has been working with other ACLU members from North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. Singer also is a citizen of the Navajo Nation. Rossi said they have been focusing on indigenous justice in Montana and continue to prioritize it in their strategic plan at the ACLU of Montana. There is a stark contrast of police response between the armed protest that took place on federal land in Oregon compared to the response to the Native American protesters fighting for their rights on federal land in North Dakota, Rossi said. This is one red flag, among others, that pulled Rossi to Standing Rock. Seven defendants involved in the armed occupation of Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in southeastern Oregon were acquitted by a jury in late October. Meanwhile, dozens of protesters at Standing Rock have been arraigned on charges like conspiracy to commit a riot, Rossi said. Native Americans are the largest nonwhite population in Montana, and there's a history of discrimination in the state, Rossi said. Montanans also care about their environment and the sanctity of their land, Rossi said, citing the state's Constitution. Montanans depend on natural resources industries, but there needs to be more consultation with tribes when it comes to these issues, Rossi said. Click any reaction to login.

TOM STROMME, TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Two pipeline protesters were convicted Tuesday of misdemeanors in the first Dakota Access-related jury trial in Morton County. On Monday, a 10-person trial was postponed after a judge learned some evidence had not been provided to the defense attorneys. Though the trial happened Tuesday, it was not without confusion and objections: Voliva first reached his defense attorney, William Thomason, shortly before trial and showed up seemingly unexpected in the courtroom midway through a 9 a.m. pretrial hearing. Kent Morrow, representing Shapiro, speculated that he was missing a key police report. Voliva is a part-Yupik retiree and artist who said he protested a pipeline in Alaska when he was younger. Shapiro is a teacher and farmer. Both said they worried about potential environmental consequences of the pipeline. Two other men arrested in the same incident were supposed to go to trial Tuesday, as well; but one did not have an attorney and was not in court. The other is in California and reached his attorney, Bob Quick, this past weekend, according to Quick. No representative of the Morton County State's Attorney's Office appeared at the pretrial hearing to respond to the objections, and South Central District Judge Bruce Romanick was determined to proceed. Jury selection Prosecutors and defense attorneys have expressed concern in recent days over their ability to find a fair six-person jury in Morton County. Their worries were reflected in questions asked by the judge and attorneys during the selection process. One man, who said he was in stopped traffic due to this protest, was quickly excused. Other potential jurors who did not make the final panel included a Mandan city commissioner, a man with family in law enforcement and the pipeline industry, and a man who said he records protests around Bismarck-Mandan for Facebook. Among the jurors serving were a homemaker, a pharmacist, a construction worker and an antiques dealer, who all said they could be fair. Trial The evidence presented at trial consisted of testimony of three law enforcement officers who were on N.D. Highway 6 that day. Mercer County Sheriff Dean Danzeisen, who was assisting Morton County, said he looked through binoculars and saw the car containing the defendants, who were masked, pull into the intersection of Highway 6 and County Road 135 south of St. Anthony so that a convoy of protesters could proceed without stopping. He said the men got out of the car. At least one car was stuck directly behind the protesters and another went around them, he said. Not mentioned in court was that a protest was staged that day along Highway 6 at a pipeline construction site. The defense attorneys countered that the state's case jumped to too many conclusions. And they just made some assumptions. Romanick gave them 10-day suspended sentences, meaning they will serve no jail time if they successfully complete a year on unsupervised probation. The prosecutor told the judge in court he intended to seek a hearing for reimbursement after the trial, because he contends the protesters are seeking to do economic harm to Morton County through their arrests.

Minnesota has struggled struggled with its own extremist political movement. Raising fines for illegal protest activity is all well and good, but holding people who organize and perpetrate illegal protests financially liable for the mayhem they cause is a better way to address the problem. Opponents of the legislation are, of course, claiming that it intends to silence protest. But illegal protests are, you know, illegal. Those who use the tactic should be held responsible, but using the criminal code to address the situation can be tricky. Allowing for a civil remedy, on the other hand, makes much more sense.

They asked me where they should sleep. I looked around, not knowing what, if anything, I should say. I asked, with that disappointed tone that I learned from my mother. To be fair, I had been to North Dakota once, in the summertime, and I had no idea just how bad it was going to be in winter. In winter, during a blizzard. My climatological education would be furthered to learn that it is the wind that makes North Dakota so treacherous. It apparently starts in South Dakota, moves south, speeds up, and stops at nothing, picking up all the cold from both poles before it hits North Dakota. It will knock you over, that is no hyperbole. These three kids had no idea. That was my first night, December 2nd, at Oceti Sakowin, and only my first of many encounters with a relentlessly understanding and accepting culture. They were all different types of people, yet similar in their motivation for change. A military veteran joins the Standing Rock during the Veteran Stand weekend. Over the last month, Oceti Sakowin and its people have been on my mind constantly. Standing Rock was a mind-blowing amalgam of all different types of people, from all cultures, economic statuses, religions, political ideologies, gender identities, and tribes. No two people there would have the same answer as to why they were there. Some folks I met lived there, born and raised on the Standing Rock Reservation. Some were there for Native American rights. The environmental cohort was strong. There were also factions of peaceful green protestors, promoting things like divestment and commercial abstinence from non-green companies. I ran into folks who were against the government interfering with capitalism. There were anarchists. There were capitalists. There were people there who had no political or social ideologies at all, but were there to protect civilians peacefully protesting. That is only a start, because there is no possible way to describe it, but it speaks to the overwhelming nuance of the group at Oceti Sakowin. But it is important to acknowledge the nuance in order to weave a single narrative out of so many different voices. My little thread of voice in this narrative rug began several months ago. I was considering driving out to Standing Rock as soon as I heard about it, in maybe September. I talked about going out there with my dreadlock-sporting musician friend. I was hesitant, for many reasons, but mostly because of an article I read which reported white people had moved into camp in throngs and turned it into another Burning Man-esque music festival. My own Native American blood is thin, my inner environmentalist is morally defeated, and my inner anarchist is too afraid of life without cable. My older sister sent me a link regarding Veterans Stand for Standing Rock and their crowd-sourced donation page. I found out that a local woman specifically asked for the help of veterans. I also learned Native Americans represent the largest percentage of any cultural group to serve in the military. I immediately started packing, all I needed was someone to ask me to come. I was activated by a mission, a call for help, and brothers and sisters in distress, as veterans are wont to be. I talk less in hopes for someone else to start talking, but it took me awhile to get to this point where I can talk less but still act. All these groups had their own motivations and they seemed to be just as compelled to be there to support their individual causes. Despite, or maybe in spite, all these disparate ideologies, Standing Rock worked. There were reports of 12,000 people at camp on December 5th . Rumors said there were 600 indigenous tribes present, that it was the largest meeting of Native Americans ever. Rumors said every continent was represented. There were two things that held that many different people together. The mission and the wind. There was one clear mission, set forth by elders and reservation leaders: have the Army Corps of Engineers re-evaluate their decision regarding construction of the pipeline under Lake Oahe. I was asked to march with the elders during their prayer ceremony on the bridge because I was a medic in the Army. As far as I could tell, there were no media or non-natives on the bridge during the prayer. It was a beautiful and incredibly impactful thing to witness. There were three of us medics on the bridge with the elders and medicine women and Akitchita, and several hundred Native Americans on the road behind them. In the middle of the elders was a Contrary. A Contrary is a type of inherited social position in the tribe, a teacher and warrior, who does everything backwards. They would ride into battle on their horses backwards. You greet them with your back to them. You kick dirt on them or throw cigarettes at them when you walk by them. Their role is to make people think about what has become status quo in society. The Contrary and I had a cup of tea after the prayer ceremony while we warmed ourselves. The Akitchita were on horseback. The Akitchita are appointed protectors of the Sioux people for a specific duration of time. The women smudged us and the elders prayed in celebration of their long awaited accomplishment. It was a moment I will never forget. And then my feet froze solid. Once the blizzard started, and it came up quickly and without forgiveness, it became a struggle for survival. It was 20 below with 45 MPH winds. If you were standing outside, you were likely to get knocked down and dragged a bit across the frozen ground. There were throngs of people at Oceti Sakowin who were not prepared at all for the extreme weather, for one reason or another. The medics did all we could for as many as we could. Our duties as medics mostly came down to just calming people and keeping them warm. There was one hairy moment when a tent started on fire and we had to get everyone out, and then find the 30 or so new lodging before they got cold. But again, it worked. No one died. Everyone came together and came out alive and most were feeling good after the blizzard was over. When survival is on line, and there is a true danger, people come together and get things done. They make it happen. And they will continue to make it happen. The blizzard was a physical threat, but I feel it is a great analogy to any other threat, be it social, like infringement on human rights, or economic, like the widening class gap. I try not to bring it up or talk about it unless asked, and then all I do is address that specific question or comment as briefly as possible. Because I learned that no matter what I say, my point is lost. With people who lean right, the conversation is about the supposed permanence of fossil fuel infrastructure and capitalist society. I try to bring up that there were a great many political ideologies represented at the protests, including Libertarian and New Republicanism. Many protestors were blue collar heroes, trying not to become forgotten in an ever-progressing technological world that seems to be leaving them behind. With people who lean left, the conversation derails into conspiratorial terrain pretty quickly. I was at a party right after I came back home, and I was asked if I was at Standing Rock. I said that that was not true, and I was promptly corrected, being that this person happened to read something on social media about it. This has happened several times, in several different conversations, so I stopped talking about it. That is a lesson I learned from my military service. People truly want to believe whatever they already believe. Whatever we were, and whatever we are now as veterans, whatever we do in our other lives, we can talk less, and act more. We can act by letting other people talk, and protecting their right to talk. When we act, we should chose our battles wisely. We should assess, determine the threat, and develop a clear mission. And we should come prepared. Application has been deleted. Type: OAuthException Code: 190 Please refer to our Error Message Reference.

In addition to these shady deals and intimidation tactics, the report also highlighted numerous problems caused by the company. Testimony from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe described how workers with ETP destroyed at least 380 sacred and cultural sites along the DAPL route. The company also hired private security firms like TigerSwan, who used excessive force and military tactics against protestors, all while operating without a license to operate in the state of North Dakota. The numbers are staggering. The website displays a map of oil pipeline spills from 2010 to present, and it is discouraging, to say the least. Clearly, the main selling point put forward by Energy Transfer Partners, and those who stand to reap billions from its construction is a lie. Put in terms of the amount of crude oil spilled, pipelines are more dangerous than rail cars or trucks. But this is not an appeal to continue relying on railroads and highways for transporting oil. The shocking data on oil spills, the threat to human health and the environment, and the assaults on the rights of landowners and Native Americans brought about by the DAPL construction point to one conclusion. Now, more than ever, we need to speed our transition away from fossil fuels and fully embrace renewable energy. The technology is there, and the free market is making great strides to make this happen. But the corporatocracy still has an enormous grip in perpetuating the oil era, as we can plainly see in the construction of DAPL and the increased oil production through fracking. The corrupt partnership of corporate behemoths and government players is keeping us mired in the era of oil, putting human and environmental health in ever greater risk with more and more pipeline construction.

Of greatest concern is the previously mentioned December 5th eviction notice by the Army Corps of Engineers upon the Oceti Sakowin camp.

And sure enough, ETP issued a furious, aggrieved press release around 11 p.m., along withsubsidiary Sunoco Logistics. As stated all along, ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way. Advertisement And so, as night fell and puddles of snow re-froze into sheets of treacherous black ice, tents and tipis stayed up. Despite temperatures threatening to drop into the single digits this week, many people seemed resolved to stay. Castaneda is an artist and photographer originally from the Salt River community near Phoenix, Arizona. He first arrived at Standing Rock in October, and stayed through most of November before returning home for a spell. He returned this week. Cunningham and a friend, social worker Kyla Ferguson, had been here since mid-November. All three noticed a sudden absence of law enforcement drones hovering over the camp on Sunday. The peace and quiet, they pointed out, coincided with an influx of media and celebrity supporters, not to mention thousands of veterans who arrived to support and defend the water protectors. All three worried that ETP and law enforcement were merely behaving themselves for now. Castaneda watched as tipis and tents were destroyed. People were sprayed with rubber bullets or dragged from where they were praying in a sweat lodge and arrested. Some 140 people were taken into custody in all. It was a scene he found hard to forget. The water protectors and veterans, he said, would go when the Standing Rock Sioux asked them to, and not a moment before. She turned back to her children.

This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline.

Her mother, Marie Carson, was a former schoolteacher, who like many women during the early 1900s gave up her career for marriage and motherhood. Though a poverty-stricken housewife, Marie was an educated woman who enjoyed reading and music and possessed an insatiable love for nature. Fortunately for mankind, that love and respect for nature was passed down to Rachel, who today is accredited for the existence of environmental protections, and the simple willingness to weigh the impacts of technology on nature. Together, the two spent entire afternoons outdoors identifying birds and insects while listening to and appreciating the sounds of nature. Carson was a solitary, yet thoughtful, young girl who greeted the birds on her way to school. At 14, Carson was selling her work to magazines. A Creative Writer Who Fell in Love With Science Marie did everything in her power to ensure Rachel received the education she longed for, but never received. Carson landed a research position at a marine laboratory in Massachusetts where she discovered the ocean and her unshakable love for the vast, unexplored body of water. It was then Carson realized that everything was interconnected, and man was not in control. Her journey into environmental activism began during World War II, a tense and fearful time in which Americans were suffering the brunt of a brutal war and infectious disease outbreaks that caused unbearable symptoms and killed millions. She realized her stories would make excellent feature pieces, and began selling them to newspapers including the Baltimore Sun. Weary about losing credibility simply because she was a woman, Carson omitted her first name from her articles. These feelings receded though, once she learned how to marry biology with writing. It painted a vivid, yet mysterious picture of a never-before-seen world. Though it received early praise, the book never hit stores and ultimately flopped as its release coincided with the bombing of Pearl Harbor. As formidable as the war itself was the massive outbreaks of typhoid fever faced by soldiers abroad and Americans at home. Crowded and unsanitary living conditions proved to be the perfect breeding ground for body lice, which carried and spread the disease. But the discovery of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) as a powerful insecticide offered hope in combating the insufferable disease, while giving man a sense of control over his environment. Acutely toxic to insects, but seemingly harmless to humans, DDT was sprayed indiscriminately abroad and at home to kill mosquitos carrying malaria, body lice and eventually agriculture pests. As shown in the film, millions of people were dusted with DDT. It was sprayed in their hair, inside their clothing and even on sleeping babies. At the time, DDT seemed like a miracle, a gift from God even. More than 4.5 million homes and 20 million acres of farmland in the southern U.S. were treated with DDT, according to the film. Dead Birds and Fish Kills Eventually biologists began seeing evidence that DDT was causing mass bird and fish kills. As a biologist for the Fish and Wildlife Services (FWS), Carson witnessed the evidence firsthand and wanted to write an article warning people about the possible dangers. Carson had no choice but to shelve the idea. The chemical was used in countless products including DDT-coated shelf paper and paints and varnishes. Meanwhile, Carson was focused on her second book. Carson had managed to take a complicated subject and relay it in an almost poetic way that both relaxed and intrigued readers. It reached the No. 1 spot, where it remained for 32 straight weeks. The development of the atomic bomb and chemicals like DDT made people feel as if they had mastered the planet. Carson, however, viewed unlimited human ingenuity as dangerous and believed that human arrogance outruns human wisdom. As the development of weapons of mass destruction continued, Carson realized humans could in fact destroy nature. By 1956, pesticide sales had increased 25 percent. It soon became evident pesticide scientists were thinking only about acute toxicity and not the long-term effects. Biologists learned that pesticides like DDT were bio-accumulating in wildlife and becoming more concentrated as they moved up the food chain. One study found that earthworms were so toxic one year after DDT exposure that they poisoned the robins feasting on them. Even more disturbing was evidence of insect resistance, which meant that birds and fish were needlessly dying while the targeted insects continued to thrive. In 1959, the U.S. government finally admitted the health hazards of nuclear fallout. Per the advice of her doctor, Carson underwent a radical mastectomy and was told that it was gone and not cancerous. But a second hard lump soon appeared, prompting her to get a second opinion from a doctor who diagnosed it as cancer. The devastating news gave Carson a newfound sense of urgency. No witchcraft. No enemy. No witchcraft, no enemy action had snuffed out life in this stricken world. The book sparked major controversy, selling 65,000 copies in less than two weeks; every newspaper in the nation reviewed it. Monsanto resorted to scare tactics, running advertisements that depicted a world overrun with infectious disease and famine. We can do dramatic things, and we can do them quickly. By the time damaging side effects are apparent, it is often too late or impossible to reverse our actions. Carson singlehandedly managed to enact a paradigm shift in the way humans view the environment. Some say there is a before and after Rachel Carson in terms of how we think about the environment. Carson believed that we as humans are not separate from this living world, but in fact are a part of it. On April 14, 1964, Carson succumbed to cancer and died at the young age of 56. The 'Silent Spring' Continues Carson rightfully questioned the logic and sanity of using such vast amounts of a chemical without knowing much about its ecological and human health impact. Her book triggered a revolution in thinking that gave birth to the modern environmental movement, and the public outcry that resulted from her book eventually led to DDT being banned for agricultural use in the U.S. in 1972. Disturbingly, some believe glyphosate may actually be WORSE than DDT, yet the U.S. government has repeatedly failed to take affirmative action to protect us from this pervasive toxin. Today, we're also exposed to even vaster amounts of pesticides, and a wider variety of them. Consider this: The very same companies that developed chemical warfare weapons during World War II simply transitioned into agriculture after the war, and many of the same warfare chemicals are now sprayed on our food. The notion that these chemicals are good for humans, the environment and the business of agriculture is a fabricated one. DDT, which is harmful even at very low levels, is also linked to male infertility, miscarriages, developmental delays, nervous system and liver damage. Modern day research proves Carson was right about her suspicions that DDT caused health effects, yet Offit and other chemical industry proponents continue to attack a woman who displayed one of the most remarkable cases of bravery our nation has ever seen.

Her friends have been arrested and subjected to what they describe as cruel and inhumane treatment. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Prairie McLaughlin, who says she was forced to strip in front of male and female guards. Native women say they are protecting the basic human right to clean water. But for some indigenous activists, the internationally recognized movement has become a larger fight against a history of misogyny, racism and abuse by law enforcement. Law enforcement officials have found that the temporary camps can lead to upticks in human trafficking, assault, rape and drug crimes. When speaking out against the Keystone XL pipeline, native leaders argued that indigenous women were sexually assaulted by non-native men at alarmingly high rates and that police have failed to prevent and prosecute these crimes when they accelerate amid an oil boom. For native women leading at Standing Rock, police disrespect of indigenous culture and women is unsurprising. But some women said they felt targeted.

She and a few others were chatting in a group message and knew they had to find a way to stop the project on the ground. In April, members of the Standing Rock Lakota and other indigenous nations rode on horseback and established the first spiritual camp. Young women leading the Standing Rock youth council have faced Mace, teargas and rubber bullets during increasingly tense standoffs with police. Several women who were arrested said they were crowded into vans and cells. Behind bars they encountered mostly native women, many who were incarcerated for what appeared to be low-level offenses. Gonzales said the jail was packed with native women incarcerated for reasons other than the pipeline actions, including one who was pregnant and feared she was having a miscarriage and another who appeared to be severely ill.

Lauren Howland, a 21-year-old youth council leader and member of the San Carlos and Jicarilla Apache tribes and Navajo Nation, said she felt that police were discriminating against indigenous people.

An AlterNet Thanksgiving classic. Our people, she said, had been here much longer and taken much better care of the land. It was enough for me to know the difference. At six, I felt I had learned something very important. When Squanto, a Wampanoag man, found them, they were in a pitiful state. He spoke English, having traveled to Europe, and took pity on them. Their English crops had failed. They had already experienced European slave traders raiding their villages for a hundred years or so, and they were wary -- but it was their way to give freely to those who had nothing. Among many of our peoples, showing that you can give without holding back is the way to earn respect. It was believed that by giving there would be enough for all -- the exact opposite of the system we live in now, which is based on selling, not giving.To the Pilgrims, and most English and European peoples, the Wampanoags were heathens, and of the Devil. They saw Squanto not as an equal but as an instrument of their God to help his chosen people, themselves.Since that initial sharing, Native American food has spread around the world. Nearly 70 percent of all crops grown today were originally cultivated by Native American peoples. I sometimes wonder what they ate in Europe before they met us. Within 20 years European disease and treachery had decimated the Wampanoags. Most diseases then came from animals that Europeans had domesticated. Cowpox from cows led to smallpox, one of the great killers of our people, spread through gifts of blankets used by infected Europeans. Some estimate that diseases accounted for a death toll reaching 90 percent in some Native American communities. The story of that heart is the real tale than needs to be told. We have seen the evil that it caused in the 350 years since. I believe it must be each of us. Indeed, when I give thanks this Thursday and I cook my native food, I will be thinking of this hidden heart and how my ancestors survived the evil it caused.Because if we can survive, with our ability to share and to give intact, then the evil and the good will that met that Thanksgiving day in the land of the Wampanoag will have come full circle.And the healing can begin.

BuzzFeed News identified more than 60 Facebook pages with more than 6 million fans that are generating money either by selling counterfeit Native American merchandise, or by driving traffic to ad-filled websites that in some cases have little or nothing to do with Native American issues. Native designers say their work is being stolen and resold, and that some pages falsely claim to donate proceeds to the protesters at Standing Rock. He said some Facebook pages have even taken photos of his models and photoshopped different clothing on them. Erica Moore with two people wearing one of her Standing Rock T-shirt designs. She said copies of her designs soon began showing up on Facebook and elsewhere. BuzzFeed News tracked some of the worst offending Facebook pages to owners in Vietnam. It promotes its T-shirts by photoshopping them on celebrities such as The Rock, Johnny Depp, Mark Wahlberg, and others. Many of its recent posts about clothing comment on the Standing Rock protest, though there is no evidence that the people running the page donate any proceeds to the protesters. BuzzFeed News messaged the page on Facebook and the person who replied introduced themselves as a woman in Michigan named Maria Torres who claims to be Native American on her Facebook profile. The profile appears to only have been created in March of this year and primarily shares merchandise being promoted by the Like If You Love Native Americans page. The account also reposts content and merchandise from a page called Wolves In Native American Culture which points to a domain name registered to the same person in Vietnam. The person then denied stealing designs from Native artists. The person said they simply find Native American T-shirts that have already been uploaded to SunFrog and collect them on one page, earning a commission each time they sell. SunFrog is one of several websites that enable anyone to to upload a design and then offer print-on-demand ordering for a range of clothing. He pointed to a form on its website that anyone can use to make a claim. He also said anyone who falsely claims to sell clothing in support of a cause will have their account closed and SunFrog will donate their earnings to charity. Yodzevicis said SunFrog has seen an increase in infringing designs and false charity claims related to Standing Rock. One of the bigger pages identified by BuzzFeed News is called Indigenous People of America and has over 750,000 fans. It shares a steady stream of news related to events in Standing Rock, but under many of its posts it also promotes the sale of a knockoff of a shirt created by actor Shailene Woodley to raise funds for Standing Rock. The only official seller of the Woodley shirt is Omaze, yet the design can be found for sale on many other online clothing sites as well as on Amazon. SunFrog removed a version of the shirt for sale on its site after being alerted to it by BuzzFeed News, though other copies of the design remain for sale on the site. Another big Facebook page hawking inauthentic Native American goods is Native American Indians, which has over 360,000 fans and promotes merchandise from a store called NativeThing.com. Once they receive their order people realize it was made in China, gives off a noxious odor, and that the company subsequently refuses to accept returns. Many other pages pursue a similar strategy of building up an audience with Native content and then trying to sell them shirts and other items that are often rip-offs of Native designs. One newer page is called I Stand with Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and shares a steady diet of news about the protest mixed with constant pleas for people to show their support by buying shirts for the cause. The page did not respond to a question about whether it donates any money to the tribe. Along with stealing the work of Native artists, and the likenesses of models and celebrities, some scammers even used a photo of the first Native American federal judge to create fake profiles to help spread their content. Her photo has been used on at least three fake Facebook profiles, one of which lists its two only friends as two young men in Kosovo. One of the largest networks of Native American Facebook pages initially identified by BuzzFeed News belonged to two young men in Kosovo. At the time of the interview, their pages had close to 2 million fans. However, after speaking to BuzzFeed News all of their pages were taken offline. where Dardan and a partner publish clickbait articles about a wide variety of topics, though rarely about Native Americans. Dardan did not respond to a subsequent Facebook message from BuzzFeed News asking why they had removed their Native American Facebook pages. BuzzDuzz is still publishing as of this writing. Some of the Native American designers who spoke to BuzzFeed News said the non-Natives running the pages and selling stolen designs are making more money than they are. Aaron Silva, a Native American and the co-founder of The NTVS clothing brand in Minnesota, said the dubious Native American sellers often have one or several large Facebook pages to use to promote the merchandise. Silva also said these pages spend money to create sponsored Facebook posts that promote the item for sale to large numbers of people. One of its current sponsored posts shows photos of Bernie Sanders and celebrities with the Shailene Woodley shirt. This sponsored post for a stolen design has received over 125,000 reactions, 15,000 comments, and close to 18,000 shares as of this writing. It had over 33,000 reactions, nearly 4,000 comments, and over 8,000 shares. These sponsored posts also help grow the number of fans for that page: When BuzzFeed News first found the Native American Cultures page roughly two weeks ago, it had just over 57,000 fans. It now has over 72,000. It has close to 12,000 reactions, just over 500 comments, and 2,100 shares as of this writing. The comment thread was soon filled with people sharing other examples of suspect pages, and of designers talking about how they too had their work stolen. Silva and others have also tried to contact T-shirt sites such as SunFrog and TeeChip to get their designs removed. They said the takedown forms and procedures take up a lot of their time. Yodzevicis from SunFrog said their reporting form has only a few fields to complete and submissions are checked roughly every hour. He also said the company is working to implement a procedure whereby any money earned from a stolen design will be sent to the original artist. Silva said Facebook is easier to deal with, but that it only removes the offending post rather than an entire page. Yazzie has also tried directly contacting the Facebook pages that promote his stolen designs for sale. But at most he says they will delete the post with his design and just upload it again later. For his part, Silva is amazed at how so many people in different parts of the world have discovered that dubious Native American Facebook pages, websites, and merchandise can be a moneymaker.

The beneficiaries of the trillions of dollars received from worker direct ownership, control, and distribution of the surplus will at first number in the millions of people and eventually in the billions after we merge the entire planet into a seamless government. Below is a sample of laws and legal actions that will ensure that citizens remain the undisputed constituents of their governments never again to be replaced by lobbyist interlopers doing the bidding of their super-rich masters in a rigged shadow government.... Health insurance profit oriented company intermediaries will be eliminated Break up, seize the assets of, and transform all big-business dictatorships into worker owned and democratically operated organizations that benefit everyone instead of a few well-connected CEOs, executives, big-investors, lobbyists, and government puppets. Break up all the banks and insurance companies transferring ownership and democratic control to the workers and the communities that they serve. This is similar to the dissolving of the corporate entity that will transfer ownership to workers and ensure democratic control of all businesses across the entire country. But where insurance and banking firms are concerned they will be more fully integrated into the communities that they serve. Communities will have greater sway over the operation of these new financial institutions than the workers. The workers of these new financial institutions will still have a hand in directing their operation but instead of receiving the full benefit of any surplus generated by these organizations they will through a democratic process work with the communities that are served to determine surplus remuneration amounts apportioned between workers and communities. Financial institutions are essential to the proper functioning of any society and therefore should never again be allowed to prey upon the general citizenry. That is why it is imperative that the communities that they serve have a fuller democratic voice in their operation and receive enhanced benefits from there effective and efficient operation. Exploitative corporate entities will cease to exist Living-breathing human beings will be preeminent under the law - no entity either business, government, or any other yet to be created societal construct will have equal or greater rights than a sentient living citizen Lobbying of any elected official in any form or fashion will be a felony punishable by anywhere from 20 years to life in prison Elected government officeholders will be limited to a maximum number of terms.

Gerrymandered voting districts will be illegal. In some places in Florida they are only 150 feet wide for many miles. Solitary confinement of prisoners is cruel and unusual punishment and will be expressly forbidden in all penitentiaries. The primary focus of prisons will be to rehabilitate convicts so they may once again reenter society as productive citizens. If found guilty they will be exiled to the Amazonian rain forest or the remotest spec of Arctic ice near Nome, Alaska. Wipe out the entire intermediary layer of profit oriented corporate parasites that feed off of the wage starved citizenry. These are middle-layer extortionists like health insurance companies that charge citizens outlandish premiums for policies not worth the paper they are written on and revenue focused hospitals and other providers that leave patients hopelessly in debt for services that are hundreds-of-times more costly than in any other developed nation. The United States government is complicit in the orchestration and enforcement of many pervasive systems of industry business pillage. Medical establishment lobbyists created a never to be rivaled system of banditry. An income strip-mining contrivance that extracts year after year many more billions of dollars from citizens who are legally required to be consumers of the medical industry. Beyond repulsive, there just is not a word that can adequately convey the dismay felt by the general citizenry that their government would sink to such a low level just to enrich a few barons in the medical industry. Providing decent healthcare is a fundamental responsibility of government. Capitalist exploitation is drowning nations and individuals in a sea of red ink. We are swirling deeper into a crimson pool of personal and government debt. What our corporate masters have created is a debt churn now in the trillions of dollars with China being the biggest creditor of this fairy tale economy. We will be able to use the trillions of dollars that was going to rich autocrats to invest in a better future. Nations with a burgeoning debt load will start paying down this debt instead of sinking further into the hole simply to pamper a tiny group of income and wealth vultures that want to build ever larger piles of loot and phantom wealth assets. The general population will have real income to purchase products and services instead of having to take on more credit card and other forms of debt. Our personal income will skyrocket to new heights.... Dreams that were previously considered merely Utopian fantasies in a Capitalist Dictatorship that stripped away all income and wealth will be realizable goals in a People-First civilization that more fairly distributes income and wealth allowing it to gush across the economy. Freeing up the income stream that is parasitically drained from the economy by elite cannibals who wastefully gamble it away within the financial industry on stock markets like Wall Street will mean we will have many trillions of dollars in real income to use for whatever purpose we desire. Lending at usury interest rates to the general population money generated from the surplus that was stolen from the productive labor of workers is the kind of flimflam slight-of-hand that will stop in an equitable People-First civilization. Elite mobsters stealing from us so they can bulk up on illusory investments yielding phantom assets that they and their financial hoodlums turn around and lend back to us at interest rates Tony Soprano would be proud of is the kind of indecent larceny that will be outlawed in our new civilization. We will at last be able to tell these thieves to stuff it and find a real vocation instead of being enslavers of their fellow citizen's. Laborers will have total control over the disposition of all business profits within the new worker organizations that will replace the corruption infused corporate entity. This surplus will be ours to determine how we want to apportion it among salaries, business reinvestment, and taxes going to government for public works projects and other essential services like healthcare, education, social security, transportation infrastructure, and defense. Below is a short primer to help you to better understand what a surplus is and how it relates to a new People-First economy. What we really need are some completely novel base economic formulas to explain how a democratic economic system functions within an egalitarian society. Let me first expand upon that elusive term called capital. Now with these variables defined let us build up how my envisioned amalgamation of a socialist and capitalist economic system embedded within our new society would operate at the most basic level. Now we may delve deeper into this general formula. A year over year infinity of capital buildup - at least from the standpoint of how far back is logically relevant from an historical perspective. Alright, hold tight because here is the clincher. What the Capitalists through their taker society resting firmly upon their exploitative capitalist economy have done is nothing short of amazing. This is pure nonsense. We the workers have transformed products and services of little inherent value into creations that are valuable to many perspective customers on an open and fair market. Every single aspect of a citizen's life will be touched by the democratic process. Our aspirations are the cleansing white winter making the ground ready for the brilliant colored spring. The land you walk on, the parks you play in, the businesses you work in, the sky that invites your dreams, the governments, and the society of this planet, everything in its entirety is yours to do with what you want. Genuine democracy is not some diluted contrivance that is parsed out at will by a tiny fraction of the population just to serve their exclusive interests. Get off of your duffs and turn this damn chain-gang of a planetary mess around. Our destiny, dreams, and actions are expanding and transforming this rich-club of vultures from a plunder camp into a genuine civilization where happiness is no stranger and dancing is something we will do to let off some joy."}, {"URL": "http://rakindkaur.blogspot.com/2016/11/as-we-mourn-for-democracy.html?spref=tw", "Timestamp": "20180918235027", "Sentences": "Yesterday morning everybody was crying of shock and horror; and by night we assembled one of the most beautiful protest that brought me to tears.

As demonstrators pushed through a blocked bridge on a state highway, authorities attempted to quell the crowd with rubber bullets, tear gas, and the use of water cannons in subfreezing temperatures. Of the estimated 400 protesters there that night, organizers say at least seventeen were taken to the hospital. Many had hypothermia. One protester is at apparent risk of losing an arm after she was hit by concussion grenade. Protesters in mass amounts, estimated to be around 400, are on the bridge and attempting to breach the bridge to go north on highway 1806. Protesters have started a dozen fires near the bridge.

The Indian Massacre of 1622, the Indian Removal Act of 1830, the Carlisle School in the late 1800s, Wounded Knee in 1890, the DAPL protests in 2016. The liberal white guilt surrounding the colonization of the Americas has always been particularly phony, especially considering the continued mistreatment and marginalization of Native American communities in the United States. Do not let fear of enacting that phoniness lead you into guilt and despair, however, because as liberal white people have (most disappointingly) shown time and time again, those are useless feelings that ultimately makes one even more complacent.

That report, read by Anne-Marie Green, aired on the CBS Morning News at 4 a.m. on September 5. Protesters confronted workers Saturday at a construction site. Police say four private security guards and two guard dogs were hurt. Still, FAIR noted gaps in coverage across establishment sources. The media went on to ignore other instances of journalists being abused by law enforcement. One independent journalist who contributes to mainstream outlet Politico was shot with a rubber bullet while reporting on peaceful protests in November. Indeed, over the course of several months, the establishment media avoided providing extensive coverage of the DAPL protests, even as police tactics grew increasingly aggressive. Where the mainstream media failed, the independent media relentlessly covered the protests, promoting livestreams of the events that showed journalists and protesters being brutally arrested. Independent outlets made videos, posted articles, and ensured literally millions of people learned about what was occurring at Standing Rock, all while their journalists were under attack on the ground. During this period, the mainstream media was busy propping up Hillary Clinton, spreading Cold War-era propaganda, and most recently, attempting to smear independent media in the fallout from the election. The weekend before Thanksgiving, the corporate media took an unprecedented interest in the protests at Standing Rock after police fired water cannons at protesters in freezing temperatures. After livestream footage showed hours of the onslaught, headlines from establishment print media outlets began to emerge. But as FAIR noted, many failed to convey the severity of the situation. In fact, FAIR contends multiple outlets intentionally downplayed it. Though FAIR notes several media outlets did acknowledge the severity of police behavior in their headlines, some of the biggest names in news failed to fully report on the events of that evening, throughout which hundreds of protesters were injured while one cop was hit in the head with a rock. They were reaching huge audiences. The latter had a reporter on the ground corresponding live, and CNN, too, had a reporter on the ground. And this is precisely the problem. There are many lessons to be learned from Standing Rock. Most notably, it is the power of protest, overwhelmingly peaceful action, and the ability of people of all walks of life to come together and collectively and effectively challenge the establishment. Without the help of government or the lapdog media, protesters were able to raise thousands of dollars and enjoyed abundant donations of food, cold weather gear, and camping supplies. The veterans, alone, were able to raise over a million dollars (though mainstream media coverage admittedly must have helped boost that figure). The mainstream media is becoming increasingly irrelevant because of the exact behavior they displayed at Standing Rock. Please help continue this trend by supporting the news outlets and journalists who forced them to cover the story in the first place. Unicorn Riot had multiple journalists on the ground and provided some of the best live stream footage of the events, even as some of them were arrested in the process. Derrick Broze was reporting and livestreaming for Anti-Media and others in North Dakota. He made three trips to Standing Rock to cover the events and in addition to being tasered by police four times after identifying himself as media (see video above),he was also pepper sprayed. This was achieved through social media and the independent media. We can end the oilgarchy, statism, and environmental destruction once we change our thinking and ultimately our habits.

The story, like many others at the time, was being suffocating by an obstreperous presidential campaign that had just entered the home stretch. At first, I too had thought this was a Keystone XL one-off, soon to be swept away by the unforgiving cycle of news. But, after barreling half way across the country and trudging through over the frozen Dakota plains, I came to the realization that this story was riddled with oligarchic, environmental and indigenous oppression that was far more riveting than any pipeline story I had ever seen before. In September, I was honored to interview LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, who told me the story of her people and provided me with true insight on the issue. Just a couple of weeks prior, police had unleashed dogs on the water protectors. Allard had gotten involved solely for personal reasons. She had lost her son, and he was buried on ground adjacent to the pipeline site. Inspired by Allard's story and commitment, I began to research Standing Rock. The government of North Dakota is dependent on the oil industry, and I realized the decision to cease the pipeline was much more difficult than it should ever be. Still, the abuse at the protest sight seemed impossible to ignore. As a young journalist fresh out of college, I covered the Democracy Spring movement, protesting Citizens United in Washington D.C., where 1400 people were arrested. I covered protests outside the Democratic National Convention, including a three-mile march down Broad Street to FDR Park. In fact, these are events I very much enjoy reporting on. I believe that protesting is a cornerstone of democracy. This event was very different. This was not a protest. People from all over the country joining together to not only defend the land that belongs to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, according to the treaties of Fort Laramie in 1851 and 1868, but also to defend the purity of the Missouri river that 18 million Americans use as a source of drinking water. I was operating on a very tight budget. In terms of my tech equipment, I made use of what I had, bringing my mother's ten-year-old canon 3od camera, a GoPro Hero 3, my notebook, my laptop and a few portable phone chargers. I flew out of Newark Airport on a clear Friday morning. It set the scene for Standing Rock perfectly: The civil dissent took place while a corporatized media busied itself pursuing ratings and seeking profit, ginning up endless stories of Donald Trump, and then laying blame for the outcome of the presidential election on anybody and anything the pundits could conjure. I landed in Bismark and rented a car for the 55 minute trip to my hotel in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. I had never seen such dark roads in my life. About 12 miles from my destination, there was a roadblock. The main highway from Bismarck to Cannon Ball was closed, expressly to discourage people from traveling from to the protest. So I turned down the narrow road my navigation system diverted me to, but I came to a couple of dead ends. The small road was a sheet of ice, untouched by plow. While making a K-turn to head back towards the main highway, my car slid into a snowbank. I maneuvered lamely for half an hour but only made the situation worse. I was running out of ideas. To my surprise, an SUV pulled down the road. I tapped my brakes rapidly to draw attention to myself. The driver who stopped to offer his full assistance became someone I am still very thankful to have met. The man who stepped out of the car was Tony Hill, a Navy veteran who served eight years as an aviations electrician. We were both headed to the same place, and for similar reasons. He was properly dressed for the North Dakota weather, friendly and surprisingly talkative for someone I had just met. He had snacks, supplies and cases of water in his trunk. He looked prepared; he looked like a veteran. I was pleased to have his companionship and encouraged by his conversation. By the time we got the rental back on the road, we were friends. We agreed to travel together to the protest the next morning. Oceti Sakowin, the protest camp of the Standing Rock Sioux, was one of the most beautiful places I had ever seen. It was much larger than I could have imagined. While in line I met a number of journalists, photographers, filmmakers and freelancers, mainly from smaller media outlets. I wanted to gather information from them and to understand why they decided to come out here and what they planned on documenting. I spent the rest of the day chatting with locals, veterans and travelers who came from all over the country to stand in solidarity. I walked up a hill just outside of the camp to get some shots of the closed and barricaded highway. The police, who looked like an army, loomed in the distance in armored vehicles and trucks. I was able to take some useful photographs and then made my way down the hill to Blackwater Bridge, walking to the furthest point we were allowed. He stared into the distance at the occupying force, as if he was sending some sort of message to them. There was something very eerie about it, something anachronistic to witness in the year 2016. The atmosphere of Oceti Sakowin was one of peace and love. The camp was inhabited by people from all over the country who might otherwise never have crossed paths but who stood in solidarity for one common goal. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed. On Monday morning, I attended an informal press conference for veterans that included speakers like Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard and Phyllis Young, tribal elder and prominent leader of the movement. They thanked the veterans for their support, and discussed the importance of unity. I took some time to talk to a few veterans. Their courage and dedication to continued service of their nation's best interests was inspiring. I realized at that moment how much their presence meant to the Natives, to activists and to the movement in its entirety. Seeing veterans travel far and wide to protect and stand in solidarity with the Native Americans and their supporters was awe inspiring. I saw Dr. Cornel West greeting protectors, natives and veterans with hugs and kind words. There was a large crowd and a strong spirit of confidence in the air. Protectors joined hands and encircled the entire camp. Minutes later, a Native came to announce that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had denied the final pipeline permit and construction would be halted. As word spread, so did joy and a sense of accomplishment. On Monday morning, I attended a ceremony in the casino I was staying at. It was a meeting between some of the military veterans and tribal members of the Standing Rock Sioux. Many of the elders, including Phyllis Young, Chief Leonard Crow Dog and others spoke before the crowd. They reminded everyone that there was still a fight ahead and that they must remain organized and peaceful, even if ETP defied orders and continued to drill. Afterwards, Wes Clark, Jr., one of the primary leaders of the veterans' movement, got in formation by rank, with his men and women behind him. He spoke softly, humbly asked for forgiveness for the long brutal history our country has with the Natives, and offered his service. The ceremony ended with the two groups hugging one another, while some veterans shared their stories and explained why they have come to contribute to this cause. My time in North Dakota was one of the greatest experiences of my life. It is about a level of environmental oppression that deserved national coverage. The story was overlooked as merely the latest chronicle in the tale of the haves and the have-nots. The Standing Rock Sioux encampment was a communitarian living structure: food, shelter and healthcare were shared. Much of what we take for granted is the same thing these people have historically been denied. Charlie May Charlie May is a news writer at Salon.

They exemplify what it means to be an authentically empowered woman in the matrilineal way of being. A woman's strength is motivated by a desire to serve the greater good. More than a phrase, it is a guiding principle for living that extends to all beings. This includes the land and waters, both of which are feminine in nature. It is an entity that you have a relationship with and you respect, like your grandmother, mother, and aunts. We have to be good stewards. We have to take care of the land. We have to feed her and offer her prayers. In return, we are blessed with good health. Our enemies are also our relatives. One afternoon, I witnessed an exchange between an elder and a young cook who had cursed the pipeline executives. You dishonored Mother Earth and the bounty that came from her. You lowered the vibration of the opposition. I asked one of the organizers how, after nearly 525 years of oppression, the 300 tribal nations represented at the camp could believe that peace will prevail. At Standing Rock, service can be literal, as is the case for the women who prepare and serve food to thousands at the camp each day. Washing dishes, caring for the children, or readying the warriors for their marches may be seen through Westernized eyes as subservient. Here, these acts are performed with honor. We believe our ultimate weapon is prayer. This, I was told, does not mean that women should emulate men. In interview after interview, the women of Standing Rock said that we are at the end of the patriarchal era of competition, aggression, and force. As Pearl explained, we are now in a new era called the Fifth World by the indigenous peoples of North America. That energy resonates with the highest frequency, which is love. Compassion. One morning, a 14-year-old girl asked those sitting before the sacred fire to reflect upon the trauma that may have occurred in the lives of the pipeline security guards who attacked members of the camp with dogs and pepper spray. They need kindness. The women of Standing Rock remind us that strength can be subtle or forceful, and that both are necessary. 3. A woman's strength is sustained by a sense of responsibility. Their vow to protect Mother Earth and all her inhabitants is their responsibility to the ancestors, and to the seven generations to come.

The person said they simply find Native American T-shirts that have already been uploaded to SunFrog and collect them on one page, earning a commission each time they sell. SunFrog is one of several websites that enable anyone to to upload a design and then offer print-on-demand ordering for a range of clothing. He pointed to a form on its website that anyone can use to make a claim. He also said anyone who falsely claims to sell clothing in support of a cause will have their account closed and SunFrog will donate their earnings to charity. Yodzevicis said SunFrog has seen an increase in infringing designs and false charity claims related to Standing Rock. One of the bigger pages identified by BuzzFeed News is called Indigenous People of America and has over 750,000 fans. It shares a steady stream of news related to events in Standing Rock, but under many of its posts it also promotes the sale of a knockoff of a shirt created by actor Shailene Woodley to raise funds for Standing Rock. The only official seller of the Woodley shirt is Omaze, yet the design can be found for sale on many other online clothing sites as well as on Amazon. SunFrog removed a version of the shirt for sale on its site after being alerted to it by BuzzFeed News, though other copies of the design remain for sale on the site. Another big Facebook page hawking inauthentic Native American goods is Native American Indians, which has over 360,000 fans and promotes merchandise from a store called NativeThing.com. Once they receive their order people realize it was made in China, gives off a noxious odor, and that the company subsequently refuses to accept returns. Many other pages pursue a similar strategy of building up an audience with Native content and then trying to sell them shirts and other items that are often rip-offs of Native designs. One newer page is called I Stand with Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and shares a steady diet of news about the protest mixed with constant pleas for people to show their support by buying shirts for the cause. The page did not respond to a question about whether it donates any money to the tribe. Along with stealing the work of Native artists, and the likenesses of models and celebrities, some scammers even used a photo of the first Native American federal judge to create fake profiles to help spread their content. Her photo has been used on at least three fake Facebook profiles, one of which lists its two only friends as two young men in Kosovo. One of the largest networks of Native American Facebook pages initially identified by BuzzFeed News belonged to two young men in Kosovo. At the time of the interview, their pages had close to 2 million fans. However, after speaking to BuzzFeed News all of their pages were taken offline. where Dardan and a partner publish clickbait articles about a wide variety of topics, though rarely about Native Americans. Dardan did not respond to a subsequent Facebook message from BuzzFeed News asking why they had removed their Native American Facebook pages. BuzzDuzz is still publishing as of this writing. Some of the Native American designers who spoke to BuzzFeed News said the non-Natives running the pages and selling stolen designs are making more money than they are. Aaron Silva, a Native American and the co-founder of The NTVS clothing brand in Minnesota, said the dubious Native American sellers often have one or several large Facebook pages to use to promote the merchandise. Silva also said these pages spend money to create sponsored Facebook posts that promote the item for sale to large numbers of people. One of its current sponsored posts shows photos of Bernie Sanders and celebrities with the Shailene Woodley shirt. This sponsored post for a stolen design has received over 125,000 reactions, 15,000 comments, and close to 18,000 shares as of this writing. It had over 33,000 reactions, nearly 4,000 comments, and over 8,000 shares. These sponsored posts also help grow the number of fans for that page: When BuzzFeed News first found the Native American Cultures page roughly two weeks ago, it had just over 57,000 fans. It now has over 72,000. It has close to 12,000 reactions, just over 500 comments, and 2,100 shares as of this writing. The comment thread was soon filled with people sharing other examples of suspect pages, and of designers talking about how they too had their work stolen. Silva and others have also tried to contact T-shirt sites such as SunFrog and TeeChip to get their designs removed. They said the takedown forms and procedures take up a lot of their time. Yodzevicis from SunFrog said their reporting form has only a few fields to complete and submissions are checked roughly every hour. He also said the company is working to implement a procedure whereby any money earned from a stolen design will be sent to the original artist. Silva said Facebook is easier to deal with, but that it only removes the offending post rather than an entire page. Yazzie has also tried directly contacting the Facebook pages that promote his stolen designs for sale. But at most he says they will delete the post with his design and just upload it again later. For his part, Silva is amazed at how so many people in different parts of the world have discovered that dubious Native American Facebook pages, websites, and merchandise can be a moneymaker.

After months of watching events unfold in Cannon Ball, my husband and I decided that we could no longer sit idly while the biggest fight for environmental & human rights of our lifetime was being fought. I proposed the idea of driving to Standing Rock to help with the camp and two days later, we made the 12 hours drive with our baby and our dog. The standoff at Standing Rock is an age old story of colonialism. But after 500 years of systemic oppression, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe decided enough was enough and took on the fight to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline. They also argue that the pipeline goes through miles of land which rightfully belongs to the tribe. Officials from Energy Transfer Partners (the company behind the pipeline) claim that the pipeline is safe and does not encroach on native lands. The Army Corps of Engineers approved the pipeline despite objections by three government agencies including the EPA. The full document can be found here. The DAPL was originally routed to cross the Missouri River north of Bismark. This route was rejected because the citizens of Bismark, a predominantly white town, expressed concern for its potential threat to their water supply. Oh the irony. You can read more about the original route here. Then On the drive to Standing Rock, I was unsure what to expect. Reports of clashes between the water protectors and militarized police monopolized my social media feeds. Temperatures were beginning to drop and it happened to be our very first camping occasion as a family. For some reason, these banners quelled my worries. When we found a spot to set up camp, we were greeted by warm campfire lit smiles of our would be neighbors. One lady told me that the tent next to ours was vacant, left by a friend of hers in case someone was in need of shelter. By the time Mitz finished setting up our tent, the sun had set so we made our way around the camp to observe our surroundings. Drums, chants and singing filled the air. People were gathered arround campfires listening to stories or up on their feet dancing like noone was watching. Our exploration was short due to exhaustion from the drive. We decided to call it a night early in preparation for the next day. That night was cold albeit bearable. What stood out was the constant sound of a helicopter flying over head. This went on all night. I learned the next day that this was a nightly experience, they were being monitored by law enforcment despite the area being a no fly zone. We started the next day with a quick breakfast followed by a drum march to the river. There, elders led a prayer and people waited patiently in line to bless the water. An action in Bismark was scheduled that morning. We missed the caravan by a few minutes so we decided to stay behind and help with winterizing the camp. While walking around, I was so impressed by how self sufficient the camp had become. Day in and out, volunteers worked the kitchen to provide lunch and dinner for everyone in need. At another tent, blankets, jackets, and other supplies were sorted free for anyone lacking. By the Sacred Fire, a ceremonial fire at the center of the camp that people kept burning day and night, people of different races and ages converged to listen to elders speak, pray, and partake in ceremonies. The People By the Sacred Fire, we met a fellow Filipina from San Francisco. Her time there, like ours, was brief as she had to be back for parent teacher conferences come Monday. When I asked her why it was so important that she personally came, she said it was because there was no way she could justify not helping to her children. He had been there for weeks already having left his job and sold his home in Georgia to be there with the Water Protectors. There is a woman named Diane Hart who made the 2000 mile drive from California to North Dakota. She said her heart was drawn there and she had hoped that her presence makes a difference. At the end of the buffet line, she waits to greet every person served and gives them the type of embrace only a grandmother full of love can offer. Every day, they organize actions-mass ceremonies, prayers, and marches to the front line where police await. Direct action orientations are held daily. They emphasize that all actions must be peaceful and encourage the water protectors to pray for the opposition. Now Over the past few weeks, the camp has been in rush mode to prepare for the North Dakota rush winter. With temperatures below freezing, the water protectors were sprayed via a water canon on top of an armored vehicle. Tear gas, rubber bullets, and concussion grenades were reportedly used. Many were treated for hypothermia and one young girl now faces losing her arm after she claimed law enforcement threw a concussion grenade right at her. Days later, on November 25th, the Army Corps of Engineers served the camp with a notice to vacate by December 5th or risk facing arrests citing public safety concerns. Yesterday, the International Indigenous Youth Council along with the tribal elders held a press conference imploring President Obama to honor the promise he made to protect the tribe a few years prior. Send supplies for the water protectors. You can find a list of their needs here. Donate directly to the camp here. Funds will be used for sanitary, supplies, and emergency purposes. Donate to the protesters legal defense here. A list can be found here. More than ever, they need people with special skills (legal, medical, carpentry, etc), bodies to stand in solidarity, and voices and prayers. Keep the conversation going.

Nearly 2 million children in Syria are out of school, with roughly one-third of all schools unusable due to destruction, damage, or use for shelter or military purposes, according to Unicef. An additional half a million Syrian children are out of school in neighbouring countries, said Touma. Syrian children are nonetheless united in their thirst for education, according to Touma, who pointed to the hundreds who study Arabic, maths and English in an underground cave in Idlib province. School infrastructure has been devastated, teacher-flight is widespread, and students are at risk of being targeted on their way to school. I dream of a Syria without a war so we can go home.

It was a powerful moment to stand shoulder to shoulder with friends, associates at the Cherokee Nation and tribal citizens from around the country to lend our voice and support for the Standing Rock people in their just fight to reroute a proposed oil pipeline that could harm historic and sacred sites, and potentially contaminate the water supply for 18 million people. It is simply amazing what tribal people can accomplish when we come together in times of need. We delivered vital supplies, including firewood and winter clothing that our Cherokee Nation Youth Council collected. It marked the third official trip from our government, not to mention the hundreds of individual Cherokees who have traveled to support the cause. We have contributed funds for the legal battle and much needed firewood and supplies for the upcoming winter months, which on the North Dakota prairie can be brutal. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, like Cherokee Nation, has always been a good steward of the land. However, Native people can and should be part of the solution for a sustainable future and for the development of clean, safe energy. We must have a seat at the table before decisions are made impacting the safety, health and natural resources of our communities because economies can no longer be built on the backs of Native people. At the Sacred Stone Camp, water protectors are prepared for a long winter and ready to peacefully defend the water that sustains so many communities down the river.

The Bismarck Police Department reported that officers pulled Thompson's vehicle over around 6 p.m. after multiple witnesses reported he was hitting a 21-year-old woman in the car. Police searched the vehicle and found a handgun tucked between the driver's seat and the center console, as well as a rifle in the backseat. He told the judge that he has been having issues with his girlfriend since his sister died in a car accident two weeks ago. After listening to Thompson's story, Romanick also ordered him to seek addiction treatment evaluation and make contact with Veteran's Affairs for potential counseling. Thompson is the security worker who got into a conflict with protesters as he drove down N.D. Highway 1806 towards the Dakota Access Pipeline protest camps on Oct. 27 to take photos of burning equipment. Two protesters allegedly rammed their cars into Thompson's to get him off the road, where the protesters said he was endangering people. There was also a confrontation in the water, during which Thompson held an AR-15 rifle and some protesters allegedly threatened him with knives. Police determined Thompson was the victim in the protest-related case. The men maintain their innocence.

The proposed pipeline would have carried crude oil underneath Lake Oahe, a dammed-up part of Missouri River and the main water source for the reservation. The Sioux tribe has repeatedly expressed concerns that the pipeline could lead to contamination of their water supply and threaten its water and treaty rights. After months of the stand-off involving protesters (who call themselves Water Protectors) and police, the Army Corps announced on Sunday that it would not grant permission for Dakota Access LLC (DPL) to drill under the river. It was the culmination of an intense struggle that involved shocking levels of police brutality.

I'm here to protect the resources that we have rights to. Melaine Stoneman, from the Sicangu Lakota (Burnt Thigh Nation) tribe in Pine Ridge Reservation, South Dakota I have been here since day one.

I think that all of us had this dreams of doing what we can and we've been called to it in our lifetime, so the river and the land are helping us fulfill those dreams. It's so marvelous to watch him, because I think that's my DNA, my blood, and that's going to live on for generations.

They are the original freedom fighters and they've always been freedom fighters, so right now we're in training. We're also fighting alongside them, so I'm here in service of my people. Courtney and Amber McCornack, from Albert Lea, Minnesota Courtney McCornack: We've been back and forth for months. I brought my daughter here and we have been building teepees with other women and donating them to the people that need them. I want her to stay connected to her intuitive side, which is what the Native American communities have been doing since the beginning. I came because I've been following this issue for many months, and become more and more involved watching videos on social media. I just felt that I had to be here, and so I'm representing lots of people from all over the world. So here I am, ready to help. Anonymous aunt and her niece, with tribal affiliations from the Desert Southwest, Apache, and Mexican tribes We are here because Native people have been fighting for sovereignty on this land for over 500 years. This is a monumental event; unprecedented. We want to show corporate America that many people are not supportive of mineral extractions and we're all about clean water and being healthy people. The only way to maintain that is standing up for what's right. We have the kind of technologies to be able to have cleaner energy sources but that power is being held by the leaders and the privileged, so the rest of us get screwed in the end.

So I'm just going to keep praying and appealing to that. Tosha Luger from the Hunkpapa tribe of the Seven Council Fires of the Lakota Sioux in Standing Rock I was born and raised in these lands. I lost my husband and my father a year ago, very close to each other, and I was broken. I live on a ranch just south of here and I would go down to the river every day. Being here is a very humbling experience and we must remain focused. This river goes all the way out to the Missouri River and all the way down to the ocean. That's what we are protecting. I was crushed when that girl's arm got blown off... I myself ended up with a concussion, got tear-gassed and maced and stood in the freezing cold whilst they were spraying us with water cannons. They are telling us to go home, but they don't understand that we are already home. In order to change things, we must remain in prayer and peace. I feel so honored for all these people who have heard our prayers and have joined us in this, and I hope they will bring our healing and teachings back to where they are from and start changing the world, empower Mother Earth, and be more compassionate, kind, and empathetic.

Wood Jr., received widespread media attention. Their event page states they have over 2,100 veterans signed up and are exploring options for a second trip. The group has a strict no weapons policy but is stocking up on body armor and protective gear like gas masks to withstand potential attacks from the heavily militarized police, who have arrested at least 400 of protesters so far. According to on-site medics, hundreds of protesters have also been injured. Last week, a 21-year-old woman was reportedly hit with a concussion grenade, leading to a severe injury that may require her arm to be amputated. With 2,100 veterans signed up to make a stand, it appears police will be forced to reconcile their aggressive behavior with the nonviolent show of veterans, who intend to march toward police on site. The group has gained substantial financial backing since word of their mission spread. In a short period of two days, the picture changed dramatically. The funds will also go toward bailing out members of the group who are arrested during their demonstration. Anti-Media spoke to one Navy veteran, Jake Bagwell, who heard about the event last week through social media and is now scheduled to head to Standing Rock, pending his request for time off from work.

When the Standing Rock-based priest returned to North Dakota, he drafted a callout to clergy around the country. The gathering drew more than 500 clergy members of different faiths to the Oceti Sakowin Camp. The group walked to the barricade on the Backwater Bridge before turning back, creating a moment many said evoked the march in Selma. No one was arrested, though a few, whose bravado Floberg critiqued, traveled to Bismarck and protested at the Capitol, where they were detained. Though support and endorsements have flooded in from religious institutions around the world, few Christian leaders on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and in North Dakota took an active role. In fact, Floberg was nearly unique in his activism. Floberg has been an Episcopal priest on the reservation for the past 25 years with churches in Cannon Ball, Fort Yates and Selfridge. He sees the pipeline fight as the reason for his years there. Watching the anger demonstrated some nights on the bridge, he saw those same feelings devolve into depression among the youth in his ministry. In the relations with the government, he saw hundreds of years of unfulfilled promises and leaders who did not listen. The camps were filled with prayer, much of it traditional, and many described the monthslong movement as an extended ceremony. A sacred fire was central to the main Oceti Sakowin camp, and prayers in Lakota were frequently performed. Seeing the prayer at camp, Floberg decided not to hold services there, worried it may cause breakage and division amid the unity he saw. With the endorsement of the national Episcopal Church, Floberg provided supplies to campers, hosted people in his church and has undertaken efforts to smooth relations between people on and off the reservation. Recently, he started handing out gift cards to his Native American congregants for them to eat with non-native friends in Bismarck-Mandan. Others in the Standing Rock Christian leadership took on a more spiritual, less active role. The Rev. George Maufort, of St. Peter's Catholic Church, saw his role in prayer and support for his congregants. He traveled to the camps occasionally and listened as congregants grieved over the fear of water contamination. Maufort, who is knowledgeable of the Native American traditional prayers and ceremonies practiced at the camp, said he believed all the prayer was valid. When protests grew violent, he could not support them. Another local Christian leader chose to avoid involvement in the protest, though his church is located in Cannon Ball. He was concerned that such entanglement might affect his ability to help locally. Now, he's troubled to see the deepened divisions between natives and non-natives in North Dakota. The Rev. Boots Marsh and his wife, Jackie, have a youth ministry for young children. He has interacted with the protesters and, most recently, accepted a few donations as they helped clean the camp.

The Yazidi Kurds, who call the genocides perpetrated on them 'Ferman', the Kurdish term for decree, fell this time into the grip of almost total annihilation, captivity and enslavement by the ferocious ISIS gangs. But what was more suffocating for the Yazidis than the stranglehold of ISIS, was the betrayal that clad itself in a black garment. THE WELL-PREPARED GENOCIDE When the ISIS gangs stood at the doors of Shengal, thousands of Peshmerga and asayish members of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) chaired by Masoud Barzani, who until that very moment controlled the Shengal town, made a quick getaway without shooting even one single bullet. As a result of the flight of the KDP Peshmerga, thousands of Yazidis were slaughtered by the ISIS gangs, thousands more were abducted, predominantly women and children, and sold at markets into slavery. Interestingly, shortly before the genocide took place, the KDP forces seized all the arms and weapons the Yazidis had at that time and took into custody three of the twelve guerrillas of the People's Defense Forces (HPG) and the Free Women's Troops (YJA-Star), who came to the rescue of the fleeing Yazidi people. All this made it indeed very clear, how well prepared and organized this extensive genocide actually was. THE UN REPORT ON THE GENOCIDE According to the investigations of the High Commissioner of Human Rights of the United Nations, which were made public in October 2014, the results of the attacks launched on the 3rd August 2014 were as follows: - around 5000 Yazidi men were massacred - around 100 Yazidi men were beheaded - 7000 Yazidi girls and women were abducted and sold at slave markets - A number of Yazidi girls and women were raped - Some Yazidi women were forced to marry ISIS commanders The later revealed actual numbers of the victims and the countless Yazidis who starved to death and died of thirst, clearly showed that the estimated number of unknown cases was much higher than what was written in the report of the United Nations. Most of those mass murders were perpetrated by the Ottoman empire. The first genocide was ordered in the year 1246 by the lord of Zengi of Mosul, Bedreddin Lulu, the last one by the Neo Ottoman AKP and its ally KDP and perpetrated by the ISIS gangs. In each and every genocide, the name of Islam was used. THE MASSACRE OF 2007 One of the more recent mass killings against the Yazidi Kurds took place in 2007. On the 14th August 2007 attacks were carried out with four bomb laden trucks in the villages Siba Shex Xidir and Til Izer of Shengal. As a result 300 people were killed. No investigations were launched in this case whatsoever. It was reported that this massacre was perpetrated by a group of gangs called Ensar El Sune affiliated with Al-Qaeda, which tried at that time to get some foothold in Southern Kurdistan. However many sources said that the gang Turkmen Front of Iraq (ITC) was involved in the attack, which was forged by the Turkish secret service in Southern Kurdistan. In 1975 under the Iraqi Ba'ath regime the Yazidis were forcibly resettled. In each and every genocide they faced, the Yazidi people saved themselves into the protective arms of Mount Shengal. When in 2003 the US intervened in Iraq and toppled the regime of Saddam Hussein, a new constitution was prepared for Iraq. A referendum was planned for 2007 to be held in Shengal as well, but until today that referendum was never realised. However unlike the cities of Kirkuk, Jalawla, Khanaqin and Tuz Khurmatu, the KDP established its monocracy in Shengal. The KDP even used the faith of the Yazidis for its own advantages and supported this sheikh system, keeping tabs on the entire Yazidi people. They told them, go eat and drink and take your money, but do not think. They did not appreciate it when people were talking about things like honour, freedom and values. But one must not let out the continuous resistance of the women against this. Yet those struggles were mostly constricted to some private persons. TOWARDS THE AUGUST 3 GENOCIDE On the 10th of June 2014 when ISIS invaded Mosul, Shengal ran into danger more than any other district of Mosul. On the growing imminent threats that were hovering over Shengal, the leadership of the PKK got in contact with the KDP and called attention to the grave situation. The PKK made clear, that it could send some of its forces to Shengal, but the KDP did not answer this call of the PKK. A FORCE OF 11000 WELL EQUIPPED MEN WERE ON SITE After invading Mosul, the ISIS gangs charged Tal Afar, a district of the Turkmen community in immediate vicinity of Shengal. A great deal of the Shia Turkmen people here fled to Shengal. The gangs were now very close to attack Shengal next. According to official statistics that were revealed afterwards, prior to the barbaric attacks of the ISIS gangs on Shengal, the number of the Peshmerga and asayish members of Southern Kurdistan and the Iraqi Federal Police, traffic police and armed units that were affiliated with some other political parties comprised altogether 11000 personnel positioned in Shengal and the surrounding villages. Because we were surrounded by a massive army of Peshmergas and even Iraqi soldiers. And we trusted them. They used to tell us: 'We will protect you'. But unfortunately, they fled when the attacks started. When ISIS swept over ravaging, all the arms of the Yazidi youth were taken away from them here. They assured us with words like: 'We will protect you, don't worry, you don't need to take up arms'. And they seized there all the weapons. However during the genocide they did not even shoot a bullet, they did not give one martyr and had not even one of their fingers bleed."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/249549706t?referring_akid=.1932296.2lb1_Z", "Timestamp": "20180918225548", "Sentences": "Credo Action Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument.

Flags flying at the Capitol, the U.S. Marine Band, gray eminences in black coats, and He Who Is Smarter than Those With Intelligence delivers 16 minutes of hooey and horse hockey about corrupt politicians betraying the people, and American carnage, and patriotism healing our divisions, though the division is mainly about Himself and love of country does not necessarily make people stupid.

The next day he motored out to the CIA and stood before the memorial wall honoring the heroes who gave their lives in anonymity and he bitched about his newspaper coverage. The next day he boasted that his inaugural's TV ratings were higher than those in 2013. The day after that, he told the congressional leadership that he lost the popular vote because millions of illegal votes were cast, which everyone in the room knew was a bald-faced lie, except perhaps Himself. The man is clueless, tightly locked inside his own small bubble. A sizable minority of Americans, longing for greatness or wanting to smack down an ambitious woman and to show those people in the hellhole coastal cities what the real America is all about, has elected him. To him, this minority is a mass movement such as the world has never seen. God have mercy. Jobs are lost to automation, innovation, obsolescence, the moving finger of fate. The carriage industry was devastated by the automobile, and the men who made surreys and broughams and hansoms had to learn something new; the Pullman porter union was hit hard by the advent of air travel and the porters sent their sons to college; the newspaper business was hit hard by Craigslist.

Weeks earlier and under emergency orders issued by former Governor Jack Dalrymple, the North Dakota National Guard manned the first barricade, more of a checkpoint for passing cars. Tensions brewed at the frontline that day. Police or security personnel taunted activists through a megaphone, teasing them about being cowards behind masks. At their line sat military Humvees, a tan armored vehicle equipped with a sound cannon. Activists brandished plywood shields, and refused to budge. Most activists shouted peaceful messages; one man hurled insults at the police. After police issued a final warning, law enforcement from five states decked out in sheriff deputy uniforms, riot gear, and armed with mace, pepper spray, rubber bullets, zip ties and clubs, some with live ammunition, formed a Roman-style phalanx and marched down the highway toward Backwater Bridge. Activists smudged each other with burning sweetgrass and sage. One woman sat amidst the crowd praying, crying so hard her shoulders shook. Two women hugged each other tightly as the marching police neared. The day was saved by one man with snowy-white hair, smoking a pipe, and wearing a jogging suit, Miles Allard, an elder from Standing Rock.

TigerSwan operatives called security workers from Silverton International unprofessional and unarmed. Now, the mercenary-for-hire company and its founder, James Patrick Reese, face a civil action lawsuit filed by the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board on June 12, 2017. A security company providing illegal security services in North Dakota is a Class B misdemeanor, Rogneby said. The North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board is a governor-appointed committee that licenses and regulates private security industries, according to its website. EH Investigations civil complaint According to the civil complaint filed by the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board, Jeremie Meisel is listed as the responsible license holder for EH Investigations and Security, LLC, a licensed security agency in North Dakota. In August, 2016, Meisel and EH Investigations were contacted by Leighton Security Services, Inc. to assist with security along the Dakota Access Pipeline. In the fall of 2016, Meisel relinquished his responsibility to Leighton in violation of North Dakota law, according to the civil complaint. The civil complaint further mentioned some of EH Investigations employees: Richard Anderson, Jason Wentz, Chris Anderson, Eizabeth Marlow, Merry Jenson, and Kimberly Stuart. None were registered in North Dakota to provide security services at the times of their hiring. The North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board further requested a hearing to revoke the license and registration of Meisel and EH Investigations, or take lawful disciplinary action against them. Calls were made and messages were left to EH Investigations personnel for comment, but no replies were made at press time. TigerSwan civil action The civil action lawsuit against TigerSwan revealed the mercenary-for-hire company had a methodical and blatant disregard for North Dakota laws. Energy Transfer Partners hired TigerSwan in September 2016, the civil action lawsuit reported. On or before September 23, 2016, the North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board notified TigerSwan with a letter that it was illegally providing security services in North Dakota. On October 5, 2016, North Dakota Private Investigation and Security Board sent TigerSwan the guidelines for licensure in the state, and on November 16, 2016, TigerSwan submitted its application on behalf of Reese, but its application was denied one month later. The company also utilized international anti-terrorist strategies and tactics against NoDAPL activists. Intelligence came in the forms of flyover photography, summaries of arrests, activist activity, numbers, alleged criminal actions, and equipment. TigerSwan also provided projections of activist activity including the surveillance of social media accounts, according to the lawsuit. TigerSwan maintained the Joint Operations Command Center to coordinate security and intelligence gathering, and organized a Quick Reaction Force to respond to activist activities. TigerSwan operatives targeted individuals within the American Indian Movement, the Red Warrior Tribal security. Operatives took keen interest in Native Americans from Standing Rock, Red Warrior Tribal security, Pine Ridge Sioux, the American Indian Movement, and others from Polynesia and Palestine.

The deployment of this missile system to Standing Rock can be seen as little more than an act of intimidation. This vehicle was specifically selected and deployed to Standing Rock. Its presence cannot be discounted or overlooked. Please share this story with your friends and family so that they may see for themselves the ridiculous nature of the police state response to people protecting water. Winning this battle is as simple as choosing to abstain from the violent corrupt old system and participating in the new and peaceful system that hands the power back to the people. We feel that PIVX is this system. PIVX takes the control the banking elite has over money and gives it back to the people. It is the ultimate weapon in the battle against the money changers and information controllers because PIVX is the only cryptocurrency in existence that allows for completely anonymous storage while simultaneously paying interest.

Celebrities that have offered support include Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Shailene Woodley, and even Neil Young. Now, actress and activist Jane Fonda is expected to arrive in North Dakota within the week to help serve a Thanksgiving dinner to the protestors at Standing Rock. NativeNewsOnline reports that the two-time Academy Award-winner will visit the water protectors at the Oceti Sakowin camp as part of a delegation of 50 people from around the country. The intent is to serve a Wopila Feast to thank American Indian water protectors for their courage in defending Mother Earth. Fonda will also contribute five butchered Bison and four Mongolian yurts to the camp. As Native Village points out, Fonda is a long-time supporter of American Indian rights. In 1969, the activist supported the Alcatrez Island occupation by American Indians; this brought attention to treaty rights. And in 1970, Fonda traveled to Seattle, Washington, to offer support to a group of American Indians who occupied part of Fort Lawton to get land that was being surplussed by the United States Army. In that instance, the group succeeded. Here is a picture of her with my aunt Yet-Si-Blue (Janet McCloud) 19970. Those beautiful people are being unjustly hurt by the police. Please give them the support they need. May her bones explode. She was young and made a mistake that she has apologized for over and over again. Ridiculous.

The Vietnam war was a bad, unwarranted, war and it needed to be stopped. My boyfriend at the time was a Marine who donned a wig with several of his Marine brothers and went AWOL to come protest the war at The Ohio State University. They went to war, fought like they had been trained and, no thanks to narrow minded people like you, lived, although their lives were forever changed.

Reply mimi November 23, 2016 at 4:10 am Thank you Jane Fonda for bringing attention to the plight of the Dakota Sioux, something no major network has done and something our POTUS has failed to do. I have friends at Oceti Sakowin camp. They are there to help protect the land and the water of the Dakota Sioux. Jane, what a generous act.

Good on you Jane for putting your name in the hat of supporters and thank you to Sen Sanders for working towards a solution from a different angle of attack .

Not to mention continuous mass tear gas, rubber bullets, as well as stinger grenades and LRAND (Long Range Acoustic Device) for 3 hours. Law enforcement also shot down three media drones and targeted journalists with less lethal rounds.

I seek guidance in their intersectionality and perhaps you can do the same with mine. It was during the journey of native peoples we traveled through movements that sought sovereignty where I saw the same spirit of resilience of the Catalan people. Peaceful and well-organized movements have made their way into discourse for centuries. And they are not stopping at any time soon. We saw this in the Ghost Dance movement in the late 19th century, when Ghost Dancers used several networks of telegraphs, railroads, and mail service to spread their millenarial prophetic practice and end generations of oppression. We saw this in the Idle No More movement in 2012, when activists used new technology to draw attention to settler colonialism, oppression, and environmental injustice in Canada through flash mobs and drums in big public spaces. Relentless activism. These women that rose to protect indigenous rights inspire me and many others who strength around the world. This is what I envision for my people as well. In the face of constant abuse and oppression, we must seek stories of resilience around the world such as this one. And we must inspire each other while remaining self-sufficient and independent.

And I am one of them. I had the privilege of meeting with just a few of these beautiful tribe members (before I was immediately ignited to join them in Standing Rock) and learned of their struggles. I was inspired, touched, amazed and enraged with and for them. These people are so powerful, so strong and instantly life altering, no matter your background but as a Latinx woman I felt personally effected by their words. I looked at the faces of the Natives and I saw my ancestors. I saw people no different than my own family. I saw the same tired eyes weighed down by oppression, the same generational pain of my Latinx people. Their tears for freedom and justice were the same that ours cried when conquistadores destroyed our language, our culture, our resources, and stole our islands. They were the same tears because we are the same people. The loss of the Latinx identity is an American tragedy, a clandestine assault on our unity and our existence. They tell us Christopher Columbus discovered a land and a people who are often described monolithically, inattentively and without care. There is nowhere near the investigation into the diversity of tribes that existed here pre-colonization. This is the first step in the culture of disregard that surrounds Native history and therefore Latinx history. The genocidal attacks on these people are either untold in history books or the severity of their brutality is deeply diminished. Those were parts of my identity that were kept from me. And I know that throughout the Latinx community the same can be said for their respective tribes and those individual historical struggles. We were never told. We walk around this country with our identity in Jennifer Lopez, in the stereotypical dangerous cholo depiction, in the over-sexualized unintelligent Latinx woman, in the strictly heterosexual (and often Catholic) depiction of our families. We are never given the privilege of intersectionality and it breeds a strange and unique kind of self-hatred. And so I do not at all mean to take away from their oppression and their resistance. I passionately stand with their movement for freedom. I see strong black people in my life rise above their history. They choose to conquer it bravely and beautifully. Because they were told what they were up against. And so we either sink into indifference that has only changed because of the direct assault on our character by Donald Trump or we turn against the people who would stand with us. There is an epidemic of anti-blackness in the Latinx community that makes no sense (as most of us are historically black and even currently descendants of black people; e.g.: all Afro-Latinx people, my fellow Dominicans I am looking at you), and only serves to deepen the pain and division that destroys us. We are mestizos, a word that means a mix of races and cultures. We are black, we are indigenous and of course we have colonialist European blood in our veins as well. Just acknowledging this is such a fundamental part of our liberation and the liberation of all people. Wake up and see who you are. These fights are indeed your fights. Black lives are your lives.

They joined thousands of other protesters from around the world who were already camping at Standing Rock. The hope was that law enforcement would see themselves and rethink their role in history. They arrived Saturday morning and left Sunday afternoon, shortly before news came down that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had decided to block the pipeline route from running near Standing Rock Sioux land. He went because the Indians' sovereignty had been violated, he said Monday. The response drew an astounding coalition of cultures from across the globe, an intriguing occurrence for a sociologist. The assembled groups originated from places as far flung as Peru. The Paynes saw freelance journalists from Germany and climate scientists from Norway, along with a man from Alabama who had driven north with a shipment of sweet potatoes. The unity he saw at the camp, in the context of America's history of racial and political friction, inspired hope in Payne. The camp was surprisingly well organized, he said. His veteran status was registered among a list of social security numbers by camp organizers in order to deter fakers. His visit coincided with an influx of veterans to the protest camp, many of which were reportedly prepared to act as human shields for the protesters should a confrontation with the police turn violent. He personally observed an action on Sunday. Although some of the veterans crossed a demarcation line on the roadway, the police didn't use crowd dispersal tactics as they had before, Payne said. Conditions at the camp were very cold, so that the batteries in all three of Payne's cameras were dead after just 24 hours of shooting photos. Signs posted by American Indian tribes made it clear that photos of sacred objects and traditions were not allowed without permission. It stymied Payne's desire for candid shots, but he respected their wishes. They did chores like hauling water to earn their keep, and were sure to bring in more supplies than they used, Payne said. Although he had heard of a trend where young white people were reportedly taking advantage of the collective resources of the protest camp and treating it like a music festival, Payne didn't see evidence of that when he actually went there. The camp was surprisingly free of litter, he said. Pipelines are harmful not only because they further carbon emissions that cause climate change but also because of the risk of spills, Payne said.

Among the veterans at Standing Rock Monday was Bill Means, a Vietnam vet who returned from fighting a bloody U.S. war of aggression overseas to take on the U.S. government at Wounded Knee. Bill Means is a founding member of the International Indian Treaty Council and co-founder of the American Indian Movement (AIM). Means is a key adviser to the Standing Rock Tribe on their resistance to the pipeline. I spoke with him shortly after he met with the Standing Rock leaders this week about future strategies for the tribe on its continuing resistance to the pipeline. ---------------------- Q: Bill Means, it is good to speak with you again. I believe you were in Vietnam with Wesley Clark, Sr. Here you have his son asking for forgiveness. Bill Means: I feel a brotherhood to those veterans. I was there in Vietnam representing the United States, but one of the things that was beautiful about coming home from that terrible war was that our people still honored us, not because we fought for America but because we fought for the honor of our people. When I returned from Vietnam my cousin gave me an Indian name, my friend gave me a horse, and I was welcomed back to the community with open arms. I think that helped us in our healing from what they now call post traumatic stress. I feel proud that these young men decided to come to Standing Rock, and stand with the Oceti Sakowin Camp which in itself was a tremendous show of support. I saw at least ten, twelve charter buses just in one area, filled with veterans. Some of them had their wives, or some were women veterans, some were men from different wars. I met a farmer from Iowa, a World War II veteran, who said he had to join the fight against this black snake, this pipeline, because the corporations had taken his land under what they call eminent domain. But it was for a highway, they took some school or churches. But this is one of those times when generations stand up for what they believe. Not very many times in my lifetime have I been part of such a beautiful, non-violent movement. We kind of faced that here. We had a tremendous amount of old AIMsters, people who had experienced Wounded Knee, and also young people that had only heard about it. But clearer heads prevailed. We want to use prayer. But it was hard to hold back the young troops. They were like a bunch of young colts, ready to charge. I think that was a difficult part of this movement back in our day in the 1960s. The idea of using prayer and non-violence as a weapon was kind of mind blowing, even to the police. And so they incited violence, and even used deadly force, including military-type weapons, and dogs on our people. Not unlike ole Bull Connor who stopped people crossing a bridge with dogs. That frontier mentality is still here, that feeling that anybody that supports Indian people or environmental issues must be a criminal. And so they brought their dogs, and they brought their smoke grenades, and they brought their rubber bullets, and they brought their tear gas... Q: . . . and cages Means:. . . So I think this is a very profound lesson for our people, that again we faced these things but together with peoples from all walks of life we attained a small, temporary victory. Means: Well, I think we have to honor the wishes of the Standing Rock people. To take what they learned here at Standing Rock, to take that medicine feeling of camaraderie, of sacredness, of learning things you learn about how Lakota people look at the elements, that protect our people, like water, like the land. Take what you learned and go back to your community, and in some way teach that to your family, to your church, to whomever that you can reach. They may be called back later. But there is legal strategy in place. There are cases to be fought and won in the courts. And so I think, you know, Standing Rock people have borne the burden of this whole action, and the disruption of their communities, which they supported, almost wholeheartedly, with very little dissent. But yet it is time to honor their wishes, they would like to have their community back, from the people. You know the winter is not as big a deal as everybody says, because Lakota people have been surviving this region since time immemorial. The issue is that we all have a home. Also, all these issues are almost in every state. In fact the girl who had her arm almost blown off was part of a pipeline fight centered around Boston, Massachusetts. She was showing the type of solidarity that we need now to expand this movement. The Navajo Nation, they need help. These people all need help. And through our experiences at Standing Rock we have built expertise. We need to take what people have learned and put it into active use.

BuzzFeed News identified more than 60 Facebook pages with more than 6 million fans that are generating money either by selling counterfeit Native American merchandise, or by driving traffic to ad-filled websites that in some cases have little or nothing to do with Native American issues. Native designers say their work is being stolen and resold, and that some pages falsely claim to donate proceeds to the protesters at Standing Rock. He said some Facebook pages have even taken photos of his models and photoshopped different clothing on them. Erica Moore with two people wearing one of her Standing Rock T-shirt designs. She said copies of her designs soon began showing up on Facebook and elsewhere. BuzzFeed News tracked some of the worst offending Facebook pages to owners in Vietnam. It promotes its T-shirts by photoshopping them on celebrities such as The Rock, Johnny Depp, Mark Wahlberg, and others. Many of its recent posts about clothing comment on the Standing Rock protest, though there is no evidence that the people running the page donate any proceeds to the protesters. BuzzFeed News messaged the page on Facebook and the person who replied introduced themselves as a woman in Michigan named Maria Torres who claims to be Native American on her Facebook profile. The profile appears to only have been created in March of this year and primarily shares merchandise being promoted by the Like If You Love Native Americans page. The account also reposts content and merchandise from a page called Wolves In Native American Culture which points to a domain name registered to the same person in Vietnam. The person then denied stealing designs from Native artists. The person said they simply find Native American T-shirts that have already been uploaded to SunFrog and collect them on one page, earning a commission each time they sell. SunFrog is one of several websites that enable anyone to to upload a design and then offer print-on-demand ordering for a range of clothing. He pointed to a form on its website that anyone can use to make a claim. He also said anyone who falsely claims to sell clothing in support of a cause will have their account closed and SunFrog will donate their earnings to charity. Yodzevicis said SunFrog has seen an increase in infringing designs and false charity claims related to Standing Rock. One of the bigger pages identified by BuzzFeed News is called Indigenous People of America and has over 750,000 fans. It shares a steady stream of news related to events in Standing Rock, but under many of its posts it also promotes the sale of a knockoff of a shirt created by actor Shailene Woodley to raise funds for Standing Rock. The only official seller of the Woodley shirt is Omaze, yet the design can be found for sale on many other online clothing sites as well as on Amazon. SunFrog removed a version of the shirt for sale on its site after being alerted to it by BuzzFeed News, though other copies of the design remain for sale on the site. Another big Facebook page hawking inauthentic Native American goods is Native American Indians, which has over 360,000 fans and promotes merchandise from a store called NativeThing.com. Once they receive their order people realize it was made in China, gives off a noxious odor, and that the company subsequently refuses to accept returns. Many other pages pursue a similar strategy of building up an audience with Native content and then trying to sell them shirts and other items that are often rip-offs of Native designs. One newer page is called I Stand with Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and shares a steady diet of news about the protest mixed with constant pleas for people to show their support by buying shirts for the cause. The page did not respond to a question about whether it donates any money to the tribe. Along with stealing the work of Native artists, and the likenesses of models and celebrities, some scammers even used a photo of the first Native American federal judge to create fake profiles to help spread their content. Her photo has been used on at least three fake Facebook profiles, one of which lists its two only friends as two young men in Kosovo. One of the largest networks of Native American Facebook pages initially identified by BuzzFeed News belonged to two young men in Kosovo. At the time of the interview, their pages had close to 2 million fans.

Aaron Silva, a Native American and the co-founder of The NTVS clothing brand in Minnesota, said the dubious Native American sellers often have one or several large Facebook pages to use to promote the merchandise. Silva also said these pages spend money to create sponsored Facebook posts that promote the item for sale to large numbers of people. One of its current sponsored posts shows photos of Bernie Sanders and celebrities with the Shailene Woodley shirt. This sponsored post for a stolen design has received over 125,000 reactions, 15,000 comments, and close to 18,000 shares as of this writing. It had over 33,000 reactions, nearly 4,000 comments, and over 8,000 shares. These sponsored posts also help grow the number of fans for that page: When BuzzFeed News first found the Native American Cultures page roughly two weeks ago, it had just over 57,000 fans. It now has over 72,000. It has close to 12,000 reactions, just over 500 comments, and 2,100 shares as of this writing. The comment thread was soon filled with people sharing other examples of suspect pages, and of designers talking about how they too had their work stolen. Silva and others have also tried to contact T-shirt sites such as SunFrog and TeeChip to get their designs removed. They said the takedown forms and procedures take up a lot of their time. Yodzevicis from SunFrog said their reporting form has only a few fields to complete and submissions are checked roughly every hour. He also said the company is working to implement a procedure whereby any money earned from a stolen design will be sent to the original artist. Silva said Facebook is easier to deal with, but that it only removes the offending post rather than an entire page. Yazzie has also tried directly contacting the Facebook pages that promote his stolen designs for sale. But at most he says they will delete the post with his design and just upload it again later. For his part, Silva is amazed at how so many people in different parts of the world have discovered that dubious Native American Facebook pages, websites, and merchandise can be a moneymaker.

Vic Camp, a member of the Oglala Nation, would greet us. Load your pipes and meet at the South Gate. Before the camps got bigger, the wakeup would only be played on the Sacred Fire Circle speakers. But as the camps grew, and thousands upon thousands came, announcers started driving around the camps with speakers in their trucks, so everyone would hear the call. The International Indigenous Youth Council camp would wake each other up in our council tipi, and make sure we were all at the morning prayers. We were all there for the Earth. For the People. For the water. I spent 5 months at Oceti Sakowin, from August to December 2016. Everybody would gather at the South Gate every morning, and we would sing the Lakota pipe-loading song with the pipe carriers as they loaded their canupas, sacred pipes. We would smoke canupa, and pray with each other and for each other. We would pray for safety for ourselves and Mother Earth. Then we would head out to either halt construction for the day, or to pray where pipeline workers were desecrating the earth. The view of Oceti Sakowin Camp from Media Hill, as greater numbers of Water Protectors began to arrive. (Photo by Andrew Ironshell) So much love was shared by everyone. We gathered and shared laughs. Not much changed after the thousands came either, except that there was a lot more love and laughter, and then some. There was a sense of breathtaking goodness when you drove down into that river valley and saw the tipis and tents set up by the thousands. A layer of campfire smoke came every evening along with a murmur of songs coming from all the different camps of different nations. At the Sacred Fire Circle there was always another nation sharing a story or singing a song. There were elders sitting around sharing stories of the old times. You could walk up to any camp and share a meal. It was like the old days. We traded food for labor. We bartered songs for stories. We had round dances. We had socials. The young sat with the old and learned what it was to be an Indigenous person. We learned culture and traditions. We learned how to live in a good way with good intentions. We learned that we are people of the Earth and we need to go back to that. We lived like old souls. We were all there for the Earth. For the People. For the water. We were there for the future. It was a feeling I will never ever forget for as long as I am alive. Literally, there were Indigenous nations from across the Americas that came to be with each other again, just like we did before colonization. Pre-Columbian ways were being brought back and it was so goddamn amazing. Every day when we would come back to camp from wherever the construction was happening, there would be food and our family waiting for us. People would greet you, tell you that they love you. They would smudge you off with cedar and sage and offer you food, ask you how your day was. Some of us have never known what a real family felt like, some of us have never felt that kind of love before. No matter what kind of trauma went on that day, we had love back at camp waiting for us to return. A Water Protector at Oceti Sakowin raises a fist at a surveillance helicopter. (Photo by Andrew Ironshell) There were times when every encounter with law enforcement was worse than the last. Over and over again, it got worse every time. More people got hurt, more people got arrested, the jails got colder, and there were more and more officers showing up. Sometimes they would tap into our radio conversations. So many things went undocumented, or were censored out through mainstream news outlets and social media sites. But no matter what was happening at the actions, we stayed unarmed, we stayed in prayer. This was a ceremony. It was a prayerful, traditional ceremony. We were in ceremony constantly. Every time you stepped foot in those camps, it was a ceremony. We prayed. We danced. We shared stories and songs. We shared culture and traditions. We were always in prayer. Always. Praying for the water. For the people. For life. This is why weapons and other explicit items were not allowed in the camps. Well, the same rules applied for the camps. That was a sacred place. It still is. The spirits were there guiding us, praying with us, singing with us, and loving with us. We had designated persons that held security positions, and they would be set up at the entrance (North Gate) and exit (South Gate). At the entrance, they would ask why you were there and who you knew in camp. They would ask if you had any drugs, alcohol or weapons with you. Just like the Wounded Knee Occupation, it was a moment that created change. A fire was lit in Oceti Sakowin, a fire that every single person who was there, who watched, who supported, carries with them everywhere that they go. They spread that fire in the work that they do for our youth, for our Earth, for the world.

The Oceti Sakowin protest camp, whose residents fought the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline project, has been cleared by law enforcement. The project and the protests over it have generated worldwide attention. But by any reasonable standard, the project is economically important. By any realistic measure, it's safe. By any fair-minded assessment, it was approved through a legal, lawful process. We understand many Americans disapprove of the project. We support their legal and moral right to oppose it through peaceful, legal protest. We live, thank goodness, in a free country. But many of the protests were neither peaceful nor legal. Just about everyone familiar with North Dakota agriculture has at least one story about farmers, ranchers and other rural residents affected by the protests. The Morton County Sheriff's Department and North Dakota Department of Agriculture say 544 Morton County households were affected by the protests. There also are continuing problems with possible pest-infested firewood, as well as hundreds of loads of garbage left behind when the camp was cleared out. Most of the protesters did not cause problems. More than 10,000 people are estimated to have spent time at the protest camps at any one time, which means the hundreds of related arrests account for less than 10 percent of the people involved. We're not able to look into protesters' hearts and minds. We can't be sure of their motives. But we suspect most were driven by sincere conviction, others by trendy hipsterism. Though we disagree with the true believers, we respect your passion. Move on to your next look-at-me-I'm-so-cool crusade, which, if we're lucky, will be far away. That alienated and angered many people who had been neutral or lukewarm on the project. North Dakota is rich in energy and agricultural resources. Ag and energy prices are depressed now, but other projects taking advantage of those resources are sure to be proposed in the future. Each will need to be evaluated openly and fairly on its own merits. Each will need to be approved legally before it's implemented. We'll almost certainly deal with other mass protests, albeit on a smaller scale than DAPL, given North Dakota's ag and energy resources. Our best advice to future protesters: Learn from mistakes made by DAPL critics. Disrupting the lives and businesses of farmers and ranchers hurts your cause. We all want the best for this land, and farmers and ranchers know better than anyone the importance of our water and soil health. Future environmentally minded protesters would be better served to respect agriculturalists who care for the land and animals raised on it. Engage with the regulatory process from the beginning rather than giving it a dramatic aftermath. And leave the land in better shape than you found it in any situation. We hope the cleanup and the coming change of season, bringing with it fresh grass and new calves, will bring renewal to the land as well as the people. And with the garbage hauled away, we hope everyone involved can feel a lighter load and move forward."}, {"URL": "https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/divest_from_dapl_23/?wJiRbcb", "Timestamp": "20180918222702", "Sentences": "Got it We use cookies to analyse how visitors use this website and to help us provide you the best possible experience.

Unfortunately, the signal has been weak and is suspected of being interfered with by unknown parties. If there is a real need for wifi, people head to the casino 10 minutes south by car. Not being a technologist myself, I spoke to Lisha Sterling from Geeks Without Bounds in order to understand what is happening and who is responsible. Sterling has a background in technology reaching back to 1993 and has degrees in Latin American Studies and Migration Studies. GWB is a merger of her humanitarian work and technology background. Upon arrival to Standing Rock, her phone crashed. I asked Sterling to help me understand what might be causing our cell phones to be acting up. People have reported having their phones misbehaving in odd ways. Sterling has personally heard from hundreds of people about their cell phones acting odd. Batteries dying without warning are the most common reports. According to Sterling, one of the reasons there is so much political change going on in the world right now, the reason that movements like the Arab Spring or Occupy were possible, is because of the power of instant global communication through the internet. Both of those movements happened in mostly urbanized areas. Standing Rock has both geography and non-urbanized infrastructure restricting it from reaching the outside world. The main camps are in a basin-shaped section of land, beneath the cell signal, and there are few internet service providers nearby. There is a climate of surveillance in the occupation camps. Overhead, an airplane circles every hour or so. As it passes over, Sterling reports there is an increase in cell phone battery deaths, and even car batteries dying. The plane flies at night without lights on. Helicopters fly over the camp taking photos. There are very likely infiltrators from DAPL and the government in camp with the water protectors. Whatever information is being gathered, it is a bonus to the scare tactic of living beneath a security apparatus. Water protectors looking north to Oceti Sakowin. There is no shortage of theories. It works by mimicking a cell tower, causing the phone to connect to it and brokering the connection to the actual cell tower. In this way, all data, text and voice traffic can be monitored if it is not encrypted. This is one theory to explain the oddities in device operation, but has not yet been confirmed. The Freedom of Information Act requests that were sent to the North Dakota State Police, Morton County Sheriff and the Nation Guard were all rejected on grounds of security. The Electronic Frontier Foundation is currently conducting an investigation. Learn how to use it for voice calls as well. -Turn off Automatic Updates in your Settings. IMSI-catchers can inject software via updates. -Backup your phone to your computer before you come out here. The contradiction between the last two is difficult to work around. You need system updates to protect from the most recent security threats. However, I myself received a message for a system update that does not coincide with any release from Apple. Catch-22s like this lend themselves to the atmosphere of suspicion. There is an invisible antagonist winking at us, but no one knows exactly what that means, but we know how it feels. When I got the message my stomach sank. According to the report, someone in Belcourt, ND, was trying to access my email. The unknown device came from Fort Totten, North Dakota, and was registered to the State of North Dakota ITD. A week later, one of my collogues at Oceti Sakowin Camp Media had their Paypal account hacked into. The perpetrator used funds to purchase goods and drain the account. The account was receiving donations to buy a winter structure. People around camp reported similar stories to me. One man had his messages to a relative deleted from their device out-of-state while he was in jail. Another girl reported her device would ask for login data for facebook and google, but if she closed and opened the programs they would work fine. One woman I spoke to reported that her phone call to her mother had been redirected to another camper in Standing Rock whom she did not know. Subtle intimidation like this is creates a train of logic that leads into darker places. Unfortunately, there is another question that is important to address. November 29th, 2016.

So, while Sanders was successful in pushing political foe Hillary Rodham Clinton to more progressive stances, he was never a real threat to her campaign. Not only that, but he failed to make real inroads with the folks whose backs the Democratic Party stands on. This is the part where you conjure an image of a black auntie. Following the stunning win of the hatemonger and Republican nominee for president in the 2016 election, Sanders regurgitated the very rhetoric that made him a distant-second-place primary loser in the first place. Hillary Clinton ran an unsuccessful campaign, but to say she ran a bad campaign is disingenuous. According to the results of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, sure. Advertisement That said, Clinton had nearly 3 million more votes than our president-elect and lost by about 80,000 votes in three states heavily affected by voter suppression, an issue that the likes of Sanders and others failed to truly speak on, at their own peril. Clinton achieved this feat despite a media consumed by a nonissue about her email server as it gleefully reported on stolen material secured through hackers so ordered by the Russian government. The man is not saying anything new or remotely insightful. Clinton performed far better than he arguably ever could have with a diverse coalition that he never enjoyed or made a real effort to build. Advertisement To wit, during a recent town hall with CNN, Sanders was asked if the Democrats, like the Republicans immediately following the swearing-in of President Barack Obama, should obstruct the new commander in chief. Republicans were wrong to obstruct Obama, especially when you consider how willing he was to compromise for the sake of the greater good. We see how well that turned out. Now, as we look at a man building an administration very much in line with the demagoguery and exploitation his campaign was known for, Sanders is scolding Democrats based on mythology while pretending that he can get something down with the bigot ruler-in-waiting. He likes the attention too much for that. At this point, he very much just enjoys the sound of his own voice and the attention. And in hindsight, I wish I had never donated to his campaign.

Veterans have been at the camp since it was first created, but after a fellow named Wes Clark, Jr. made a Facebook event with a date to attend, we figured it would be worth returning earlier than planned. We traveled to Standing Rock to stand with the people, however, most if not all of us had no idea that the gathering was staged for an entirely different purpose: the Wes Clark Jr. Show. We knew something was up when Clark appeared for the first time at a muster at Sitting Bull College. There he talked at length about himself, how hard his travels were, he apologized for his appearance and lack of showering, then finished by asking an edler Sioux woman to be his grandma before giving her the key to his Los Angeles home. We knew something was up when every scheduled meeting at Oceti Sakowin camp was cancelled, no directions were ever given, no comm was ever established, and Veterans were left hanging to adapt and overcome their situations (which they did naturally with ease, as real leaders emerged). Veterans who traveled to Standing Rock have much to be proud about, because they boldly and courageously protected their fellow citizens against an out-of-control federal government. They stood up for the Constitution. And they did so without acknowledgement, without fanfare, and without ceremony. Meanwhile, Wes Clark made the entire weekend about Wes Clark. He is an embarrasment to all things genuine and honest. He is a scam artist. He is a tool. That is why we are calling him out. Give Standing Rock Veterans a round of applause.

In reality, however, the Obama administration has quietly punished Mr Netanyahu for his misbehaviour. Notably, Israel has been forced to promise not to approach Congress for extra funds. Israel will soon have to buy all its armaments from the US, ending what amounted to a subsidy to its own arms industry. But the US expects a return on its massive investment. A nuclear-armed Iraq or Syria would have deterred later US-backed moves at regime overthrow, as well as countering the strategic advantage Israel derives from its own nuclear arsenal. Public funds are siphoned off to let Israel buy goodies from American arms makers. That, in turn, serves as a shop window for other customers and spurs an endless and lucrative game of catch-up in the rest of the Middle East. It stood up to Mr Netanyahu over the Iran deal but will not risk a damaging clash over Palestinian statehood. Some believe that Mr Obama signed the aid package to win the credibility necessary to overcome his domestic Israel lobby and pull a rabbit from the hat: an initiative, unveiled shortly before he leaves office, that corners Mr Netanyahu into making peace. Hopes have been raised by an expected meeting at the United Nations in New York on Wednesday. But their first talks in 10 months are planned only to demonstrate unity to confound critics of the aid deal. If Mr Obama really wanted to pressure Mr Netanyahu, he would have used the aid agreement as leverage. Now Mr Netanyahu need not fear US financial retaliation, even as he intensifies effective annexation of the West Bank.

Robin Wall KimmererKathleen Dean Moore posted Nov 05, 2016 Two lines, facing each other on a North Dakota highway. On one side, concrete barriers protect a row of armored vehicles and helmeted police with assault rifles. On the other, a young man rides a white horse whose legs are stained with blood. A woman, wearing a scarf to protect her lungs from tear gas, wafts sage smoke over a boy to give him strength, wash away hate, and remind him of his sacred purpose. Here, on a highway stretching across trampled prairie grass, the fundamental contest of our time is playing out. The fundamental contest of our time is playing out. The space between the lines vibrates with tensions of race, historical trauma, broken treaties, money and politics, love and fear. But the underlying issue that charges the air, mixing with the smells of tear gas and sage, is the global contest between two deeply different ideas about the true meaning of land. On one side is the unquestioned assumption that land is merely a warehouse of lifeless materials that have been given to (some of) us by God or conquest, to use without constraint. On this view, human happiness is best served by whatever economy most efficiently transforms water, soils, minerals, wild lives, and human yearning into corporate wealth. And so it is possible to love the bottom line on a quarterly report so fiercely that you will call out the National Guard to protect it. The fertile soil, the fresh water, the clear air, the creatures, swift or rooted: they require gratitude and veneration. These gifts are not commodities, like scrap iron and sneakers. The land is sacred, a living breathing entity, for whom we must care, as she cares for us. And so it is possible to love land and water so fiercely you will live in a tent in a North Dakota winter to protect them. It may turn out that the cracks in that stretch of two-lane highway mark a giant crack in time, when one set of assumptions about reality snaps and is replaced by another. This, like all times of paradigm shift, is an unsettled time, a time of shouting and police truncheons, as privileged people defend the assumptions that have served them royally. But once people accept with heart and mind that land is our teacher, our mother, our garden, our pharmacy, our church, our cradle and our grave, it becomes unthinkable to destroy it. This vision threatens the industrial worldview more than anything else. Indigenous people are saying, there are honorable and enduring lifeways that beckon to people who are weary of destruction. Everyone can join the people of Standing Rock and say No. No more wrecked land. No more oil spills. No more poisoned wells. We can say Yes. Yes, we are all in this together. Yes, we can all stand on moral ground. Yes, we can all be protectors of the water and protectors of the silently watching future. Right here, between the barricades, we are offered a choice. On the highway, a warrior steps around the concrete barrier, offering a sage bundle that trails white smoke. Approaching a figure in riot gear, he extends the blessing to the officer, letting the smoke wash over him. To give him strength. To wash away hate. To remind him of his purpose. No Paywall. No Ads.

These tribes have been met with rubber bullets, pepper spray, attack dogs, and water canons for just peacefully protesting a monster oil pipeline slicing through their sacred waters and lands. But President Obama can stop this crisis with the stroke of a pen, and he's coming under increasing pressure from the Democratic Party to act. No other movement can get a million people to show this is a concern in every country on earth and deliver it to the White House before the deadline. Let's get Obama to go to Standing Rock, ensure a full indigenous consultation, and stop this pipeline for good.

Cadden introduced Little Thunder. After Nyoni spoke, several area high school students read aloud a list of demands prepared by organizers. Among these was a call for TD Bank to withdraw funding from DAPL and the Vermont Gas Systems pipeline, and for the State of Vermont to remove its money from TD Bank. Coravos led a prayer and water ceremony in which marchers took a bowl of water from the Cannonball River in North Dakota and deposited it into the Winooski. On Sunday afternoon, Coravos had participated in a similar prayer ritual at Burlington's Main Street Landing Union Station, collaborating with local community members including Charlie Megeso, Laura Krouse and Fearn Lickfield, director of the Green Mountain Druid Order. click to enlarge Rachel Jones Protestors hold signs on Main Street in Montpelier.

Shortly after noon, some in the crowd went to a second TD Bank location at Main and School streets, where five people used PVC piping to lock themselves together to block drive-through banking traffic. At least eight people were arrested at the State and Main location, and the branch remained blocked by protestors and closed for the day. Those at the State and School Street location declared their intent to remain in formation until closing time at 5 p.m. A bank representative at the State and Main location declined Seven Days' request for comment. click to enlarge Rachel Jones TD Bank at State and Main Streets in Montpelier Correction, December 8, 2016: An earlier version of this story misspelled Charlie Megeso's name.

We met when she asked to hitch a ride with me to the casino, ten miles away from the main camp, Oceti Sakowin. The 20-year-old is finding a sense of purpose for the first time through the Standing Rock movement. Every time we talked, I was even more blown away by her wisdom and bravery. Sarah Shomin: Social media is what kind of kick-started it for me because you got to see in detail what was really going on out here. I was scrolling the Internet. One hour turned into three, three turned into six. For one, I can survive with no electricity. I did not know that. You know, I can chop wood now. I can do it. I grew up really culturally detached. I grew up a product of history, they really wiped us out. My parents are die-hard Catholics. I really like that. SS: You meet people from everywhere. I found my first love out here. Everyone helps each other out. People actually care. SS: It definitely kinda sucked. I did what I had to do every day. I went to work. Came home. Did my taxes. I felt like I was doing everything I had to do. I felt like it revolved around money a lot. So that was in the back of my mind too. I almost feel like I had no purpose before this. Yeah. Here I actually feel alive. AW: I can relate. SS: Yeah. I get up with my man in the morning. AW: Tell me how Standing Rock functions as a community. SS: Yeah, on my way here I was going through so many emotions. When I came out here, I felt like I kissed my family goodbye. I refuse to pass this down. We can fight this now, man. We can make it easier for them. This is way past us. SS: This is about the future kids. The youth, the animals, the plants. Mother Earth herself. SS: The friends. The round dances.

The incident took place on the Backwater Bridge near the Oceti Sakowin encampment. The bridge has been closed since late October when a clash with protestors and police in riot gear led to its forcible shut down by the authorities. The protestors were attempting to clear the bridge as they claim the blockade prevents aid and supplies from reaching their encampments and that it is harming the local economy of nearby Cannonball, ND. After a brief confrontation with police, protestors allegedly succeeded in removing some vehicles from the highway blockade. Soon after, heavily militarized police appeared, who targeted the protestors in an all-out assault. Tear gas, pepper spray, concussion grenades, rubber bullets were used on the protestors, despite the below freezing temperatures, in a police attempt to clear protestors from the bridge. By midnight, an estimated 167 protestors were injured. Medics confirmed that a 13 year old girl was shot in the face, though they did not confirm if it was a rubber bullet or live ammunition. Medics on site also said that police had targeted the face and legs of protestors. Seven were eventually hospitalized, three of whom are said to be elders of the Standing Rock Sioux, the tribe that has led the protest against the pipeline. One of the elders suffered cardiac arrest at the scene, though medics successfully resuscitated him, though he remains in critical condition. The assault was live-streamed on Facebook though Facebook eventually cut off the feed. The brutality has already generated a firestorm of outrage and criticism on social media as the increasingly violent crackdowns on the peaceful protestors have become a national disgrace. Dakota Access is only the most recent example. It catches ground on fire and while the water cannon is being used to soak peaceful water protectors another group of water protectors stamp out the fire to prevent it spreading. This shows the story of water cannons to put out fires to be untrue.

The second is that my wife and I are closing our accounts with Citizens Bank. These two seemingly disparate subjects are related. For months, there has been a standoff between the indigenous people of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota and their supporters on one side, and those backing the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on the other. The Native Americans are blocking the pipeline with the goal of protecting their water and the water for millions of people downstream, their burial grounds and their land under their treaty rights. On the other side, the DAPL is buttressed by an enormous accumulation of wealth and political power. Now the Trump administration has jumped in with both feet on the side of the banks and oil companies. My wife and I are joining with people around the country who are withdrawing their accounts from the banks supporting the pipeline. Specifically, this pipeline is going through land that by treaty belongs to the Sioux. The U.S. has historically made treaties with the American Indian and then has systematically broken those treaties, taken more land and made more treaties which were again broken. We have used our economic, military, legal and police powers to abuse and marginalize these people. We want to be part of a country that treats all its people with respect, integrity and honesty. One way to do that is to oppose the pipeline. The Sioux are aware that pipelines break and leak. The native Americans rightly want to protect their water and the water for all the people living downstream on the Missouri River, but also implicit in their stand is the recognition that clean water is more important than oil. They are not just attempting to block a pipeline, but are sounding an alarm that the fracked oil these pipelines carry is an assault on the entire ecosystem that sustains all life. They are warning us that our present patterns of behavior put us on an unsustainable trajectory of destroying the interconnected web of life on which we are all dependent. The indigenous people have always had a sense of the sacredness of the earth and through that a closer relationship with other forms of life on the planet than we Caucasians have had. Their culture has recognized the relationship and interdependency of all forms of life. They have seen other life forms as being their brothers and sisters who need to be treated with care. In this time, when before our eyes, the climate and life on our planet is changing even more rapidly than the scientists predicted, these disrespected native people who have been pushed to the fringes of society, appear to be the ones with the wisdom and courage to sound the alarm and lead us toward a sustainable vision of life on our mother earth. However, as officers of a bank, these spiritual values may not be persuasive for you. So, in monetary terms, we are already paying for climate change. Extreme weather events that are intrinsically a part of global warming are already costing many billions. We are already paying for extreme weather events of larger and more powerful hurricanes, droughts, longer lasting and massive wildfires caused by droughts, microburst rain storms with heavy rainfall causing floods, and much more. With extreme weather events come extreme costs. One would hardly know how to estimate all the costs for abnormal weather events we have witnessed in recent years. Your children and grandchildren will see these events increase in frequency and intensity, and in one way or another will be paying for them. The profit Citizens Bank may earn from the pipeline investments will mean destruction and massive costs for the country and the planet. However much you love and want good things for your grandchildren, the investments that you are making through Citizens Bank in these oil companies are creating an unlivable world, undermining life on the planet and, subsequently, the life that you want for your grandchildren. Exxon, now Exxon Mobil, has known since 1977 that carbon dioxide from oil causes climate change. Yet Exxon executives covered that up and denied what they knew to be true. As the decision makers of Citizens Bank, I encourage you to choose a different moral path. Invest in industries that will heal the earth. Become a bank your grandchildren will be proud of. Be leaders you can be proud of."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/249480615t?referring_akid=.7451423.9qCenu", "Timestamp": "20180919001700", "Sentences": "Credo Action Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument.

In fact disappointment becomes a way of life, just another shoulder shrug and onto the next hurdle. Of course you are always hoping it will be different this time, despite the odds. Not unlike the gambler that know the house always wins. But then, the unexpected happens. This is what happened to me when I heard that the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline will not continue at Standing Rock because the easement to the company has been denied. I had to let it sink in. As I think about this question, images of people at Standing Rock pop up. I see Blue Owl holding her new born baby, the first baby to be born at the camp at standing rock. She named her son Mni Wiconi which means water is life. I see women stomping their feet, shaking their bodies and singing, while they perform the sacred jingle dance. I see shadows of grandmothers reflected on the walls of a teepee. The teepee representing the womb, from which one is reborn every day. I see the US veteran who walked up to the razor sharp barbed wire wearing his uniform and holding the US flag. I am the first of many warriors to come. These are people I have never met, yet I see their faces and hear their voices. I would even consider them my friends. So basically I owe them big time for taking on the cold, the pain, the aggravation, while I sit comfortably at my desk. Spiritual Bankruptcy 1,7 M people have checked in at Standing Rock with their Facebook accounts. Those millions of people, and I count myself among them, more than anything want to know there is hope. And we are looking at those who traditionally root our beliefs to the land and water. It is not surprising that it has hit a sensitive chord in America and Europe alike, increasingly secular societies in which religious meaning has been pushed back to the private domain. Collective forms of religion are at best associated with backwardness and at worst with fundamentalist extremism. Meanwhile there are a lot of lonely spiritual people out there. Sharing your yoga studio is not the same as sharing a dream, a vision, a belonging. In a society that is lost, 1.7 M people have found a beacon. A few years back some of these people were part of the occupy movement. I was also one of them. First, the occupy movement never had a grounding. And most of the participants were struggling to begin to understand the issues at hand. As a result confusion dominated my conversations, which ranged from right out crazy to very intellectual. Water and subsequently food is as real as it gets. A water dystopia will make you wish for a financial crisis. Second, and more importantly the occupy movement had a different personality, it was angry, it was masculine, it was white and not very lovable. Although it was non-violent, anger meant that there was little constructive dialogue. Just like the Lakota Sioux women that I saw perform their jingle dance. At occupy you saw masks, at Standing Rock you see faces that have nothing to hide. I doubted posting this when I heard of the oil spill that took place 150 miles from Standing Rock at a branch of the Missouri river. Everything the people at standing Rock are trying to prevent seems to have happened. But in a way it is good that this spill happened before the eyes of the world. Because in North Dakota alone there were a 150 oil spills last year that we never heard of. Now that we know, it is a very painful reminder that water is a right, but not a given. And if we do not change the way our environment is sold off at a sales prices to big companies and financial institutions, we are going to be denied the fundamentals of life. This has nothing to do with right or left wing politics, it has to do with power and powerlessness. We need Standing Rock to keep standing. The leadership of Standing Rock is encouraging its members to go home. The main reason being that the increasing group of protestors is creating a burden on the ecosystem. As they return home, 1.7 M people like me remain sitting at their desk and I wonder what we can do. Looking for inspiration I attended my first a water ceremony yesterday. There was a child pooring water in a bowl. Her mother looked up at the grey sky with a look of pain in her face. Drums were beating. These people were not native Americans, they were Dutch people in my home town. I left not knowing what to make of it, but it felt good to be standing for 2,5 hours, rather than sitting. Still, I am not Lakota Sioux, none the less I share their believe in the sacredness of water. Still, I spend significantly more time looking at my computer. While I do, thoughts and information are free-flowing together to create article, ideas and projects. Like water I can flow anywhere. So I have decided to be a water keeper, but one in my own right. But if all of us 1.7 M flow like water we can create a rapid undercurrent that cuts through rock. The Sami are a Nordic indigenous group and together with overall public pressure were the reason for DNB to pull out of DAPL. The Rockefeller foundation has just announced that it will divest completely from fossil fuels. Ironically finance could play an important role in pushing the energy transition forward. But that is not where I expect the leadership. I expect to find it with those who have always led us: with the keepers of the earth and water, the keepers of our spirit. Standing Rock to me has shown how much they are tied together and how strong they can be if they are united. I think as a novice water keeper I can learn a lot from them. I hope they will keep filling my inbox with prayers and wisdom. I hope they will continue flowing once they stop standing. More than anything I want to believe spirit can prevail over greed.

It is important to understand that many people have experienced trauma in the past that play a role in their beliefs. It must be mentioned that Natives bring a whole new need for trauma-informed care, information that is needed at the table, as they and their ancestors have experienced historical trauma for generations. Much as those in Europe whose relatives suffered through the Holocaust, trauma can be passed on genetically from parent to child. Native Americans have experienced not only trauma, but circumstances that also hinder the healing that is needed for recovery. So, as we move forward in developing programming and care, we must also remember to make decisions that will benefit all peoples instead of pushing others, like the American Indians and Alaskan Natives, out by not understanding what they and their ancestry have experienced. While at Standing Rock, I made several observations that I want to share with you. September 8, 2016 I had come from Fargo after a presentation, traveled through Mandan, SD, South N. Highway 6, onto 24 East to 1806, which was just a few miles from the Sacred Stone Camp. The drive was nice, but on Highway 6, while I was getting close to Highway 24, I noticed a large dark line across the land, stretching diagonally from the NW to the SE. The Dakota Access Pipeline Project (DAPL) will run a 1,172 mile pipeline carrying crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The pipeline will travel across the sacred sites and traditional lands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribes in North and South Dakota. It will also travel under the tribe's primary source of drinking water, the Missouri River. As I saw this dark line through the land, it reminded me of the railroad long ago, crossing Native lands for the first time as an Iron Horse. Metal brings war, I thought, as it makes sense. I began to feel sorry for Mother Earth and what people were doing to her. Oil has leaked in many places, I thought, polluting the lands of our descendants to come. I wondered what they would say to the builders, politicians, and leaders of the U.S., when that comes. I could swear I smelled sickness in the air, so pungent and overwhelming. The image of a black snake popped into my head, as I remembered a dream. As I crested the hill on Highway 1806, I saw a spectacular view, which quickly made me think of the long history of Native American blood that was spilled, trying to protect the land from the conquering Europeans. I quickly set my mind again to take in the site and memories to tell my children, grandchildren, and family. As I crossed the river bridge, I thought, this is like a large pow-wow grounds. I saw the first gate and tried to enter, but they told me to go through the other gate, so I turned around and went a bit further down the road. As I pulled in, I asked where I could park for the rest of the day. They pointed and said, right over there, but be careful, as some areas are muddy. I said thanks and went to park. I got out and heard the beautiful songs playing, and every once in a while, heard a speaker on the mic, stating for all to be careful near the trees and warning people to be careful near the river. I told myself, this is much like a pow-wow. I began walking towards different flags blowing in the wind, which were attached atop a pole or campsite. I ran into an older man, making Medicine Wheels. I greeted him, in which he looked up, then smiled and answered me warmly. After a bit of talk, I wandered on to meet others and was in awe at how many different flags were flying. Real American flags, I thought. Oh, how so many have spilled blood in the name of peace and freedom for this country. The red stripes represent blood, I thought. In my culture, dark blue can represent things that are backward, or not right. I made my way towards a large campsite, and as I approached, I realized the people there were from Canada. I then began to scan around and see all the colors of man, black, white, yellow, and red, just like our Medicine Wheel. These people had so much more in common that one might think. If only more people would stop putting the wants of the few over the needs of the many. I stopped by some young adults from California who had come in support of stopping the pipeline. They were not Native, so I spoke to them and let them know that I was happy to see them here. We are all brothers and sisters under one Creator, I thought, as I smiled to them. I then heard someone singing a Native song not too far away. One of the Californian companions expressed how beautiful the songs here sound. I nodded in agreement and asked if they sang a lot here. Thousands have joined the Standing Rock Sioux and other Native Americans in opposing the construction of the pipeline. I walked to where I heard the singing and found some horses were there. The horses just looked up while they were eating and came a bit closer. I said hello. I remember riding horses and breaking them as a young boy. Sand kicked up, mane swaying, hair swaying behind, foot and hoof digging in the sand, and the beating of two hearts, as they both cross the finish line, with the fast walking man ahead. Stories told to me in my youth still wander in my memories. I turned, thinking how nice this place looks, the clouds, the sky, our standing brothers and sisters, the trees. I began walking towards the main area, where the speaker was. I looked at the cook shack, with women working on food. It smelled great. As I inhaled the smell of cooking food, my face turned, smelling the aromas. Then I spotted a Veteran from Michigan I knew. Another two Veterans came closer, as we began telling short war stories, and making fun each other. Then laughter. We are the only people required to have pedigrees. We laughed. We all agreed. We may be from different tribes, but we are all still related. Time has a strange way of making people forget that very important point. They said that they had left. Many were here having ceremonies and prayers, but later left. They said the pipes are brought out each morning to pray, though. I told them of the land I had seen where they had already gone through and the land lay upturned. They said, yes, the black snake is going through the land. They mentioned that this land was once where Natives camped long ago. This is where ancestors were buried, along that whole ridge, pointing up above the river, then across this whole area. I remembered a teaching I learned as a young boy. Artifacts should never be taken out of a burial site, unless the land falls apart on its own, like next to a river. Then one person said, long ago, after people were dying from blankets given to them with sickness on it, many were buried here. I remembered the tall heaps of buffalo skulls so high like a pyramid, after Gen. Philip H. Sheridan ordered Maj. All Veterans were called to a meeting, in which we walked into an older military tent. All the Veterans gathered in a circle; then the oldest one said a prayer and we began introducing ourselves to the others. We were told the history of how this camp came to be, as the leader had been there from the start. He said that every morning the Veterans and pipe carriers bring their pipes to the gathering place outside, with smudging of sage to smoking and prayer. Yet, security people said they had pipe bombs, and were lighting the fuses. I remembered a teaching I learned as a young boy. Artifacts should never be taken out of a burial site...It's so disrespectful that people would do this to our ancestors. He went on and told of and elderly woman who was approached while she was guarding a gravesite, and thrown to the ground, as the security said she was interfering. When things like this happen to those who have harmed her and their families, karma will likely not even come to their minds. He told us how the security dogs were. A young girl had been bitten in the face by a security dog. She had just returned from the doctor that evening and was speaking. It was explained that as the security sprayed people with pepper spray, the wind picked up and blew it back at the security and dogs, making the dogs bite their masters. The Creator and Mother Earth are helping, I thought. He then told us of long ago when people were given blankets with sickness on them; people here got sick, and this spot is where many were brought. There are ancestors buried all along the hills and around this area. Long ago, a tribal man had asked a person to document this, as one day, it would be needed. A local person has that record, and we are prepared to show it. Probably thrown back into the ground with the pipeline, we guess. This reminded me of colonial-era germ warfare. To think that Hitler learned his tactics from early colonial European-Americans' tactics against Native Americans. Our people watched as the pipeline people put poison in and around the holes of the prairie dogs. There is an area of trees near, where the eagles come each year. Those prairie dogs are part of their natural food source, and we found many eagles that were very ill after eating the poisoned prairie dogs. We gathered them up and found a veterinarian who could help them. Some were held at a zoo till they were better, and we released them the other day. Now, we are seeing the local buffalo over there grazing. This is our national bird being poisoned by Americans. We Natives consider them sacred. But even these other relatives are our sacred relatives, as all life is sacred. The politicians have never taken our concerns seriously, and it is the same today. Our ancestors have died protecting this country, and if needed, we will do the same. I recalled the horrible smell. This reminds me of a paradox that has come to mind lately. As we left the tent, we walked out to people dancing, much like a pow-wow. A group from Washington state was singing, while people were dancing, yet many were not dressed in their fancy regalia. Just then a Veteran brother came up and said how he loved the feeling he had experienced since he arrived. He said that he had never known how seriously the Natives took spirituality and practiced it in everything we did. He seemed to have found this inner spirit waiting to be uplifted from the darker thoughts, feelings, and emotions one may carry after being discharged from the military. In the end, we parted, and as I walked to my car, I stopped, looked up into the stars and began to pray for the people. When I was finishing, a man was standing beside me and then began to speak to me. He introduced me to an elder woman, who did not look her age. She spoke of how she grew up here, as she and her family had been there since the beginning of the protests. She said that many of the surrounding farmers came by in support of the natives here. They had said that even though they did not have the courage to stand against the pipeline, they were happy we were. They apologized at how we and our ancestors were treated and recognized that this was really our lands. They said that they would be praying for us all. This was so great to hear, as I thought about people of the past who did not share the same compassion for our people, like some did long ago. As I drove away, I still kept praying, and as I passed over the hill, looking into the mirror, I felt as if I was leaving friends and family behind. This felt so much like when I left the military and different people in my life. As I sit here ending this, I say a prayer, as I do at each night. Thanks for sharing from a native perspective.

Support organizations and individuals making a positive impact, and businesses and institutions that keep money circulating locally. And continue to build relationships with others who have access to resources and can help influence policies that benefit everyone. Most of what I said to him describes the world I live in here in Detroit. Detroit has a history as a union town and home to Black nationalist movements. White participants from New York to California told similar stories. Polls show the nearly 60 million people who voted for Trump were overwhelmingly White. Many them are relatives of White people who did not vote for Trump. More importantly, I wonder what difference still could be made. I learned of two occasions where those processes have had success. In Maine, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was set up to investigate the kidnapping of Native American children who were placed in foster care with White families. Recommendations from the commission are now being implemented. In addition, White allies of the Wabanaki tribe held a workshop to talk about how White privilege has benefited them and negatively impacted Native people.

The clinic was gifted a 3 acre parcel of land by the Standing Rock Medic Healer Council, to build the clinic and surrounding farm and garden that will allow us to fully realize the vision of the work we are manifesting. These next few months will be a time of raising more funds for the building structures. January 30, 2017 We are excited to announce that we are pursuing a partnership with Mass Design Group to design and build the Mni Wiconi Health Clinic at Standing Rock. They have been building clinics and hospitals around the world for Partners in Health and have been using architecture to make the invisible structures of violence in our society visible so that we can move with more equity and healing. We will convene back in Standing Rock in just over one month to start assessing the site and mapping out the design plan which will involve community dialogue and training to be able to employ local labor to get it done. Please help us make the vision real. It is truly the most exciting thing that I have personally participated in during the past 20 years of my work in medicine. We recognize that we cannot practice decolonized medicine without the work of decolonizing our own mentality and our ways of relating. It is an honor to serve these NAHA students and to bring forth a model of interaction that will teach and humble me throughout my years of practice as a physician. We are committed to working to birth this project in correct relationship with all the healers at the table and the community we are serving. This medicine is so powerful, because it is awakening us to our own colonial wounds and wounding through the process of serving. Water is Life. It is an honor to accompany you. We will be starting our clinical service in the upcoming month and will have several groups of health workers from UCSF out to develop our clinical work out at Standing Rock. We truly believe that the development of decolonized medicine has the potential to radically change how we think of medical care and standards of practice, moving into a more humane, balanced and encompassing vision of health. It is inspiring what we can do together, with mass support. As we move into a period of time where divisiveness may define the ethos of our national political stage, we must remember that we can work together, forge our own partnerships and work together at the community level to ensure the safety, health and dignity of all.

With the current ascension of a true Grinch president to the throne of the most powerful country in the history of countries just as the showdown over the Dakota Access Pipeline, which pit the overconsumption of fossil fuels that continues to drive the American Dream against the preservation of native ancestral lands, happening in the background, there is no better time to examine Poltergeist again than now. The horror is in our very foundation. The largest and longest continuous protest in U.S. history, Standing Rock was to me a sign that America was at last starting to deal with the ghosts in its closet. His use of horror movie language underlines just how grotesque this situation really is. The answer, if we pay attention to our native first peoples as well as our own top storytellers and myth-makers, everyone from Spielberg to Carlin to Dr. Seuss, may lie in the asphalt beneath our feet. Kunstler is right. Depression is now the leading cause of disability not just in the U.S., but across the globe, according to the World Health Organization. And its real. Not only are whole ecosystems being decimated to feed our oil addiction, but we are on the brink of launching another world war over the largest crude reserves left in the Middle East. Like Freddy Krueger on steroids we are intent on expanding our dream cum nightmare way past Elm Street to encircle the globe. The first is indigenous, the second is capitalist. At Standing Rock these same to two world views that are in conflict in the Amazon faced off right here on American soil. Like a real-life Poltergeist flick, the oil that suburban America needs to thrive needed to be transported across a real-life Native American sacred burial ground. To me, this is a sign that change is imminent. As I have argued over and over again in this column, indigenous and traditional ways of life point the way forward towards a planet free of both pollution and misery. For this to happen we are going to have to leave the fake security of our isolated homes and cars and join the Whos down in Whoville just like we did at Standing Rock. Just like they finally figured out at the end of Poltergeist, to exorcise this demon we are going to have to throw out the squawk box completely and join our brothers and sisters who are already on the front line. In the end, the only way to wake up from the nightmare is to completely face reality and reclaim the ground beneath our feet.

But it's also important to check in on public opinion, or rather media opinion, to contextualize Trump's horrific standing. Trump was also number one in 2016, which kind of says it all. SPONSORED Trump's most serious competition for most hated person alive is Martin Shkreli, who is high on most lists of people the public loathes. Shkreli, the former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, earned the ire of millions of Americans by hiking the price for the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by 5,000 percent. He was also arrested for fraud. Others who find their way onto various most-hated lists are child molester Jared Fogle, Kanye West and Kim Kardashian (both as a couple and when measured separately), O.J. Simpson, Casey Anthony, Bernie Madoff, Michael Moore, Mel Gibson, and Tiger Woods. And some of the worst dead people in history consistently show up on these kinds of lists: Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Osama bin Laden to name a few. In the end, Trump triumphs as the most despised man alive today in America, and probably the world. He has appointed a government of plutocrats, mostly mirroring his own unfitness for office, who appear determined to dismantle the institutions that have made this country humane, strong, prosperous, and respected. They cannot make America great again. Instead of accountability or transparency, ideas or innovation, you get a commander-in-chief whose most salient traits are narcissistic self-interest, hypersensitivity to criticism and a knee-jerk tendency toward abuse. His intellectual interests would not fill a safe-deposit box at Trump Tower. This is a man who likes to strut and gloat. It seeks to achieve dominance through a whirlwind of individually meaningless but cumulatively manipulative statements. To his credit, much like his racism, his xenophobia, his sexism, his narcissism, his creepy obsession with his daughter and his insecurities, 45 has not been shy about sharing his laziness with the world. And according to Uhlmann, we all need to give up on any hope that the speeches written for Trump and delivered by the man himself are any reflection of his true thoughts. His vulgarity was unstoppable and without limit. We're dealing with a man who literally thinks exercising too much is bad because your body has a finite amount of energy. Then again, maybe the rudimentary practices of government are simply beyond him. The President is served Diet Coke at lunch while his guests get only water; the President gets two scoops of vanilla ice cream, his guests one. A regular visitor to the White House told me that leaks about the President shouting at his senior staff were true. Donald Trump is the con man huckster of all time, and in his sway are the many descendants of those suckers who back in the day provided a steady livelihood for good old P.T. Barnum did it for fun and profit; Trump out of malice, a desperate need for attention and most important to the country, the desire to divert attention from the fact that in less than six months his administration has flamed out in many spectacular ways, while at the same time effectively wrought havoc with representative democracy and government.

This, so the story goes, is the longstanding tale of a yet another Middle Eastern dictator, struggling to maintain his grip on power except by means of military force, a tale of a bad man doing bad things to his own people. In this telling, the US and its allies in NATO and the EU, appear as the good guys, supporting the Syrian rebels in their various guises against the bad guys, from Assad to Putin and Iran. And the assault on eastern Ghouta, like the siege of Aleppo before it, is proof positive of this narrative, a desperately grim manifestation of the baddie-driven dynamic impelling the Syrian conflict on. As stated above, this is the persistent narrative on the Syrian conflict in the West. It is also a persistently misleading narrative. For a corrective, look no further than Afrin, both a city and region in north-eastern Syria, where an equally merciless assault on citizens has been carried out. First came the fighter planes and missiles just over six weeks ago, then the ground troops moved in. And now, the brutal triumph, with the invading fighters celebrating their victory in Afrin this weekend, turfing out their antagonists, and, with them, nearly 200,000 Afrin residents. Yet there has been no condemnation of what has just happened in Afrin. And the planes and missiles (and not a few troops) were not of Russian provenance; they were from neighbouring Turkey. They were from a member of NATO. They were from a nation regarded as a Western ally. This brutal, unforgiving assault on a Syrian city was therefore organised and carried out by a nation too close to the West for comfortable condemnation, outraged-of-Paris-and-Berlin letters, and declamations from the UN. So completely compromised is the West in the Syrian catastrophe that its leaders are now, by backing Turkey, effectively also backing the very people the US and its allies have spent the best part of three years fighting in Syria and Iraq. So, from the perspective of the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the conquest of Afrin is one in the eye for those it considers an existential threat. As well they would given the FSA is populated by those Islamist factions Kurdish fighters have been battling in their conflict with ISIS. Moreover, the fact that there was a Kurdish statue to pull down also tells us something about Afrin. This was not a city, indeed a region, taken over by the Kurds as the Syrian state lost control of its territory in 2012. Rather Afrin is a region that, since the 18th century, has been predominantly Kurdish. Far from being a simple tale of good-versus-Russia, the reality of Syria is a compromised, cynical mess in which international actors on either side are making endlessly cynical calculations as to what might, at this moment, be in their interests. And as it stands, those calculations are being made at a very steep cost to the Syrian people themselves, be they Arab or Kurdish. Tim Black is a spiked columnist. Picture by: Getty Images.

Boasberg last week ruled that the North Dakota Petroleum Council, which represents more than 500 companies, including ETP, will be allowed a say in the shutdown debate.

As America settles down to celebrate Thanksgiving, we are presented with a grim irony that the holiday which allegedly celebrates cooperation between white colonists and Native Americans is overshadowed by violence at the Dakota Access Pipeline. There are many convoluted theories and histories that have confused the truth around the first Thanksgiving, relegating it to the status of myth and legend. Back then, Americans were desperately in need of unity and inspiration. The legend of Thanksgiving becomes even less palatable when you consider the atrocities against Native American water protectors at the Dakota Access Pipeline, in Cannonball North Dakota. A young woman may lose her arm after police threw a grenade into a crowd of protestors and hundreds have been injured by water cannons fired in freezing weather, rubber bullets and tear gas. The chilling reality of the relationship between Native Americans and the U.S. government is now staring us all in the face. This is sad and horrible but also true.

Though the counts refer to incidents recounted at trial, the allegation was that Fool Bear raped the girl repeatedly for at least four years, beginning when she was 10 years old. U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland scheduled sentencing for Aug. 23. Fool Bear faces a minimum of 30 years in prison. The lead witness at trial was the young woman who testified to years of sexual abuse at the hands of Fool Bear. The lead question before the jury was whether the troubled girl could be trusted. He asked the U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI to investigate potential charges against anyone who knew of and did not report the abuse. They testified that the girl was sexually and physically abused by Fool Bear, which may have contributed to the complex post-traumatic stress disorder she suffers. Fool Bear chose not to testify on his own behalf. His attorney Carey Goetz defended him by raising doubt for the jury about the young woman's credibility. She also questioned whether expert testimony truly corroborated the girl's story. Delorme said after trial he hoped the conviction would encourage other young people on Standing Rock to report abuse. Goetz said the question of whether to appeal would not be decided until after sentencing. Fool Bear was district chairman of the 900-person town since 2005. Most recently, he was vocal about wanting the Dakota Access Pipeline protesters to move out of the area. He argued they were harming community resources, such as the gym, and preventing North Dakota from reopening Highway 1806 for months. He led meetings in January at which residents passed a resolution ordering protesters to leave. According to Title 20 of Standing Rock tribal laws, Fool Bear's seat shall be forfeited due to the conviction, and Cannon Ball will need to hold a special election within 60 days.

Just ask the two mentioned above how that worked out for them. No. It will never happen. The only way to make a real substantial change is to simply take back the country from these treasonous politicians and bankers and institute a radical change that will actually feel and look like real change. Those that say that just want to make a buck off of you, or control you. This renders those who want to up-rise as rebel-rousers; people going against the stream worthy of being put down like a rabid dog. Case in point, Jesus Christ and Martin Luther King. We must not go off like that. We must tell the population of our plan ahead of time and educate them as to why we are doing this. Okay, this is one way of doing just that. And we all must remember, the Republicrat party, both factions, are not our friends; no matter what some of them might say or do. They are all actors, much like Ronald Ray-gun. They may throw you an insignificant bone to appear as if they are listening to their constituents, but in reality, they are just playing the sovereign. All of us together can restore the government of the United States of America, placing the power back to the people and arresting the bankers, politicians and those in our legal system (police, judges and lawyers) who have been subjugating us under their fascist domain.

There is a great need to inform the millions of sleeping people living in this country about what is going to happen and why. A lot of you reading this may think that you are awake, but truly you are not. You have to wake up and realize that the crux of the matter is that capitalism has to end. There is nothing to fear. We can use the Internet, Overpass Light Brigades and even an all out media blitz. and this website. These four social media works, will tell the sheeple and people of our intent of action and when and where it will all happen. It will convert those that think they are awake, yet have no clue what true freedom is all about. If you have noticed, new page links are beginning to show up under this page. Very soon these pages will instruct the individual groups of professions and civilian people, on what, when and where to act. You have to trust me.

We will all have an active role in this liberation. The silliness that if you tell two friends and they tell two friends and they tell two friends and so on and so on, will have you informing everyone in the country within a month. Use these methods to build a movement. The first actions will be with the lawyers.

You can get a start on how our fights will look here. Your plans for the takeover will be placed on this page here. There will be a Bastille Day. The plan would be to gather thousands of people to the county jails and state prisons in every state of this country. We would like to see this take place by October 21st, 2016. If it takes two weeks to accomplish that will give us enough time before part two of the plan gets implemented. Well, that is not as easy an answer as it used to be. We take the state and national capitals, the White House, Supreme Court and all D.C. government agencies and arrest all the politicians and congress confirmed secretaries. The Bastille Day alone will release over one million people. The media blitz will have all information about the Bastille Day and a Million Mask March, to be held across the country on November 5th, 2014. The only problem with this date is that congress will not be in session and on recess that day. And the prisoners may not be released by then. Well, number one, it was written a couple of years ago and many things have changed since then. I can now see a way that we can do this revolution and not even have to show up for it. But it would take the will off the majority of registered voters to do it. Somewhere in the neighborhood of 45 million votes to stay at home. Otherwise, about 5 million can take the country over with the old plan that used to be here but has moved for now. I do not want this country to fall back into the republicrats control in 2016. Therefore, I have devised a plan that will give us (especially me) some time to work on it and inform the people as to it. Our stand will officially begin on Tuesday, July 5, 2016, and be over with by Saturday, November 12th, 2016. The plan will actually be better then what you are about to read. I had all the dates for this action with the first Tuesday as election day, not the second one. So, this plan is going to be much better then below. I have gone over this site and changed the dates. This is gonna be great. First the lawyers will defect. Months later the police defect and months after that, those working inside the government will defect, one week before the general election on November 1, 2016. On election day, Tuesday, November 8, 2016, we all will write me in for president, thus leaving the republicrates standing all alone. The plans for up to this day will blow your minds away. The plans for these days and those leading up to and following the Takeover, will be exposed as we come nearer to it. For now though, it could go either way: either we take it back by write in candidate, or we take it back by amassing millions of people in D.C. and other capitals. If we win through election, the moment I am sworn in I will declare marshal law and begin to make right what these corrupt men and woman made wrong for us, just for a buck. For this we will need our military. Those locked up will be dealt with according to reputation. Folks like Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich (who is currently not in office, but will be arrested along with the former lawmakers), Elizibeth Warren and Joe Biden, will be dealt with first, while those like Daryl Issa, Mitch McConnal, Eric Cantor, Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reed and John Boehner will be dealt with last. And Kent State happened 40 years ago before we had the Internet and live streaming. I have no doubt that the military has our back. And we will have former military get with Occupy Marines. I am just not too sure the police will have the same attitude and that is why we will have former police officers get with the Occupy Police to talk to these people before we make our move. They will in essence take out those officers or military trying to take out us. These are our fathers, our mothers, our brothers and sisters, our aunts and uncles, our cousins and friends. Maybe five million will be enough. That is less then 2 percent of the country. Of course, a general strike with millions of people going on strike the week of the 5th of November, will help out a lot as well. That is why we will need union leaders in this struggle as well. They (the government) will not do anything because this is how we approach; First and foremost we approach with love as seen here in this video from the fist Occupy National Gathering held in Philadelphia on July 4th of last year. And it will be lead by the women and children. That is how we attack and do it unarmed; one: the women and babies followed by the children first, two: the teens, three: the elderly, four: the sick and handicap, five: the able bodied men, and last: the vets for peace who may or may not be armed. This is a trick I learned from Gene Sharp. Now, in either scenario, either a takeover from write-in, or a psychical takeover trough walk-in, the elected officials will all be arrested and sorted out at a later date. That is why we have to inform the sheeple of our plans and our solutions to the problems and the outcomes we expect. The most important of witch will be their financial (economic) situations and how this will effect them. This we do prior to the action with the social media. You can all view the new economic plan here, as soon as I get the rest finished first. There are about 400 billionaires and over 7 million millionaires in this country that will not like the fact that things are about to change. The only thing that makes a millionaire think he is better than the over 300 million other people, who are not, is the fact that he has all that money. They find it appalling that their tax dollars go to feed the hungry, heal the sick or house the poor. To them, those people are just lazy, but those people, along with the unions, people of color, kids under the age of 25, etc., are our army and we must get it through to them. I have come up with a plan to replace this game of monopoly we play; capitalism must go. What we will replace it with is something that has never been tried before. This will be a temporary fix until we can educate the masses on a resource based economy. My plan for this is so simple that I feel that a few economists can have the new rules down in a week. Basically, it is a type of Marxism meets Capitalism meets fairness. In short, Reaganomics. Now, the next words which will appear below in white, were written and published during August of 2013, when we still had time. Now, it is too late. What it will now have to come down to is basically us, the U.S., defaulting on the money. We could still pay off the foreign creditors, but the guarantee that the FED will not end anytime soon is over. So, the world will just have to eat it. Again, the next words you read will have to be integrated into the reality on the ground at that given moment. The one hundred-year lease on the Fed and the federal reserve note (FRN) ends on December 23rd, 2013. This is how we end the Fed. We simply make our move before they can renew the lease and it will expire on that date. The first thing we do is an inspection of Fort Knox and implement student debt forgiveness. We also freeze all the bank accounts of anyone with over 250 thousand dollars in cash, leaving them with that amount until the end of the FRN. At that time the money (FRN) will be worthless no matter where it is. All those with their accounts frozen will have to pay off their own personal debts. The excess will be used to pay off the national debt. This money will be used to pay off the countries and foreign nationals expecting FRNs. This way, no one has an excuse to attack us. All this has to be concluded by December 23rd of this year. We take what is left and pay off the debts of the Americans who owe foreign banks first, then the U.S. banks. Credit cards, auto and home loans, personal loans, this will all be paid off; so in essence it will be like everyone is getting a debt pass. A revolution to change the government and those in it is not sufficient enough to liberate us. Our work must be quick. From the time of takeover until December 23rd, the new system must be built. All adults will personally go to one of these banks and sign up for a national debit card or whatever it is we have that would work much better than that. Each card will carry all information of the cardholder and their purchases. This will be for every adult. If two thirds of this country are adults, that would be roughly 20 trillion dollars between them. At moment I believe there is something like 1.2 trillion FRNs in circulation. Each person, who has obtained the age of 18 after December 23rd and upon having a High School diploma, will also be issued the same amount as we play this new game out. Also those serving time for crimes against the citizens of the planet will also be eligible for this pay-out once out of lockup and the system. No longer will society either look up in awe, or down in pity, at people just because of the size of their bank account. No longer will either class feel they are entitled to something just for being in a particular position in life because both will cease to be. No need for Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous, it will now just have to be Lifestyles of the Smart and Famous. Everyone will get what he or she needs to thrive. Society will be divided into two classes: working and non-working. Each class will have a guaranteed income regardless. Those who want to work will get a job, if even planting flowers in their towns. No one, who wants a job, will be without a job. Now the next numbers I am just throwing out there, but it would be something like this: whatever the working class gets the non-working class will get half that amount. Or better yet, the working class can have an income starting at 60 grand, with a maximum salary of 75 grand per year. We have so many unemployed people in this country that there is no need for everyone to work, or for anyone to work, a 40-hour workweek. If you are someone who does hard work, you can go to a 20 or 10 hour workweek and share the work with others. Actually, the harder the work the less hours you be required to work, while the easier the work the more hours you will work. And that will be with all work, both mental and psychical. This amount will all be tax-free. Property taxes will also end for private individuals. The IRS for personal income tax will be abolished. Health care will be free. Doctors will also get the working class wage. School will be free for them, so the doctor who is really a businessman in disguise, who only became a doctor just to become a millionaire, will no longer exist and only those who truly became a doctor to help people will prevail. The amounts above, again, are tax-free. Only now, there will be certain things you will no longer have to pay for. Health care will be free. Schooling will be free. Electricity will be free through the use of the Tesla coil. Cars will be converted and now built to use it. Oil will no longer be used to manufacture gasoline or home heating oil. The price of oil will bottom out. There are other inventions for internal combustion engines that run on compressed air, hydrogyn or water. These can also be used to convert the oil burning furnaces. The only ones paying taxes will be businesses and the consumption tax at points of sale. Corporations, as well as personal property tax, will be a thing of the past. All the stockholders of those companies will now enter into a collective and have to take personal liability. In fact, everyone will have to take personal liability. No more hiding behind a badge or piece of stock paper, or a governmental agency. And this is where it gets fun. As you make a purchase, your debit card is swiped. All the information as to your personal bank account and what you purchased will be on that card. Likewise, all the people purchasing items from individual business will have their purchases recorded with that business. So, at the end of each year, after the accounting has been done and the businesses have paid their taxes, the profit will be returned to the customers of that business in proportion to the price of the items purchased. In essence, everyone will be paying cost plus a small percentage (to be figured out later) for the goods and services they purchase. The small percentages will go to the owner(s) of the companies. There has been a media blitz to make everyone believe that this is New World order stuff and in a way it is. This is a New World order of peace and love I propose to all. Hopefully the rest of the world will jump on board with us. By ending the FED we will put the FRN out of circulation; this means that those who have FRNs gained through illegal activities or conquest, like the billions missing in Iraq, will have worthless pieces of paper. Only American citizens will be eligible for the 100,000 NAD payout. Any legal foreign nationals working in this country will be given the same amount as the working class. With no cash and no one being able to really get rich enough to influence politicians, things will purr right along. We will make rules for foreign nationals later. The economist can figure out how we deal with foreign countries and weather or not we even have to. And we must not forget that it is just a game and not to take it so seriously. The police will be taken off the street and the military will be placed there temporally. This is not martial law. We will place someone like Judge Andrew P. Napolitano as Attorney General. This will be done by our defectors and victims. Those that have been found to be corrupt or to have violated the rights of the citizens will be held for trial. Those who have been straight up with the citizens will return to the streets. Statutory crimes will no longer be enforced and all future lawmakers will begin to repeal statutory laws once created. Those military people asked to take over the temporary law enforcement of the streets will ignore everyone not hurting anyone. Those that have succumbed to the police brutality and corruption will get help from all the lawyers who used to be members of the American Bar Association. Things are gonna change. Education will be overhauled as well. K through 12 will no longer be where the job of the educator is to get the student to read enough and know just enough addition and subtraction so that the graduate can fill out a tax return. Most of the teachers will be taken from the anthropologists, scientists, historians, mathematicians and artist of the world. Even the now unemployed lawyers (if not in jail) will have something to teach. And secondary public schools will be free. Teachers will be reviewed every year to make sure only the dedicated remain employed. Just about every license forced upon the people will end charging fees. Those for businesses will continue to charge fees for doing business in this country. This is a practice of tyranny on the people. Once you have demonstrated that you know how to drive and the rules of road, you will be issued a license that states that. Or better yet, it gets added to your debit card. Not only that, but personal driving will no longer be suspended or revoked for any reason whatsoever. This will all be funded by the p.o.p. (point of purchase) taxes collected for the automotive category. So you ad say a 20 percent pop price to a set of tires you just bought and that money goes into the transportation department. Now, all the different Offices, Commissions, Bureaus, Agencies and Departments will be reviewed for usefulness. Those deemed to be harmful will be terminated. Those that have purpose will remain. And we will make a whole new number of departments. Like the Department of Employment, or the Department of Fun. The final goal of our new system will be to rid us of a representative government and head towards an anarchistic society with direct democracy and a resorced based economy. The entire planet will have to be on board for that. I am sure once the other countries see what is going on in this country they will want to follow suit. This will all be secured through the education system we set up and may not come into existence for some ten to thirty or forty years. It truly will take this long. We have very old people who have been heavely programed by a captalist oligarchy. I never said this would be a walk in the park; there will be some setbacks. But they will be minor and we will find the solutions. I hope you all will join us in this most radical and humane endeavor. There is one other real thing I would like to mention here. I want you to know that this plan is really contingent on whether or not you all can really wake up and realize that your country has been a deceiver to the world. You must grow up. You have to realize that all those that have lead in the past, have been, or still are, as corrupt as the night is long. Even Jimmy holds some of the blame, but not much. So you all have to realize that many of what you thought were great things done in this country were really done for sinister reasons that you are just now finding out about. You were fooled. If you were born after 1945, click here for a message to humanity. He may have said he is ashamed to be an American, but he never said he is ashamed to be a human being.

Learn what's trending across POPSUGAR. Sara Jumping Eagle is a pediatrician, a mother of three, a member of the Great Sioux Nation, and an activist to be reckoned with. On Feb. 27, Donald Trump and the Army Corps of Engineers were slapped with an emergency lawsuit over the contentious North Dakota Access Pipeline, and Jumping Eagle is its lead plaintiff. In late January, Trump issued an executive order to expedite the pipeline, following a hard-won victory by protesters to stop the construction late last year. But Jumping Eagle continues to fight. She is one of more than a dozen Oceti Sakowin, or Great Sioux Nation, tribe members behind this latest legal action, which demands an immediate halt to construction on the pipeline. Jumping Eagle's lead counsel, Bruce Afran, says the lawsuit is two-pronged. The White House has not responded to POPSUGAR's request for comment on the suit. We spoke with Jumping Eagle about why she's persevering, what she wishes more people understood about the threat the Dakota Access Pipeline poses to the Standing Rock Reservation, and her message for Donald Trump. POPSUGAR: Give us the nuts and bolts of this latest legal action. Sara Jumping Eagle: We are pointing out the fact that the United States government and the Army Corps of Engineers are violating the public interest of protecting our communities, which are already at risk. We have huge health disparities. We live in a county that's one of the poorest counties in the nation. If they were going to run a pipeline through Bethlehem or through the Arlington Cemetery, I think people would have a lot to say about that. PS: This filing takes the president directly to task. SJE: The main message would be that our communities have suffered enough. We've borne the brunt of corporate profits for generations now. We've contributed to America. We've given up lands, and part of those negotiations were for our treaty territories. And now, once again, the United States is going to violate those laws, and then label water protectors as being illegal. It's basically a choice of which laws they feel are more important in that moment in time to get what they want, which is to profit off the backs of our communities. SJE: There are so many facets to this case. SJE: This area is a very sacred place. There are generations of people who have held ceremonies there. There are tribal stories passed down generations about the specific place where the Cannonball River and Missouri River meet. Because of the movement of the waters, it causes development of sacred stones in and along the river, and those were used for ceremonies. There are many rock formations that are thought to be grave sites and places of prayer also. That is exactly where they're building this pipeline. If they were going to run a pipeline through Bethlehem or through the Arlington Cemetery, I think people would have a lot to say about that. PS: Key to your argument is the environmental threat posed by a pipeline project of this scale. That still hasn't been cleaned up. We know there was a pipeline buried under the Yellowstone River, and the river shifted, and that led to erosion that exposed the pipeline, and that led to a break in the pipeline. They're dependent on pressure changes that can take up to 15 minutes to get the information to the company, which is based in another state, to then shut it off. By then, there would be thousands of gallons leaked into the Missouri River, which does serve 18 to 20 million people downstream. It would affect generations afterwards; it's just difficult to reconcile. PS: Women have really been the driving force behind this movement. We attended public hearings, and basically the company came to the tribal administration office and just said what their plans were and showed the community the map, and that was in 2014. People told not only of the sacred sites in this area, but also the historic sites. Women have voiced opinions. So it's really an important place for her and her family to protect. PS: This has been such an effort on behalf of your tribe, at great personal cost, and with several setbacks so far. SJE: Because we know what will happen if there is a spill. We're looking at our children's faces. There are places around here where we collect sacred food and plants, and all of that is dependent on the water, so we know how important the water is to this community. We're fighting for our children's future. SJE: Calling your senator, congresspeople, the Army Corps, the Martin County Police, and North Dakota governor to voice opposition to not only the pipeline, but also the injustices that have taken place against free speech, the constitutional right to assemble, and multiple civil rights.

The area is in a flood plain and must be clear of buildings and people who have been camping to protest the nearby Dakota Access Pipeline, according to state and federal officials. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Maj. French Pope toured the Oceti Sakowin main protest camp Tuesday to assess the situation and determine what additional resources will be needed to complete the cleanup, started by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, camp residents and volunteers on Jan. 31. The camp is on corps land and remains occupied by 300 to 400 people in yurts, teepees, fortified tents and other structures. Much of the camp area has been cleared out, with thousands of tons of material hauled to the landfill in the past two weeks. The weather service and the U.S. Geological Survey will install a new stream gauge on the Cannonball River near the camp Wednesday to closely monitor river heights in the area.

For months, we have been informed only about the most dramatic developments, but I discovered after a visit to the Sacred Stone camp two weeks ago that public understanding of what this movement is all about is based on misrepresentations. As I prepared to make the trip, I read articles about the risks. And I fell for it. We had gone to North Dakota to learn how GreenLatinos might be able to help the tribe, yet at first I concentrated on myself. But all that anxiety quickly evaporated when I reached the camps. I saw that this assembly of indigenous tribes and supporters is among the most serene and peaceful groups of people I have been around. They are not unified by indignity. What unifies the thousands of water protectors who are bracing for the incoming winter is devotion and prayer. And, they told us, they expect the behavior of their brothers and sisters to reflect that. Even when we were talking about politics, the sacredness of it all was what tribe members conveyed as important. The respect of the people overcame any thought of animosity, and the solemnity of the place and the need to protect nature inspired peaceful unity. This indigenous vision of sacred air, sacred water and sacred land was striking to me. I live in Washington, D.C., where polarized rhetoric dominates the landscape, and where, since the presidential election season, distasteful attacks are rampant. Visiting the camps and understanding the spirituality driving this struggle against corporate profit was an eye-opening and humbling experience. Water protectors are constantly looking after one another, helping one another. They may not have a lot, but they are willing to give everything. I learned that not just by seeing how they would offer sweaters or blankets as temperatures dropped into the 20s, but also by listening to their stories. One woman, who is now one of many who prepare meals for the camp for free, told me how she arrived with little besides her eagerness to help cook. I have not seen a single news report that elevates this type of story. Still, peace is what this historic indigenous gathering is all about. At a time when we know that fake news stories are rampant, I encourage everyone to verify the authenticity of the news they read. This movement of solidarity is filled with people who, when asked about what they need, say they need us to pray for them. Read more.

You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. The standoff to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a fever pitch, and this may be our last chance to halt construction before Donald Trump takes office. Militarized law enforcement and private security firms are harassing, assaulting and jailing hundreds of non-violent protesters who are fighting for indigenous rights and to curb climate change. They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do.

And tears. The decision to halt work on the Dakota Access pipeline may be the victory that the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and thousands of water protectors were looking for. On the heels of the announcement, Energy Transfer Partners issued a statement insisting that they will go ahead with the project. What that means is not yet clear, but whatever happens the events at Standing Rock have been transformative, and these victories are not ones that Energy Transfer Partners or even President-elect Trump can take away. Here are just a few things that have shifted in our world because of the extraordinary Native-led uprising at Standing Rock. Veterans at Standing Rock, led by Wesley Clark Jr., spoke of the many ways the U.S. military had brutalized Native people, through killings, through taking their lands and even their children. And then they knelt down and apologized in front of the elders. These nonviolent warriors, sworn to uphold the Constitution, came to North Dakota to protect the water protectors, but they did something even more important by acknowledging historic harms and showing remorse. Clergy too came with humility and apologies. At a gathering in early November, one Christian denomination after the next burned the Doctrine of Discovery, a centuries-old religious doctrine that made its way into law and condones taking the lands of non-Christians. If it is possible to heal from the long U.S. history of genocide, these moves by clergy and veterans were powerful steps in that direction. The work of decolonizing is much bigger though, and it is Native-led. Within the camps, Lakota culture is at the foundation of everything, from the early morning prayers at the sacred fire to the food line, where elders are served first. Newcomers are reminded to respect these ways. Native people have led this movement from the beginning, and they are reclaiming their power. This time, non-Natives in large numbers stood with them and learned from them ways to live that are inclusive and collective. And as people return home from the camp, the effects will ripple out into communities across North America for years to come. Respect for Mother Earth and our own bodies Walk to the edge of the Cannonball River at Standing Rock, or to the banks of the Missouri River, which provides water to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and Cheyenne River tribes, and to millions of others farther downstream. And then consider what it would mean if DAPL ruptured, spewing toxins into this precious shared water. Yet the implications are radical. Even more radical is the idea that we would sacrifice the comforts of fossil fuel-based consumerism for the quality of that water, giving a gift of well-being to our children and future generations. Water is important everywhere, but the Sioux people, by protecting the water of their place on Earth, have shown what moral authority looks like. Their commitment attracted support from around the world, and showed people everywhere what it means to protect your home. Many are closing accounts with big banks and moving their funds into credit unions and community banks, thus helping to rebuild the economy to support communities and life. And at Standing Rock, people found many ways to exert power. In the face of pepper spray, rubber bullets, dogs, concussion grenades, and water cannons, the water protectors remained nonviolent. They were arrested by the hundreds, strip-searched, and placed in fenced enclosures resembling dog kennels. But their responses were prayerful and sometimes even loving. This display of courage moved the hearts of millions. As law enforcement escalated the violence, water protectors increased their presence. People power in all these forms works. Thousands came to the remote plains of North Dakota. Hundreds of thousands took action through donations and demonstrations. The sense of power and hope that goes with this decentralized movement, and the accumulating know-how, will make the next action easier to pull off, and the next one after that. The work, prayers, hardship, and collaborations are not over. There may be new rounds at Standing Rock, and more water protectors may be injured and traumatized there or at other locations. There may even be loss of life. And there are other pipelines that need to be confronted by water protectors. Just last week, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau gave the green light to the Kinder Morgan pipeline, and the presidency of Donald Trump could threaten everything we hold dear. Nonetheless, this is a time to celebrate. We all drink water and need a stable climate. As we navigate what may be the most dangerous time in human history, the lessons from Standing Rock can guide us. As we create a post-fossil fuel society, we can take the lessons of respect and nonviolence, of valuing life over money, of learning from the indigenous peoples as cornerstones. A revolution in values and culture is rippling out across the country and the world, and it started at Standing Rock. Licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 License.

Judge James Boasberg last summer ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to further study the pipeline's impact on tribal interests. The tribes say they're being left out of the process. The route of the pipeline would pass under the Missouri River, which flows into Lake Oahe - the lake is the primary water source for more than 10,000 Sioux, and they are concerned the pipeline could potentially affect that.

Diane Moody wants the Employment Court to declare her son Shane Chamberlain isn't capable of employing her. She said she was reluctant to go to court, but she had no choice because it was the only way to change the system so that she and other families caring for their adult disabled children could be paid fairly. Diane Moody, 76, cares for her profoundly intellectually disabled son in their home, and she's paid for 21 hours a week at the minimum wage through the Ministry of Health's Funded Family Care scheme. Under that arrangement her 51-year-old son, who has the mental age of a two-year-old, is deemed to be her employer. To illustrate her son's lack of comprehension, she said when she raised the prospect of a court case, he asked her what was for dinner. Shane's advocate, Jane Carrigan said the lack of action since the Court of Appeal case had forced their hand. And nothing in all of our dialogue with the Crown and the Ministry has given us any confidence that anything is going to change. The Employment Court action doesn't yet name the Ministry of Health as a party, but Ms Carrigan said that would probably happen when the case began. She said if the ministry was found to be the employer there would be ramifications as family carers were currently paid the minimum wage, rather than the equal pay rate. Mrs Moody first took the case to the Employment Relations Authority, which has referred it up to the Employment Court for a decision. The Authority said the case had implications for the 354 families who were currently receiving funded family care, as well as the other funding arrangements the ministry had for people caring for the severely disabled. It suggested trade unions might want to be involved in the case on the wider policy and employment issues. PSA assistant secretary Kerry Davies said the disabled person who was supposedly the employer had no control over the pay rates, hours or conditions, which were set by the Ministry of Health. Mrs Moody said she would like to see the Health Minister David Clark get involved directly. He's very welcome to come to my home. He's not likely to because he never replies to anybody. A date is yet to be set for the hearing. Diane Moody, 76, cares for her son Shane Chamberlain full-time.

Climate change is not a hoax, and making sure your grandchildren have a habitable world to live in is far more important than increasing the profits of your friends in the oil business. Thankfully, we live in a nation founded on freedoms. The First Amendment of the Constitution allows for and prioritizes the need for dissent. It protects even the abhorrent expressions of white nationalist fervor you failed to adequately condemn in Charlottesville. And it certainly protects the rights of people to vocally oppose dangerous fossil fuel infrastructure. Now, however, on your watch, those freedoms are disappearing. In 20 states, legislators have passed or are considering 30 different laws that, in one way or another, curtail our freedoms to assemble and speak freely. We remember Blackwater from Iraq. Private military contractors helped give us Abu Ghraib. Our use of them violates the 1989 United Nations Mercenary Convention. They should have no place anywhere, and certainly not on our home soil.
