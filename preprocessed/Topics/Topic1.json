The Army Corps of Engineers declined to grant the permit needed to finish the Dakota Access Pipeline earlier this month, but the decision has left many activists unconvinced the fight is over. Young Peoples Action Coalition, which was co-founded by Northfield local Cliff Martin in an effort to organize high school students around various causes, presented its case at Northfield High School Tuesday and took a group of students through what they called dangers of pipelines. The tribe argues it was not adequately consulted in the historical surveying process. Chase Ingraham, a ninth-grader at Arcadia Charter School, told the group about the militarization of police forces he saw during his three trips to Standing Rock. After helping set up one camp, he told the group of how he gained respect and admiration for the conditions Native Americans lived in, enduring years of maltreatment by the federal government. Some who attended had not heard the details of the controversy surrounding the pipeline, like 10th-grader Diana Montero. Martin ended the presentation with ways they could help, though traveling to to Standing Rock was not one of them due to current temperatures and potentially being a burden to those there. Wells Fargo and Bank of America are two of the banks investing in the pipeline and are now facing added scrutiny. The coalition also has connections with Arcadia Charter School and more than 10 other high schools around the Twin Cities metro, made while attending protests. Martin said that organizers tend not to invest in high school students, perhaps assuming apathy. The group at NHS, which might join with other high school students, is planning to drop banners in some of the banks investing in the pipeline in the next couple days while the coalition continues to keep the conversation going.

That this was one of his very first acts as president of the United States is no coincidence. Donald Trump and his team recognize the symbolic significance at stake in Standing Rock. This photo essay is a call for us all to understand why the resistance to the pipeline in Standing Rock is more crucial than ever. It is bigger than one site or one community because its here where the ideologies being aggressively pushed by Republican leaders clearly converge. Energy Transfer Partners, the corporation behind the pipeline, suggests the project will lead to greater economic development and increased efficiency compared to the railroads that currently transport the crude oil. As the protests swelled, water protectors were attacked by heavily armed police from Morton County. Yet, as the repression grew, the people stood resilient and the symbolic power of the struggle continued to grow. At this point we felt we had to go. We needed to support this movement and work to spread its message and report on what was happening on the ground. We were told by friends and fellow supporters to drive up through the south as opposed to the main road through Bismarck. Instead, we went in through Aberdeen, a couple of miles south of the camp. Hundreds of flags representing nations and movements adorned the makeshift road that led us in. We arrived at the beautiful, bitterly cold reservation only days before the announced eviction date. Beyond the Sioux nation and numerous other tribes represented at the camp, supporters continued to pour in from every corner of the country, and the world. We immediately heard the helicopters circling the camp throughout the day, in attempts to intimidate the protestors. The Indigenous Environmental Network handled the film permits. In trying to assure that our time there was as productive as possible, we had been communicating with them about coming to produce a piece. Clearly, we were not the only ones. The Sioux opened each day with prayer and while everyone in the camp was invited, absolutely no cameras were allowed. The kitchens served free meals to anyone who needed it. Folks were busy securing tents and windshields. Organizers kept track and registered newcomers. We spent our days filming, helping out in whatever way we could, and trying to stay warm. The conditions were already harsh when we arrived and it only got colder. Yet, people kept arriving. At least one thousand veterans arrived the day after we did (we heard that in total there were well over two thousand veterans in Standing Rock), committed to supporting and shielding the water protectors. As we reflected on what moved them to make the trip in the first place, it became clear that, like us, they were moved by a formidable sense of justice, an unshakable feeling that we were standing on the right side of history. In 2010, a single pipeline spill poured one million gallons of toxic bitumen crude oil into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. And in January of 2015, more than 50,000 gallons of Bakken crude oil spilled into the Yellowstone River in Montana. It was the second such spill in that area since 2011. When Michigan Governor Snyder took office in 2011, he rapidly pushed a multi-billion dollar tax break for corporations through the Republican legislature. Less tax revenues, translated into cutting costs in pensions, education, and infrastructure. He invoked executive privilege to take over cities by replacing the elected mayors and city councils with his own appointees. Cut services to save money. A largely black and brown community now faces the disproportionate effects of systemic neglect. Few question that the crisis would have been handled differently if it happened in a white suburb outside of Detroit. We were not the first to discern the clear parallels between what is happening at Standing Rock and Flint, Michigan. The mobilization of thousands of veterans from the armed forces speaks volumes. Their declaration as protectors against enemies foreign and domestic reflects a clear indignation with a system many of them have risked their lives to protect, but which now seems to serve the interests of a select group. And as the day of the eviction approached it was these veterans who offered to serve as human shields for the protectors back in Standing Rock. We felt the tension and unease. Then, unexpectedly, the Obama Administration intervened and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers legally blocked the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, denying it the required easement to drill beneath the Missouri River. There were tears of joy and sighs of relief, but the native leaders knew that this was only the beginning. And, of course, they were right. Today, Donald Trump signed executive actions to advance approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines. But just as Standing Rock has come to symbolize a greater struggle, so has the Trump presidency come to symbolize something much greater. On the one hand, a Trump presidency signifies an emboldened resurgence of the more outright champions of white supremacist ideology, which has given rise to an increase in racist attacks, and could result in virulent anti-immigrant, xenophobic legislation as well as a critical backtrack to the gains of the civil rights movement and the rights of Indigenous Nations. On the other hand, the Trump presidency appears set to secure, cement and bulletproof the continued privilege and dominance of the super-wealthy minority. One look at his cabinet and this becomes painfully clear. Standing Rock stands out to us because it confronts the ideologies so clearly represented by Trump and his cronies: white supremacy and wealth domination. And although folks will cringe at hearing this, these two ideologies lie deep within the building blocks of this country. Sadly, it takes the Standing Rocks, the Flints, and Fergusons of the country to unveil them. It is clear that the Trump administration will continue to support the DAPL while investors wait to see how long it takes him to reverse the decision. The Sioux hope that the battle over the environmental impact assessment will stall the pipeline long enough that investors will pull out of the deal. If not, they have made it clear they are ready to continue fighting to protect their rights, their land, and their water. We hope the rest of us are too. At Human Pictures we thus recognize and celebrate Standing Rock as not only a catalyst of a new environmental movement that is supportive of indigenous peoples, but as a symbol of numerous ongoing struggles across the world that reject profit as the driver of history and which present different models that allow us to move forward driven by principles of justice, dignity and harmony with our planet. In our efforts, we will continue to highlight connections across these movements and shed light on the struggles where we can all gather strength in the years to come.

In April 2016 she started the Sacred Stone Camp, the first occupation to oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline. Westword sat down with her to get her perspective on the NoDAPL movement, renewable energy, and the future of life on Earth. It was not only 300 tribal nations; it was the Sami from Norway and Sweden, the Mongolians from China and Russia, Aboriginals from Australia, many African nations, aboriginals from India, the Maori from New Zealand. But as far as American history goes, this was the largest tribal gathering ever. This is the first time we stood among our enemies as allies. And then when everybody came in, when we went up to 15,000 people and you came over the hill and you saw all the teepees, the Chippewa lodges, it was overwhelming. I remember the first time I came over the hill and I saw all the people, I pulled off to the side of the road and cried because it was so like a dream. And as you drove into the camp, no matter where you went, you could hear people singing, and each in their own language. You could hear prayer ceremonies going on. You could hear hip-hop music. You could hear country-Western. Everyone who came and stood that ground became family with each other. This is their home now. Prophecy. I always talk about this woman from South Carolina. I asked. Law enforcement and private security forces used dogs, rubber bullets, beanbag rounds, percussion grenades, batons, tear gas, pepper spray and fire hoses in subzero temperatures against protesters. We scared them. It was the first time that I could imagine that our police department was no longer there to protect the people but was there to protect the corporation. They just have to remind themselves. Despite the efforts of thousands of water protectors and support from millions of people around the world, the Dakota Access Pipeline will be built. Depends on what the results are. They have done four tests; all four have sprung a leak, including this morning. We told them it was going to happen. The steel is substandard. Production of crude oil in North Dakota and in the U.S. peaked in 2014. Three-fourths have been shut down, and that is a tremendous amount of oil that is not flowing. We are not doing pipeline by pipeline. We are doing a unified front everywhere. So right now we have Sacred Stone people in Texas, Louisiana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Utah, Oregon, Washington and California. And we just met with all the groups in western Canada and eastern Canada. We entered into an alliance with Amazon tribes and then Nicaragua, El Salvador and Mexico.

This week's high-profile intervention was not the first time unarmed protesters have encountered police violence. Keene says part of the reason for the strong solidarity among Native tribes across the country is because the dispute over the the pipeline is part of a long-standing fight to have the sovereignty of their nations respected by the US government. These lands that the pipeline is cutting through right now are their homeland from time immemorial.. One advantage, however, is that Native people from the Plains are teaching the folks from warmer climates how to adapt, using lots of traditional methods from bonfires to longhouses. 6.

Now that they have arrived, Sanderson said that protestors intend to stay, worried that if they do pull up stakes in the camps that the pipeline construction companies will move right back in.

Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline.

Just minutes earlier, she and the rest of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe learned that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers won't grant an easement that would have allowed construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) to cross under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River. Her joy is tangible, her infectious laugh punctuating every sentence. Klein asks her how she feels about the news. Then, she breaks down in tears. It's a short video, just over a minute long. Now, young Native American activists are looking ahead, focused on the very future Iron Eyes mentioned. While Sunday's victory is historic and certainly cause for celebration, Indigenous people have quickly called for continued vigilance, especially from young activists on social media. She says there's been an atmosphere of celebration as well as apprehension over the past few days, especially because they don't know what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Sunday's decision was made by the Obama administration, which will transition power to an administration that supports the completion of the pipeline project. But we must remain cautious, Trump is right next in line. And many activists and water protectors say the good news won't erase the reported human rights abuses that have taken place. While Reuters reported that Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, asked those who are not Sioux to leave the area for the winter on Tuesday, water protectors aren't planning to leave anytime soon. In March, when they heard about plans to reroute the Dakota Access Pipeline away from Bismarck and through sacred land, they took action. As part of the Standing Rock Youth, a group of about 30 young people from the Standing Rock Sioux community, they decided to go online, and make their issue known. By now, it has more than 460,000 signatures, including endorsements from celebrities and influencers like Leonardo DiCaprio, Shailene Woodley, Bill McKibben and Ndaba Mandela. And those are the very people they wanted to galvanize. Native American Kids Standing Up Against Big Oil Company. READ, SIGN & SHARE our petition. On July 15, the group also organized a 2,000-mile relay race to Washington, D.C. to deliver their petition. That same day, the camp received notice that construction on the pipeline would begin. Like the young people before her, Ladonna Brave Bull Allard grabbed her iPhone, made a video and posted it to Facebook. While Native-led news outlets, such as The Last Real Indians and Indian Country Today, have covered the pipeline and its threat of sacred land since the beginning, most mainstream news outlets didn't give the story attention until August. That's when thousands of water protectors and allies assembled to physically block construction, and when the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia heard the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's lawsuit. Since then, the movement's grown exponentially. When the situation at Standing Rock became especially tense in September, as North Dakota law enforcement unleashed dogs and pepper spray on water protectors, those at Standing Rock uploaded videos to Facebook and Twitter to show the rest of the world what was happening. In October, Native American activists and allies started using Facebook Live and other videos on the social network to further broadcast standoffs with police. She witnessed, in real-time, a police officer macing her little sister in the Youth Council with a large canister for an extended period of time. And they seemed pretty shaken by that. The tool, Wise says, has allowed large numbers of people to understand what's actually happening on the ground. Later that month, thousands of allies started checking in to the Standing Rock Reservation on Facebook, in an attempt to confuse police after rumors that they were monitoring the social network to keep track of water protectors. However, local law enforcement denied this, which meant the effort, while well-intentioned, didn't achieve what allies hoped. Dallas Goldtooth (Mdewakanton Dakota and Dine), an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, told Mashable in October that he felt the Facebook check-ins actually helped generate support. Beyond media attention, the impact of these social media campaigns is felt within Indigenous communities, too. Wise says the movement has very much been about the youth reclaiming their own power, especially since many elders may not live to see the true impact of their decisions. But it's also about showing the incredible solidarity across various Indigenous communities that have converged on Standing Rock, and the powerful moments they share. The wide sentiment among activists is that it's a temporary victory, especially as a Trump administration looms. That includes further honing their social media skills. Wise says one thing Indigenous youth and other water protectors have learned is to make hard copies of everything they post online. They've encountered instances in which Facebook has removed posts, or technical issues randomly shorten or delete posts. They're also learning how best to navigate Facebook's algorithm, working to make sure people can see what's happening in real-time and remain educated. The fight is NOT OVER. Let's kill the Black Snake. The Sacred Stone Camp released a series of 10 questions water protectors encourage everyone to ask in the coming days and weeks, including when the Army Corps will conduct an Environmental Impact Statement, and to what extent will there be tribal input.

For now, water protectors at Standing Rock are standing firm, showing no signs of going anywhere and making sure their allies know the fight isn't over. I don't know. And that uncertainty is terrifying. But she also feels that the water protectors' prayers have gotten stronger. For the foreseeable future, they still will. youth used social media savvy to start the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline.

He said it's not clear how long land reclamation will take. Some 200,000 litres of oil has spilled near Stoughton, Sask., the provincial government said Monday. The site was described as a low-lying area with a frozen slough. The spill involved 200 cubic metres of oil, or about 1,260 barrels of oil. Any compensation would have to be discussed between the federal government, the company operating the pipeline and the band.

PBS host William Brangham began by asking about concerns that pipeline leaks could contaminate the Sioux's water supply. The CEO kept returning to the supposedly leak-proof quality of the pipe he was using. When Brangham pointed out that DAPL was originally planned to go through the capital city of Bismarck, North Dakota, but was rerouted because of citizens' concern of possible leaks damaging the water supply, Warren blamed the decision--a clear case of environmental racism--on the Army Corps of Engineers. He cited 200 oil leaks in the last six years, more than any other company, according to Reuters. But there was no concessions in Warren's response to a question about the pipeline damaging sacred tribal sites. The interview concluded with a question about what would happen once Donald Trump took office. On the November 15 national day of action, around 500 people in Austin gathered for an evening protest at the Texas State Capitol builidng. The demonstration, organized by Austin Environmental Justice, included a range of Texans committed not only to the DAPL movement, but to a fight against the ongoing onslaught against indigenous tribes and natural treasures in Texas by ETP. As speakers pointed out, the route of fracked oil will not end with the pipeline in Illinois. The oil will be loaded onto trucks and travel through multiple ETP pipelines in several states to the Texas coastal refineries, where the air will be polluted and people will be sick. Three export facilities for oil will be built on Padre Island, the last unspoiled beach in the area. Residents in Corpus Christi and other areas in coastal Texas are subject to constant boil-water alerts. After the rally at the Capitol, protesters marched through the dark streets and took over Congress Avenue, carrying banners and signs through the night streets of downtown Austin, stopping briefly at a Wells Fargo and Chase bank, both investors in ETP. Two weeks earlier, a large group protested Kelcy Warren's conflict of interest in a vote planned for November 3 at a meeting at Texas Parks and Wildlife Headquarters in Austin. No doubt stunned by the intensity of emotions expressed against him in at the meeting, Warren agreed to a meeting with Pete Hefflin of the Society of Native Nations at a later date to discuss desecration of indigenous historical, cultural, burial and sacred sites. The meeting was later cancelled because Warren would only meet in a one-on-one secretive closed-door meeting. There have also been protests against the ecological threat of more oil extraction in West Texas. The company has plans to drill 3,000 wells in the area, and pipelines will be needed. On Sunday, November 20, protestors against the ETP planned Trans-Pecos and Commanche (there they go again) Pipelines in West Texas gathered in the small artist town of Marfa, most famous for the filming of 1956 Texas epic film Giant. Under eminent domain, the lands of ranchers, farmers and Native Americans can be taken and destroyed by oil and gas interests such as ETP for short-term profit until every drop of oil and gas is extracted and unique natural areas such as Balmorhea and Big Bend have been destroyed. Lights from flares and oil rigs in the Permian Basin oil boom are already endangering the dark skies essential to research at the McDonald Observatory in the Davis Mountains of West Texas. Unless we are able to stop then, billionaires will make more billions, while areas sacred to all people will be destroyed.

Camp supporters from across North America and around the world have left messages and signatures on the walls. Since the age of 7, she has joined blockades and protests aimed at protecting her community's traditional lands from resource development. Her parents' generation was the last to live off the land; their hunting and trapping was disrupted by the thousands of oil and gas wells that have been installed there over her lifetime. Forged by that experience, Ms. Laboucan-Massimo is now working at Greenpeace and throwing herself into the campaign to stop the freshly approved Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion that will dramatically increase the amount of oil-sands crude shipped through Vancouver Harbour. Story continues below advertisement She draws inspiration from the Standing Rock Sioux pipeline battle, and from protests two years ago against Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain project when she and scores of others protested and many people were arrested. They faced threats of rubber bullets, attack dogs and water cannons in frigid weather. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will have to balance his promise to get Canadian resources to market, on the one hand, with his commitment to First Nations' reconciliation, on the other. Industry executives say their companies are desperate for access to markets in Asia as well as additional pipeline capacity to key U.S. refining centres. Alberta's NDP Premier Rachel Notley argues the pipelines are critical infrastructure needed to boost her province's economy, which has been devastated by the 30-month-long price slump. Several First Nations have launched court challenges that assert that their treaty and constitutional rights are being violated and many leaders are promising direct action aimed at blocking construction should the courts rule against them. The day after federal approval for the Trans Mountain expansion was announced, Ian Anderson, president of Kinder Morgan Canada, raised concerns about the safety of his workers in light of vows of continued opposition. There is clearly no single view among indigenous leaders on resource development. Mr. Anderson emphasized that his company has sought, and in some cases won, consent from First Nations along the route. At the Assembly of First Nations annual meeting near Ottawa this week, there was vigorous debate, with some chiefs arguing that communities should look to profit from oil and gas development in order to escape poverty. Others suggest companies mistakenly tout benefit agreements as expressions of support, when often they merely reflect the desire of the community to benefit from a project over which they have no control. Among the gathered chiefs, there was widespread opposition to resource development that threatens to create environmental damage, and the assembly passed a resolution supporting Standing Rock. Several speakers portrayed the North Dakota standoff as a signature moment for indigenous people in North America as they undergo a political renaissance and assume a leading role in the environmental movement. Mr. Bear, a student at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, visited Standing Rock in August and was impressed by the alliance of indigenous and non-indigenous people. The recently formed Treaty Alliance against Tar Sands Expansion has won support from some 120 chiefs in Canada and the United States. The alliance held an official signing ceremony during the annual meeting of the Assembly of First Nations this week in Gatineau, Que., across the river from Ottawa. The AFNQL opposes the Energy East project, which is currently before the National Energy Board for an environmental assessment. Manitoba's regional chief Kevin Hart is also a supporter of the Treaty Alliance, and he warns that Enbridge will encounter opposition despite the Liberal government's approval. Canadian opponents are teaming up with indigenous American activists who are promising to stop the Enbridge project in Minnesota. Winona Laduke, an Ojibwa from the White Earth reservation, is a veteran of the Standing Rock camps and has been waging the battle against Line 3 south of the border. She said that Enbridge has been misleading people by portraying the project as a rebuild of an existing line, noting it follows a new route through much of Minnesota. The Calgary-based pipeline company is indirectly involved in the Standing Rock fight after having announced it would acquire a minority interest in the project back in August, though it has not yet completed the purchase. Ms. Laduke said that she urged Enbridge to condemn the violence against protesters but the company remained silent. Now, the tribes in Minnesota are preparing for a showdown with Enbridge, whose route skirts the White Earth reservation's treaty area. The Tsleil-Waututh, the Squamish and the Kwantlen are pursuing legal challenges and preparing for direct action. But Tsleil-Waututh Chief Maureen Thomas said her community wants to avoid the confrontation with police that characterized the Standing Rock standoff. Ed John, grand chief of the First Nations Summit, travelled to Standing Rock in late October in his capacity as an expert member of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. He recalled meeting fully armed officers wearing body armour. At its heart, he concluded, the conflict over pipelines and resource development is rooted in government's failure to address the inherent land rights of indigenous people. Federal Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr argues that, in its review of the two pipeline proposals, Ottawa discharged its duty to consult and accommodate First Nations whose traditional territories will be affected by the pipelines. He believes the process will withstand court challenges. Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr. He later apologized for referring to the military, which is not responsible for domestic policing. The comment was seen as particularly galling among the Mohawk leaders at Kanesatake, who were involved in the Oka crisis 26 years ago, when then Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa called out the military to end a standoff over a land dispute between the Mohawks and the town of Oka, Que. Then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney announced and publicly supported that decision. After his remark, Mr. Carr called Kanesatake Chief Serge Simon, who is a key organizer in the Treaty Alliance against Tar Sands Expansion. In the interview, the minister refused to comment on what steps the government would take to end a blockade of a construction site, or to deal with possible conflict. Government security forces, however, have sometimes been accused of blurring the lines between peaceful protest and civil disobedience on the one hand, and extremist criminal activity on the other. Several speakers at the closed-door session spoke on emerging threats from the indigenous community. Of those, 89 were judged to have some propensity toward criminality, and their names are being kept in a data base. One former industry executive says Prime Minister Trudeau may find his greatest challenge was not in approving the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, but in ensuring the critics do not derail a government-sanctioned project. But there is a fundamental divide between that industry view that First Nations do not have a veto, which is widely supported by politicians like B.C. Premier Christy Clark, and the view of indigenous Canadians that they have an inherent right to exercise free, prior and informed consent over development that would have an impact on their traditional territory. The Trudeau government is attempting to bridge that chasm after endorsing the United Nations Declarations on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which includes the principle of free, prior and informed consent. Mr. Carr says that principle does not provide a veto to First Nations who oppose projects, but does require companies and governments to work closely with indigenous communities to ensure they are partners in the evaluation and monitoring of projects, are properly consulted, and have their concerns accommodated. And if Mr. Carr is right, the legal avenue will not provide indigenous pipeline opponents with the answer they are seeking. Indeed, the story of Standing Rock is not over. Under U.S. President Barack Obama, the government backed away from conflict. After ordering the activists to dismantle their camps, Washington did nothing to enforce the ruling. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has responsibility for that segment of the Missouri River, last week handed the Standing Rock Sioux and their allies an exhilarating win by denying the company a permit to cross the river and ordering a new environmental assessment. But with president-elect Donald Trump set to take office next month, there are no illusions that the victory will stand; Mr. Trump's Republican allies have made it clear they expect the pipeline will win approval. If he's right, Canada will be looking for new lessons to draw from the Sioux standoff. Editor's note: An earlier version of this story said the government of then Prime Minister Brian Mulroney called out the military to end a standoff over a land dispute between the Mohawks and the town of Oka, Que. In fact, the government of then Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa called out the military. Mr. Mulroney announced and publicly supported that decision. This is a corrected version.

This is what she's seen A protester meets a police blockade on Highway 1806 near Cannon Ball. Many people were injured when, in sub-zero temperatures, police deployed water cannons, pepper spray, tear gas and rubber bullets. When it was warmer, I would wake up before the sun and work long after it was gone. Now that winter has truly arrived, I have to work a bit slower but my routine is the same: I spend the day talking and connecting with people and their stories. They are stories of community, healing, sacrifice, family, grief, survival and most of all, determination. Thousands of people representing hundreds of tribes and non-indigenous groups, including many Canadians, have gathered together in opposition to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which would transport crude oil beneath sacred Sioux land, including the Missouri River, the source of their drinking water. The last time there was a similar assembly of nations was before the 1876 Battle of the Little Bighorn. In my time at the camp, I've dodged water cannons, tear gas and pepper spray while peaceful demonstrators stood fast. I've watched young Sioux and Crow men tend carefully to their horses. I've seen the gentle and absolute leadership of the Elders. I've been invited to share venison jerky, squash soups, and rice goulash made over the fire and welcomed into warm winter buses, tepees, military tents and wigwams. I've been moved to tears in a morning water ceremony led by women. On Sunday, the Army Corps of Engineers called a halt to the proposed construction, but many feel this victory is tenuous: the company building the project is fighting the Army in court and Donald Trump made the of tapping America's oil reserves one of the centrepieces of his campaign. While some protestors have dispersed, others have vowed to remain gathered in prayer until they are certain their land is safe. The battle for the land has become something larger: a united stand for indigenous rights everywhere. Sun and shadow move across the North Dakota plains near Cannon Ball on Standing Rock Indian Reservation. In the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868, the Sioux Nation agreed to peace in exchange for exclusive use of the sacred Black Hills, and for land in South Dakota, Wyoming and Montana. The U.S. government first seized the Black Hills in 1877, when gold was discovered there. Over the ensuing decades, the government expropriated more and more of the treaty lands. Today, the land is less than half the original size. A young woman listens to speakers after a demonstration in Bismarck, N.D., in November.

Cousins Jiselle Ross, 8, and Ohiya Shaw, 8, wake up for the first time at Sacred Stone Camp near Cannon Ball in September. Riot police outside a Dakota Access Pipeline worker camp in Mandan, N.D. confront protestors who were drawing attention to sexual violence against indigenous women. The violence is exacerbated by the presence of the mostly male work crews that have formed temporary communities around pipeline construction sites. A man is treated with milk of magnesia after being pepper-sprayed at a police blockade on Highway 1806, near Cannon Ball.

Yurts, tepees, military structures, tiny homes, trailers, wigwams and other improvised structures are in use for winter shelter. Amber Bracken is a member of the Rogue Collective of Canadian photojournalists. He was 28 when he lived through the 1990 Oka crisis, during which historically frayed relations were amplified to an explosive degree: In the town of Oka, Que., the Mohawk community became embattled with the provincial police force and the Canadian military to prevent burial grounds from being destroyed to make way for a proposed golf-course expansion and condominium development. Mr. Simon was guiding a small pack of journalists through the pines toward the action the morning that a Quebec police officer was killed in a barrage of bullets, he says. Mr. Simon takes time choosing his words when asked if he fears if history could repeat itself, given the greenlighting of controversial pipeline projects such as Trans Mountain (designed to run from Edmonton through B.C. to the Pacific Coast) and Line 3 (meant to boost capacity on an existing route to the U.S. Midwest), which could likewise encroach on indigenous titles and rights. I cherish peace above all. In Edmonton during the last week of November, Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said that military and police forces could be used to subdue anti-pipeline protests for the sake of public safety. But he adds that, before the AFN meeting on Tuesday, the minister phoned him to apologize for his remarks. Mr. Simon, working alongside numerous chiefs across Canada, has devised a more pacifist mode of opposition: a treaty that would bolster the lobbying power of indigenous people against energy developments such as Alberta's oil sands. As an instrument of unification, the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion includes more than 100 signatories, including David Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. The treaty seeks to preserve and protect what is sacred to them. This week, Mr. Simon spoke to The Globe and Mail about indigenous initiatives to fight pipelines, the situation in North Dakota, and what he sees as echoes of the Oka crisis. I am feeling relieved about the decision. It's more of a stay of execution. Like, we're not going to kill you today. We're talking about a chiefs' alliance, the governing bodies of every respective territory that signs. We're not the grassroots. We could look at lobbying internationally. We could look at the possibility of charging Canada at the International Criminal Court and lobbying international partners, such as Germany, Portugal, Spain, whoever we can have who would be sympathetic to the First Nations here and whatever it is we're fighting. We are First Nations, not first communities or municipalities. We were a nation long before Canada was created, and I think we'll be nations long after it's gone. Investing further into the tar sands is equal to investing in the company that made the last buggy whip. There are some First Nations who are pro-pipeline. They don't have to be. There are alternatives out there. If you want to diversify your community's portfolio, look elsewhere. I'm sitting here with the same damn boots I came into the office with five years ago. My community is also poor. But it will not submit to irresponsible development as a means of making money. My community has a little more integrity. I'm not saying others don't; they're just not informed about what's really going on. Poverty, yes, is a huge incentive to sign on the dotted line. The Canadian government's. National Chief Perry Bellegarde's position on the matter of energy development and indigenous people is neutral. I think Perry is trying to do the best he can in view of Alberta and the First Nations that are benefiting. But then he also has to take into consideration those that are not and those that are just getting all the negative health impacts. Canadian soldier Patrick Cloutier and Ojibwa Brad Larocque come face-to-face in a tense standoff at the Kanesatake reserve in Quebec on Sept. 1, 1990. I was involved with bringing food from the Oka village. I was taking these little trails I knew through the bush and trying to smuggle food up there. I was there that morning when the shooting started. Just as we crossed the field to where the barricade was, we smelled the teargas, saw band members running away. Then all hell broke loose. That's when we dove into the sand. They were running like hell. Our jaws dropped. If one more person died on either side, I think you would have seen a civil war erupt in this country. I saw firsthand when respect and dialogue fail. When the rule of law, when it comes to our treaties and the promises that were made, when those are broken, that's what happens. And that's what we're seeing again. We're seeing partially that same monster rearing its head again. No dialogue, no respect, absolutely no recognition of the law with regards to First Nations and their titles and rights. We can live in peace between the non-native society and ours, like we've always intended through our treaties. Let's say if Canada did to France what they did to First Nations: They would call that an act of war. Julien Gignac is a reporter at The Globe and Mail.

In preparation, we've been helping plan the next international day of action targeting banks to divest from the dangerous project. Today, Bank DNB announced it is going to sell its assets in the Dakota Access Pipeline project. Original petition text: Over 100 water protectors were brutally arrested by Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) security forces -- some locked in dog kennels and shot at with rubber bullets and pepper spray -- just for standing up for their ancestral lands and our most precious resource, water. Thousands have peacefully gathered in person and in solidarity to stop this 570,000 barrel-per-day pipeline that would endanger the water and ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. And while this inspiring work is going on, the banks that we use every day are backing the project with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and investment each. Demand your bank to stop financially supporting from the Dakota Access Pipeline and associated projects such as Energy Transfer now. North Dakota recorded nearly 300 oil pipeline spills in less than two years -- and none were disclosed to the public. The DAPL was originally going to be routed near the city of Bismarck -- but was rejected because it would have run so close to municipal water sources. Bank DNB, BBVA, TD, Wells Fargo, Mizuho Bank, BayernLB, Citibank, ING, Deutsche Bank, RBC, Credit Suisse, UBS, Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole, Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, and ABN Amro Capital all support the project financially. These banks are vulnerable to public pressure. We are their customers and shareholders -- and they need our business. Stop the money, stop a pipeline. Tell your bank to stop funding the project now. What we are bearing witness to at Standing Rock is a moment of history. We can't all be in North Dakota, but we can all stand in solidarity with those who are. Which is why after you sign the petition, we will list other ways you can support to help the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. This community is powerful when it comes together. Now, we need to come together now and help the Standing Rock Sioux stop the Dakota Access Pipeline.

The pressure on US Bank to end its relationship with oil and gas pipeline companies has been mounting over the last five months. Late last year, dozens of groups sent the bank a letter, demanding an end to its financing of Energy Transfer Partners (ETP). Instead, US Bank doubled down and joined a massive new credit facility for ETP. Despite the national attention generated by Standing Rock during the Dakota Access fight, ETP is still finding money to build new pipeline projects around the country, including the Bayou Bridge, Mariner East 2, and Rover Pipelines. And at the Annual Shareholder Meeting, these resistance leaders came to tell their stories. Outside the meeting, activists rallied at the Hyatt Regency Albuquerque, led by local Indigenous leaders and others from across the state fighting fracking in the Greater Chaco Region. Business press covering the US Bank meeting attended the rally as well, and wrote about it later that day. Following the meeting, US Bank refused to comment to media, then posted a recording of the Annual Meeting excluding the Q&A section.

The mining company, through a court order, has claimed these indigenous territories without prior consultation or consent from the affected communities, who have lived there for hundreds of years. The land allocated for the project covers over 41,000 hectares and the forced evacuation of other Shuar communities is expected. Since the August eviction, the county of San Juan Bosco has been militarized to quell protest. In November, several Shuar people attempted to reclaim the indigenous territory of Nankints within the San Juan Bosco county. Clashes broke out with police and military personnel guarding the mining camp, leaving several injured. The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador (CONAIE), and the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon (CONFENIAE), called for dialogue with the Government to avoid further confrontations but no resolution was reached. On Wednesday December 14th, a new confrontation took place in the mining camp, leaving one police officer dead and others wounded. After these events, the Ecuadorian Government announced a state of exception throughout the Morona Santiago province, stripping residents of the rights to freedom of movement, freedom of association, freedom of assembly and inviolability of the home, among others. The Government also deployed over 700 elite soldiers and policemen, military tanks, trucks and helicopters to San Juan Bosco to join the existing military presence there. According to witness testimony, army rifle blasts have caused women and children to seek refuge in the mountains. Military personnel and police are patrolling the streets in armoured vehicles. The community is in a state of terror. An online petition has been addressed to key decision makers in the Ecuadorian Government demanding: the demilitarization of San Juan Bosco and dialogue to avoid further confrontation and acts of violence. adherence to international law and the Ecuadorian Constitution, both of which forbid the presence of military personnel in indigenous territories and require prior, informed and free consultations before the implementation of mining or oil projects.

Army veterans return to Standing Rock to form a human shield against police Read more The charges against two veterans, who said they use medical cannabis to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, come days after a veterans service organization announced it would be returning to Standing Rock to provide support. News of the charges adds to growing concerns that law enforcement is aggressively monitoring, arresting and prosecuting people affiliated with the anti-pipeline movement. The Guardian recently reported that an FBI terrorism task force has attempted to contact at least three people tied to the demonstrations. Matthew Crane, one of five founding members of VeteransRespond, was pulled over last Friday night when he was arriving to Standing Rock with two other vets and a fourth passenger. The group got lost on a closed road, he said, and they were trying to find officers to get directions.

He lives in New York, where medical cannabis is also legal. On Thursday, police in Mobridge, South Dakota, arrested two individuals that officials claimed were VeteransRespond members. Sanderson, however, said they were not members, although one of them, Travis Biolette, is now loosely affiliated with the group, which is assisting him in his charges.

Photograph: Courtesy of Travis Biolette A police search found hash oil, which is classified as a controlled substance in South Dakota. Biolette and his friend were taken to jail in Selby, South Dakota. In a phone interview Monday night, Biolette said he spent four nights in jail and was released earlier in the day. He said that police pulled him over for speeding about six miles above the limit and that when he revealed he was going to Standing Rock, the officer launched a search. He said the hash oil is his prescribed medication, which he uses for PTSD and major depressive disorder. Biolette, who is now getting support from VeteransRespond members who picked him up from jail, said police still have his vehicle with all of his possessions, including his cold-weather clothing. Nonetheless, he was still planning on Monday night to go to Standing Rock, which he also visited last year. VeteransRespond has said it intends to help Standing Rock leaders on camp with a range of responsibilities, including cleanup efforts, kitchen help and medical aid.

In 1890, police murdered Sitting Bull on the Standing Rock reservation out of suspicion that he was preparing to lead the Ghost Dance movement in an uprising. Two weeks later the United States Cavalry massacred more than three hundred Lakota at Wounded Knee. Over 126 years later, the characters and details of the stories that animate this landscape have changed, but the Cowboys and Indians remain locked in the same grim dance. For many, it is contentious and even laughable to suggest that colonialism endures in the present. In the American popular imagination, colonialism ended either when the 13 colonies declared independence from Britain in 1776, or when John Wayne and the 6th Cavalry blasted away Geronimo and the Apaches in Stagecoach. Colonialism, according to these narratives, is history. The eviction of Oceti Sakowin suggests otherwise. That is almost three times the national average. Schools are failing. Healthcare is inadequate. Many depend on unsafe wells for water. Roads are often unpaved. Housing is in short supply, substandard and overcrowded. If the people of Standing Rock did not take-in their beloved family and friends, there would be mass homelessness. The pipeline will pour even more wealth into his pockets. Meanwhile, Standing Rock will remain in poverty on the margins. The most expensive piece of infrastructure in their community will not be the schools, homes or hospitals they desperately need. Instead it will be a pipeline that they have vehemently opposed. This is how the first people of this land live in the forgotten Bantustans of the American West. This system, an essential foundation of the United States, is rooted in the theft of indigenous land and the ongoing disavowal of indigenous sovereignty. Indigenous presence must be confined, erased and then forgotten, so that the United States may continue to live upon and profit mightily from lands taken from indigenous people. The erasure of indigenous people explains why Dakota Access was rerouted from upstream of Bismarck south to Standing Rock. It explains why pipelines can be hammered through Native communities without regard to their treaties and indigenous, constitutional and human rights. It explains why a multi-billion dollar pipe can be drilled through Standing Rock before long-needed basic infrastructure is built. It explains how, after months of unprecedented protests and visibility, Trump can claim that he received no complaints about the pipeline. It explains how Oceti Sakowin can be wiped off the map. It is impossible to describe the totality of this picture of land theft, containment, poverty, oppression, policing and extraction as anything other than colonialism. They have lit a fire on the prairie in the heart of America as a symbol of their resistance, a movement that stands for something that is undoubtedly right: water that sustains life, and land that gave birth to people.

Photo courtesy of Aaron Carapella By Katherine Locke Originally Published: December 13, 2016 11:10 a.m. Share Tweet FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. The maps Carapella usually make show where Native people were pre-European contact. This map still shows where Native people were, but also shows how proposed pipelines currently in the works border or are on tribal land, like the Dakota Access Pipeline. Carapella said a big inspiration for making the map was Winona LaDuke, a vice-presidential candidate under Ralph Nadar in 1996 and 2000. She is a well-known Native American environmental activist Carapella met at a school in Massachusetts where they were both guest speakers. She is also the executive director of Honor the Earth, which has played a big role in the Dakota Access Pipeline protest. He found she was trying to get the mostly white students, who attend a very expensive preparatory school, to realize their fight against a pipeline in their neighborhood is the same fight Native people are fighting, but Native people have fewer resources and less clout. But Native people have always been in those places. Carapella sees the protest at Standing Rock in North Dakota as one of the biggest gatherings of Native people since Custer and Crazy Horse. With a history of activism in the American Indian Movement, Carapella has been involved in some big land occupations that extended for months at a time, similar, he says, to Wounded Knee and what is going on now at Standing Rock. I have a lot of friends who have come and gone and who are there now. With many pipelines in the process of becoming reality, Standing Rock stands out because of its worldwide attention and the many tribes who are supporting it. Carapella said one reason for that is the history the Standing Rock Sioux have in the country. He adds the Navajo and Hopi to that list, who were some of the last to assimilate or give up to the U.S. Army. He compares some of those tribes to ones who are more assimilated, like the ones where he is from in Oklahoma. With his maps, Carapella has always tried to show the differences between tribes who remained on their homeland and the ones who were ripped off their land and forced onto the Trail of Tears. So they identify with the places around the camp, they have names for all the ridges, valleys and rivers in their language. Even with tribes who are not active and who would not stage something like the Sioux Tribe has, tribes like the Choctaw or the Cherokee, have been sending supplies to support the people protesting. With a new administration coming in he said indigenous people are gearing up for a fight that is never ending, which is something that his pipeline map shows. Even if the Standing Rock Sioux prevail in court and on the ground, there are many fights across the country that are coming. With workers who have been laid off who have the potential to make a lot of money constructing the pipelines, the fight is a hard one and one that can get lost in an economic message that is appealing without looking at the bigger picture. And while Carapella realizes that some structures need to be in place for delivering energy to people in a society with 300 million people, he said the government needs to think before they try to put in pipelines right around reservation borders. Most of this land was stolen after a treaty breaking. Hollywood and John Wayne movies have shown that, Carapella said. Carpella asked. Smaller tribes who offered less resistance and were more peaceful are rarely shown on maps, though Carapella includes them on his. Carapella said that is because America started out as a pretty violent place and revering aggression, guns and violence is in our culture. Unlike his other maps, Carapella is not sure where he is going with this map. He said there is a possibility of updating it every six months or so, to take off pipelines that have been completed and adding ones that are planned or are in progress. He also said it was impossible to include all the pipelines across the country and that he knows he may have missed some. Carapella acknowledges that some pipelines can be good and the alternative is to transport by train or by truck, which have their own dangers, but he wants people to be aware of the dangers, most likely a leak at some point. He also wants people to understand it is not just the Sioux who are affected by the pipelines. The Sioux are contesting two broken treaties, the 1851 treaty and the 1868 Ft. Laramie treaty. But Carapella said there were 371 treaties that were broken by the government. Carapella said. Submissions must adhere to our Use of Service Terms of Use agreement.

Police and private security forces outfitted in riot gear and armed with assault weapons have unleashed dogs, pepper spray and rubber bullets on peaceful Native Americans and their allies. Overzealous law enforcement officials in North Dakota have jailed journalists and celebrities who were exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech and the press by documenting police attacks on protesters. These actions are a serious affront to the Constitution and sovereign tribal rights and are an egregious abuse of power by the police and government in order to protect the fossil fuel industry. Tell North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple and the U.S. Department of Justice: Stop police abuse and protect the Constitution, not the fossil fuel industry. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of over 200 other tribes from across the Americas are leading the resistance to protect sovereign land and drinking water from destruction by the fossil fuel industry. However, in an attempt to quell these historic nonviolent protests, Gov. Dalrymple ordered a state of emergency that has militarized the police force, set up a highway roadblock and mobilized the National Guard to intimidate protesters. Her reporting went viral, with over 14 million people on Facebook and millions more through the mainstream media viewing her reporting. Tell North Dakota Gov.

Ink has been up for roughly two weeks as part of a larger blockade resistance in the path of the proposed Mountain Valley Pipeline. As many as nine people have taken to the skies in Appalachia in the past three months. Six tree-sitters have come down under various circumstances, and the flames of resistance have spread at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains. Another activist known as Nutty was perched in a monopod at the top of a 50-foot pole from March 28 to May 23. She came down after being blocked from receiving food and water by law enforcement in Giles County. Three aerial blockaders remain aloft at different sites along the pipeline route in one of the most elaborate environmentalist resistance efforts ever seen. For now, Ink remains in the sky. Another tree-sitter Fern MacDougal recently launched an aerial blockade further up the road that Nutty had been blocking two days before Nutty came down. As a result of this direct action, MVP still cannot bring construction equipment up Peters Mountain. They are also blocked from bringing extraction equipment or or any drilling infrastructure up to the proposed drill pad site being blocked by Deckard.

Things went from bad to worse on October 21, when the pipeline's supporters attacked a group of protesters, killing one, wounding eight, and causing substantial property damage. The Yaqui tribe, which has endured a long history of repression, has also a history of resistance. Like other indigenous communities in Mexico, several members of the Yaqui tribe have lost their lives fighting against invasive private companies and non-indigenous authorities. Just two years ago, before the conflict over the Agua Prieta pipeline, the Yaquis protested against a large-scale aqueduct that would have diverted what was left of their sacred river to the city of Hermosillo. According to its design, the Agua Prieta pipeline project stretches from Arizona, in the United States, to Sonora, Mexico. One portion of the pipeline is to cross 90 kilometers into Yaqui territory, which is protected by Mexican law. Building the pipeline without fair, transparent, and inclusive consultations with all the Yaqui communities would be a violation of the sovereignty of the Yaqui land, community leaders say. They are those who do not care if an indigenous government falls. They are those who do not care if the Yaqui culture is exterminated. They have received threats because they opposed the signing of the collective permit for the construction of the pipeline. Last month, Gema Villela Valenzuela reported that members of the Yaqui community are still receiving threats for opposing the pipeline. This article was published previously by Global Voices.

Distribute. Fallen Warriors Obituaries to fallen warriors. Journal. Given the complex land ownership and public access rules that govern the bayou, handing discretionary arrest powers to a private company is particularly controversial. Crawfish producers and environmental justice groups have pursued legal strategies and direct-action campaigns to stop the project. If prosecution of the arrestees moves ahead, attorneys may use the criminal cases as a springboard to argue that HB 727 is overly vague and broad, and infringes on free expression. For two weeks prior to the first arrests under the new law, pipeline opponents paddled in the public waters transected by the pipeline easement, prompting workers to halt construction. Spoon said the officers then reached down and yanked the two women from their boat by the wrists, placing them in handcuffs. The security guards also arrested a third Bayou Bridge pipeline opponent who was kayaking nearby. The protesters were charged with unauthorized entry of a critical infrastructure facility and resisting arrest. They were released later that day. Pam Spees, a senior staff attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights who is representing groups opposed to the Bayou Bridge project, said the situation raises important concerns about whose interests are being protected. In an interview with The Intercept, Pastorick estimated that roughly 50 state probation and parole officers had gained outside employment with the security company Hub Enterprises, which was hired by Energy Transfer Partners to guard the Bayou Bridge pipeline during construction. But he said that as of August 13, department personnel were no longer working for Hub. He was not aware of the reason behind the shift. A spokesperson referred inquiries to an email address for Energy Transfer Partners media relations. These situations are dealt with by local law enforcement. One officer walked to the base of the trees and announced into a bullhorn: If anyone was occupying the tree-sits, they were now committing a felony and must come down immediately. Unbeknownst to the deputy, he was calling up to empty platforms. Aware that the bill was about to take effect, the tree-sitters had already abandoned their perches. One of the trees supporting the skypod was on the pipeline construction path. But the skypod itself was not, and thus was theoretically not subject to prosecution under HB 727. Legal filings indicate that the company only began the eminent domain process after it started construction. ETP spokesperson Granado told The Intercept that the expropriation process is underway, and that more than 800 people have rights to the land. Another landowner, Peter Aaslestad, has a pending legal case demanding that ETP stop construction. Three other pipeline opponents and one independent journalist embedded with the group, Karen Savage, were arrested and charged under the new law for refusing to leave. But Savage disputes trespassing in a critical infrastructure construction zone. A sixth water protector was also arrested under other charges. Today, Leighton continues to work security for pipeline projects that have attracted local opposition, hiring primarily local law enforcement officers. Both the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines pass through West Virginia and Virginia; the Atlantic Coast pipeline also runs through North Carolina. Journal Collective.

There is a natural gas pipeline being built from Arizona to Sonora, Mexico that runs through 90 kilometers of protected Yaqui tribal land. Construction started even though a court had suspended its building. The Mexican authorities claimed one community could not stop something that will benefit many future generations to come. This pipeline runs through protected lands and needs to be stopped as it threatens the ecosystem as well as the people of the Yaqui tribe. Already, two people have been kidnapped and one has been killed in the fight to stop this pipeline. Anabela Carlon Flores, a Yaqui activist that taught community members to make films about indigenous rights, was abducted along with her husband. She has since been set free, but her husband remains missing. One person has been killed, along with eight others injured in a clash between supporters and non-supporters of the pipeline. The pipeline itself has impacts outside of the Yaqui community. The gas that flows through the pipeline is mostly methane, a known greenhouse gas that causes climate change. A leak could be devastating to the ecosystem around the pipeline. Sign this petition to stop the pipeline and protect the Yaqui tribe. PETITION LETTER: Dear President Nieto, A pipeline is being built trough northern Mexico that threatens over 50 miles of protected land. The backlash to this pipeline has already caused two people to be abducted, many injured, and one killed. The Yaqui tribe have demonstrated against the pipeline and succeeded in suspending the construction, but that was overlooked by your government. This pipeline not only threatens the Yaqui tribe, but also countless plant and animals species that exist around it. A natural gas leak would be devastating to the ecosystem, and the risk is not worth taking. The well-being of the Yaqui tribe as well as the survival of their protected land should not be put in jeopardy by this pipeline. Please use your power as president to stop this pipeline from being built and protect our environment for generations to come.

The U.S. stole sacred land and killed off nations--not only the people, but their culture and livelihood. For the first time, the U.S. has allowed a United Nations fact-finding mission to determine the impact of the passage of the proposed Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People. The 12-day fact-finding mission was performed by James Anaya, a professor of human rights law and policy at the University of Arizona. This mission took Anaya all over Indian Country and up to Alaska to determine the experience of Natives in this country. He will be presenting his finding in September to U.N. Human Rights Council. A girl plays outside her home on an American Indian reservation ONE OF the headline-catching recommendations from Anaya was that the U.S. government return some stolen land to Native tribe as a way forward toward reconciliation. One specific piece of land recommended is Mount Rushmore, which is located in the Black Hills National Park in South Dakota--historically sacred land for the Lakota (Sioux). This land was stolen after gold was found in the Black Hills, in violation of the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1868. In 1980, the Supreme Court decided that the seizure of the Black Hills from the Lakota was illegal and stated that the U.S. needed to compensate the Lakota for the land. The Lakota refused the money, instead demanding their land back. The findings of the UN mission are no surprise since the U.S. was founded on stolen land--along with stolen labor. The U.S. continued to expand westward in an effort to find new markets and new resources. In 1871, the U.S. discontinued the treaty process with Native tribes. From this point, the policy of the U.S. government was to assimilate Indians into white society. Young Indians were forced to go to boarding schools, where they had to cut their hair and were forbidden from speaking their native tongue. It wasn't until the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 that Indians were given the right to vote, which makes them the last minority in this country to win the franchise. The same law allowed tribes to have democratically elected councils to govern their reservations. Though these councils were set up by the U.S. government, and often used by them, this was a step towards sovereignty. The 1970s saw a rise in American Indian struggle. This came in the form of the American Indian Movement (AIM), which looked to bring the injustices endured by Native peoples to the forefront again. Actions such as the occupation of Alcatraz Island, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Wounded Knee, the site of the Wounded Knee massacre in 1890, brought the issue of Native rights back in the mainstream. As a result of this pressure, the U.S. government passed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1980. The act states: That henceforth it shall be the policy of the United States to protect and preserve for American Indians their inherent right of freedom to believe, express, and exercise the traditional religions of the American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiians, including but not limited to access to sites, use and possession of sacred objects, and the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional rites. This act supposedly gave Native Americans access to sacred sites--but that's often at odds with the interests of the government when the sites are on line that is rich in natural resources. One example is uranium mining in the Navajo Nation in Arizona and New Mexico. The mining for uranium not only destroyed the land and the health of many Navajos, but it helped fuel the U.S. war machine. In 2010, President Obama stated that the U.S. government supported the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous People. To get an idea of the what the declaration conveys, Article 3 states: Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. The reality is the administration has done very little to push for the rights of indigenous people. It passed the Tribal Law and Order Act, which further militarizes reservations with the addition of more police and judges. This seems more important to federal officials than addressing housing shortages and astronomical unemployment rates on reservations. The recommendations by the UN mission will put the U.S. government on the spot. Although it's unlikely that the U.S. will be responsive to a UN recommendation, the results of this mission create an opening to bring indigenous issues back into the mainstream debate. The indigenous people of this country are still fighting the same fight as their brothers and sisters of the past. We need to stand up for their rights against a system that continues the exploitation of Native people and land.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Susan Sarandon has participated in demonstrations against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Story highlights Actress' petition calls on people to withdraw money until banks divest The petition asks people to film themselves withdrawing money and tweet it (CNN)You've shared the protest videos and checked in at Standing Rock Indian Reservation on Facebook. Actress Susan Sarandon hopes so. She has launched an online petition that calls on people to tell big banks to stop investing in the company behind the pipeline. Supporters say it will be an economic boon that will decrease dependency on foreign oil. Opponents say it will destroy sacred Native American sites and wreak environmental havoc. Read More The petition singles out Bank of America, HSBC, UBS, Wells Fargo, Chase and Citibank, which are named in various SEC filings as lenders or partners in groups that support the pipeline. The pipeline complies with so-called Equator Principles that determine and manage risks and the impact of a project, the bank said. Bank of America is not a lender in the project-level financing and has contributed to Native American communities through various initiatives, spokeswoman Kelly Sapp said. SEC records indicate the bank is in a partnership with Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Dakota Access LLC. Similarly, UBS spokesman Peter Stack said the bank does not provide project funding, but SEC documents show an investment partnership with Sunoco in Bakken Holdings Company LLC, which has an interest in Dakota Access LLC and other companies contributing to pipeline construction. HSBC declined to comment, and the other banks did return requests for comment. The petition asks signatories to withdraw money from their accounts and place money into credit unions until banks agree to divest and pressure the White House for an environmental impact statement. The petition tells people to film themselves withdrawing money and explaining why they're doing it, and to tweet it. They have put their bodies on the line to stop the construction and defend their water and their way of life. Less than 24 hours after Sarandon launched the petition on Wednesday night, it had nearly 29,000 supporters. It's not clear. So far, there are no photos or videos on Twitter of people in the act.

In preparation, we've been helping plan the next international day of action targeting banks to divest from the dangerous project. Today, Bank DNB announced it is going to sell its assets in the Dakota Access Pipeline project. Original petition text: Over 100 water protectors were brutally arrested by Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) security forces -- some locked in dog kennels and shot at with rubber bullets and pepper spray -- just for standing up for their ancestral lands and our most precious resource, water. Thousands have peacefully gathered in person and in solidarity to stop this 570,000 barrel-per-day pipeline that would endanger the water and ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. And while this inspiring work is going on, the banks that we use every day are backing the project with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and investment each. Demand your bank to stop financially supporting from the Dakota Access Pipeline and associated projects such as Energy Transfer now. North Dakota recorded nearly 300 oil pipeline spills in less than two years -- and none were disclosed to the public. The DAPL was originally going to be routed near the city of Bismarck -- but was rejected because it would have run so close to municipal water sources. Bank DNB, BBVA, TD, Wells Fargo, Mizuho Bank, BayernLB, Citibank, ING, Deutsche Bank, RBC, Credit Suisse, UBS, Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole, Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, and ABN Amro Capital all support the project financially. These banks are vulnerable to public pressure. We are their customers and shareholders -- and they need our business. Stop the money, stop a pipeline. Tell your bank to stop funding the project now. What we are bearing witness to at Standing Rock is a moment of history. We can't all be in North Dakota, but we can all stand in solidarity with those who are. Which is why after you sign the petition, we will list other ways you can support to help the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. This community is powerful when it comes together. Now, we need to come together now and help the Standing Rock Sioux stop the Dakota Access Pipeline.

The platform on which she sat was about the size of a bathtub. Her final three days in the trees were spent without food. Photograph: Garrett MacLean for the Guardian There are others, too, who remain in the forest and are still blocking construction by putting their lives on the line and refusing to move. On the far side of the mountain sits a man in a perch dangling from a tree. A bald gash of clearcut, about as wide as a truck is long, runs through the forest, up the mountain, and stops just at the tree from which he hangs. A handful of folks have also taken to the trees in a place called Little Teel Crossing, and just this Monday, a woman named Fern MacDougal made her new home in another aerial blockade on Peters Mountain. A mother and daughter team, nicknamed Red and Minor respectively, came down from the trees after more than 30 days, on property that has been in their family for more than seven generations. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Red and Minor, mother and daughter pipeline protesters, stand in front of Bottom Creek. But they also say this is about more than just a pipeline, built by Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC. It is, they say, also about the erosion of democracy and the natural world by money and the hunger for it. They see this pipeline as one more physical manifestation of the loss of personal agency in the face of an impersonal and uncaring government. The Appalachian plateau makes you believe it. Facebook Twitter Pinterest At dusk, the Appalachian Mountains extend into the distance. Red works as a forklift driver and Minor is a bookkeeper for a small business. Both of their employers bent the rules so they could take to the trees and keep their jobs. Red spent 33 consecutive days suspended on a 4x8 sheet of plywood between an oak and a maple, and Minor 34 hanging from a single oak. Both list the steps they and others have taken to fight it: the comment periods unheeded, the independent environmental and archeological studies snubbed, the court challenges lost, the demonstrations ignored, the politicians petitioned and rebuffed. None of these actions worked. And so they say they have to resort to non-violent civil disobedience to overcome what they see as a rigged system. The two Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners who voted to approve the pipeline were appointed by Donald Trump, who has taken millions from energy companies, including NextEra donating a quarter-million dollars to his inauguration. Activists also note the dozens of spills already happening each year; what they see as the arrogance of clearcutting trees before all permits along the route are secured. And while pipeline construction is said to bring economic benefit to the state, a common refrain among residents remains that license plates of pipeline trucks read Utah and Texas and Oklahoma. They add that this is all happening on land stolen from Native Americans during the European-American genocide of the race in the first place. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Friends and supporters gathered at the Mountain Mama festival to raise funds to help Red pay the fines levied again her for her tree sit protest. The water was cool and sweet and clean. Photograph: Garrett MacLean for the Guardian Tree sits are often most closely associated with the environmental activism of the 1980s and 1990s opposing the clearcutting of old-growth forest in the American west. Activists often try to make the process of extraction as difficult as possible. If any of the wires had been disturbed, she could have come crashing to the ground and died. There are two reasons protesters like her often use nicknames and wear a balaclava to hide their faces. Crucial to the tree sits are the support camps that surround them. On Peters Mountain there are two, one on each side of the state line, populated by a roving cast of supporters, mostly women, who by now almost live in semi-permanent camps in the Jefferson and Washington national forest. On the Virginia side the hike in from the road takes at least an hour each way over gnarly terrain, a path activists blazed parallel to a public road, now closed by the US Forest Service police. There was a strange standoff between the support camp and the police across the boundary just a few yards away. The police antagonized the supporters with bright lights and generators and near daily pounds through the camp to count heads and tents and ask questions. One night, three supporters crossed the line and attempted to resupply Nutty and were all arrested. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Throughout the night, law enforcement officers run generators and shine spotlights directly into the support camp of the monopod protester. He was echoed by a man calling himself Ink atop the trees at Little Teel Crossing, south-east of where Deckard hangs. He had been up in the trees a week, and police have only just set up their blockade. He will not get any more food aside from what he has with him until he touches ground. Along with the others now in the air, he stocked for a long, drawn out fight and has a long way to go. Photograph: Garrett MacLean for the Guardian Yet activists say they have already come so far. At the West Virginia Mine Wars Museum, board member Wilma Steele explained the story of the largest armed insurrection in the US since the civil war, an early fight for unionization where scores of workers were killed by private security guards supported by the US government, which ultimately bombed its own citizens. It all happened just under 100 years ago in the very region where people now sit in the trees. The miners were largely defeated in their immediate goals, but laid the groundwork for one of the largest unionization movements in the world. They are steeped in their history and know something needs to be done. This is their future. This is their world. Please choose your username under which you would like all your comments to show up.

They are our sisters. We are from the same blood. U.S. Army Corps says Standing Rock camp to be closed by Dec. 5 Energy Transfer Partners, builder of Dakota Access pipeline, to merge with another firm On Friday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the main camp used by the people opposed to the pipeline will be closed by Dec. 5. The protestors have stayed, despite dropping temperatures and a violent clash with police on Nov. 20. More than 500 people have been arrested in demonstrations since the summer. First Nations leaders are assembling to protest at the First Nation located along Highway 1 about 90 kilometres West of Winnipeg. The violence has to stop. They have to stop doing what they are doing to our people. Pashe said he and other leaders are prepared to join the Dakota south of the border if they are needed, but will wait for tribal leaders to ask them to join.

One has been broadly building worker committees in banks in the United States. The Bank Workers campaign, the Committee for Better Banks, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) and a whole series of community groups, which we will come back to, were the whistleblowers on the Wells Fargo scandal, where they were opening fake accounts. There is an ongoing, growing campaign with workers in all the major US banks, but what we are focusing on now is a bank called Santander, which a Spanish-owned bank. In the United States they are primarily in the Northeast. There is now a global demand on the bank that they agree not to fight the union and be neutral, the same in the United States as in other countries. Workers should not be forced to sell predatory products or cheat people as a condition of employment. There has always been a dual demand. The traditional demand about how workers should be paid and treated decently, and simultaneously that workers should not be forced to sell predatory products or cheat people as a condition of employment. That is why the work with Wells Fargo has been so exciting, because literally thousands of workers have signed petitions saying these outrageous sales goals could only be met if they cheated customers. SJ: One of the things that is interesting about this is the connection with these international unions that represent bank workers. SL: What is unique about the bank workers organizing is the Brazilian Bank Workers, one of the biggest bank workers unions in the world and one of the most progressive, have aggressively and wonderfully called on the American labor movement to organize bank workers. It is not just out of solidarity. They cannot maintain the standards they have won in Brazil and around the world if the largest country with the biggest finance industry is nonunion. It is almost hallucinogenic to have workers in so-called developing countries say that their wages and benefits are threatened by the level of nonunion staff in the United States. There is this fantastic group led by the Brazilian Bank Workers and UNI, the global bank worker federation, that is working both to support the campaign and pressure the company, but also, around the globe, has lifted up this call, which I think is really unusual for unions, for workers to not be pressured to cheat people as a condition of employment. We are going to the Santander shareholder meeting in Spain. They just failed their Community Reinvestment Act test and we did a report on that. We are building a campaign not just about what is good for workers, but about workers who will make the company healthier in terms of how it engages with customers. Essentially, the Community Reinvestment Act requires banks to provide resources to the communities that they are in, to invest in them. We did a report showing that their lending practices ignored or skipped over poor communities and communities of color. There is a test that is done under the CRA Act to see if you have loaned enough money. The bank failed it. The bank also failed the stress test. We think there is a relationship between mistreatment of workers and the underpinnings of the bank being threatened because they are engaged in all sorts of risky practices that may make them a little bit of money in the short run, but then blow up on their face in the long run. SJ: One of the things that connects a lot of the work you do is mapping where the power and the money comes from for bad policies and bad politicians. Those are policies that are bipartisan, we should say. In the age of Donald Trump, in particular, talk about the importance of this kind of work and why it is important to know who is funding your politicians. Our little joke is that we have either been incredibly prescient or Trump picked his entire cabinet by looking at who we have been fighting. SL: The Hedge Clippers campaign looks at hedge funds and private equity, thus hedge clippers clipping their power. Our little joke is that we have either been incredibly prescient or Trump picked his entire Cabinet by looking at who we have been fighting. Pre-Trump winning, we were saying whether it is Goldman Sachs or Steven Schwarzman from Blackstone, these are the people who are really running the government. Lots of folks are laughing saying we are a conspiracy cult or something. Then, when Trump got elected, he put all of these people directly in charge. We are doing a lot of work on mapping the different Trump worlds. Then, there are the Steve Schwarzmans and the Carl Icahns and this other set of players that run committees for him. So, they can essentially create government policies that will further enrich their companies. Then, there is a third set of people like John Paulson, who made all his money in the housing crisis, who may not be directly working for Trump, but who supported him and is now going to reap the benefits. For example, he is heavily invested in Puerto Rico. What we have been looking at is, how do you identify the corporate collaborators with Trump, and then look at ways to start putting pressure on them so that they pay a price for the fact that they are in bed with Trump. One thing is that many of these folks have significant investments from public employee pension plans and college endowments. We have an ongoing campaign saying that pension funds and endowments basically are getting lousy deals from these guys, meaning they pay a lot of money to invest in them and they get poor returns. An example is Robert Mercer whose family owns part of Breitbart and Cambridge Analytica. We want to start raising the issue for a bunch of these people that we should cut off their capital. Another thing we are doing is introducing legislation on a state-by-state basis to tax the carried interest exemption. This is a loophole that lets them take the regular income that most people pay 30-35 percent on and they get to take 15 percent. I think there is a sweet irony of their greed, that in getting into bed with Trump, it may make them much more susceptible to cutting off their capital. One of the ways we can hurt them is by cutting off tax breaks and cutting off investment. I think there is a sweet irony of their greed, that in getting into bed with Trump, it may make them much more susceptible to cutting off their capital. This is one of the pieces that I think is the most critical, which is showing that the people that Trump has put in charge, like Wilbur Ross, are job destroyers. It is not evil foreigners or immigrants. That lets you raise a whole set of issues in terms of showing who they are and then, all the different ways that they gamed the system to enrich themselves at the expense of workers. SJ: This campaigning has been going on around the Dakota Access Pipeline with people and cities, in fact, divesting from Wells Fargo and other banks that are invested in that pipeline. SL: Wells Fargo workers exposed how they were cheating consumers, but there is now a campaign called Forego Wells. They treat their workers terribly. They rob consumers. They are a funder of the Dakota Access Pipeline. They fund private prisons. They fund, in some ways, payday lending. Wells Fargo is a wonderful example of the corruption and debasement of the system. They have binding arbitration. If you have an account with them, you automatically give up the right to sue them. The way I think about it is, we have to make Trump guilty of every evil and sin they commit. If Trump picked Elaine Chao, then he is supporting fake accounts. He is supporting all of these things. On the other hand, anybody who associates with Trump has to be guilty of all of his sins. Jamie Dimon from JPMorgan and Lloyd Blankfein from Goldman Sachs like to pretend they are at least social progressives. Gary Cohn, who is a Goldman Sachs guy, went over to the administration and stood behind Trump when he signed the Muslim ban. We need to hold Goldman Sachs accountable. I think there is a fantastic opportunity to force these contradictions, drive some wedges in the ruling class, and really tell the story about what used to be secret. These are the guys that are running both the economy and the government.

Story by Amos Barshad Photography by Sara Lafleur-Vetter Share Tweet Lorna Hanes is tall, and of firm gait. She wears her long brown hair loose, leaving it to brush over her broad shoulders. Fifteen years ago, when she was 35, she met Winona LaDuke, the famed Ojibwe indigenous rights activist. Eventually, LaDuke would adopt Hanes as a sister and set her on her own path of activism. ADVERTISEMENT She now lives with LaDuke on the White Earth reservation, in Minnesota, and works with LaDuke's Honor The Earth organization. Hanes lovingly recalls past pipeline rides that snaked through the Badlands of the Dakotas, on ridges miles above twinkling lights of car traffic, on paths surrounded by treacherous openings into seemingly bottomless caverns. The sprawling camps, full of people who call themselves Water Protectors, exist in defiance of the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, or DAPL. Back then, the landscape was all greens and browns. While LaDuke moved back and forth tending to business in Minnesota, Hanes lived on the land with her horse, Lucky. Within weeks of the sisters arrival, a group of activists in a confrontation with construction workers were attacked by DAPL security guards with pepper-spray and trained dogs that bit both people and horses. My sister was really pissed off. The Morton County Sheriff's Department is the presiding law enforcement body in this part of the country. But over the months of the standoff, 76 other law enforcement organizations have volunteered time or material support. In one notorious incident from November, activists attempted to remove burned-out trucks, remnants from a past altercation, from in front of the barricade. In response, Morton County opened up powerful hoses gushing water in freezing weather. During the skirmish, a 21-year-old woman named Sophia Wilansky suffered a severe arm injury and faced a possible amputation from what her family says was a law enforcement concussion grenade. Down the road a bit, on North Dakota State Route 1806, scattered black beef cattle break up the thick, clean monochrome of fresh snow. On the other side is the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and the camps of activists. Just days before I arrive, in early December, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had issued an evacuation order. They then issued a map indicating a small sliver of land where the activists would be allowed to stay. Today, white helicopters swirl around the blockade. Behind the DAPL side of the cement barriers of the barricade, uniformed, helmeted men stick out of their armored vehicles, almost like tank commanders surveying a battlefield. Right now, here on Route 1806, save for the crunch of boots in the snow, there is silence. Farther back, the mass of the Standing Rock camps hum. For the last few weeks, stoves have been installed with fervor; now, the pleasant smells of burning wood greet the camp every morning. Axes swing down on small logs for firewood. Chainsaws roar down on the big ones. Dogs wear clothes, horses run free, cars get stuck constantly, kids chuck snowballs and, giggling, try to linebacker tackle you to the ground. Plastic tents that once breezed through the summer are now comically snowed under. But the tipis, yurts, campers, lean-tos, reappropriated school buses, prefab shacks with porches, and ice-fishing tents are holding strong. We chat; she invites me back to her yurt. Then I get back in my car. I back my car out, and see a woman, panting, in my rear-view mirror. There, Hanes waves at my boots. She has deemed them carelessly lightweight. Inappropriate. She pulls me into a supplies tent and makes sure I swap mine out for a thicker, more trusty pair. She yanks down sleeping bags, tosses me handwarmers, makes sure I have everything I needed to stay toasty and alive for the next few days. Seven months ago, on April 1, on a small sloping plot of private riverbank land, LaDonna Brave Bull Allard officially opened the doors on the first camp, Sacred Stone. But on the way from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to an oil tank farm near Patoka, Illinois, DAPL still had to cross under Lake Oahe, a federally dammed stretch of the Missouri River that abuts the land of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and provides its residents with water. Standing Rock, fearing a leak and aghast at construction that would disrupt their sacred burial grounds, had long objected. Their defense was multi-pronged. First, there was action in federal courts, including a lawsuit brought against the Army Corps of Engineers, the federal agency that oversees pipeline construction on and near waterways. Allard possesses a homegrown regality and electric-purple fingernails. In her Chevy SUV, there are big stems of sage loose on the dashboard and a man in a black jacket with a feather tattoo on his left temple mutely keeping watch out the window in the backseat. To those ends, she wanted to make as much noise as possible. On the first day, there were six tipis and three residents. I remember it was kind of cold. There was still snow on the ground. I ask. She unfolds a slow smile and locks eye contact. From April until July, the camp maxed at 20 people. Grants started to come in from like-minded indigenous groups, and donations started ticking up, too, of clothes and food. Folks from the reservation town of Cannon Ball, a few miles down the road, began to come by with whole cooked meals. Over weeks and months, 20 people became a couple thousand, and major news outlets started paying attention. Mark Ruffalo showed up. So did Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas. Dee Snider shot a music video here. Someone saw a young starlet spending all dinner at the communal kitchen getting reiki. Someone else saw the scion of a political dynasty accidentally getting the port-a-potty door swung open on him, mid-business. In late October, working alongside state police and the North Dakota National Guard, Morton County pushed back, driving activists off a northern sprawl of the community that the activists had named Treaty Stronghold Camp. 141 people were arrested, including Johanna Holy Elk Face, age 64. Then they just started bringing us one by one onto school buses. Then we seen all the buffalo running down the hill towards us. Along with temporary holding pens likened by the arrestees to dog kennels, it painted the incident as a clumsy and dangerous enforcement of power. It was as effective as any call to arms. It fueled more attention, more money, more warm, loud bodies in the camps. In moments like this, you can see how a local sheriff's department can begin, perhaps almost unknowingly, to take small steps toward the language and tactics of international, entrenched power struggles: at times, Israeli authorities have put forth similar reasoning when blocking construction materials from getting to Gaza. The barbed-wired, militarized blockade. The threatened confiscation of basic supplies. Propane can easily be used as a life-endangering flammable. But what the people in the camps would tell you they need propane for is to keep their RVs habitable in freezing nighttime temperatures. And what the folks in Gaza would tell you they need construction material for is to build houses. Clyde Bellecourt Clyde Bellecourt, the co-founder of the American Indian Movement, sits on a crate outside a communal kitchen in Oceti Sakowin. They were a propulsive, combative force. In 1973, they made a symbolic stand by occupying the South Dakota town of Wounded Knee, the site of the 1890 Wounded Knee Massacre, holding off against federal agents for 71 days. Bellecourt himself is nearly as controversial as the movement. (Much like with the Black Panthers, the FBI actively worked to fracture and weaken AIM). At 80, the years have muddled his voice, giving it that soft, wet, grandfatherly tone, as if there is a hard candy being worked on somewhere in the back of his jowls. But even four decades removed from the seminal AIM actions of the 1970s, Bellecourt is still fierce, and quick to rail. A generation or two later, a new breed of activists has come forth. That includes people like Lorna Hanes, and Thomas Tonatiuh Lopez. Thomas Lopez Lopez, a 24-year-old who identifies as Chicano, grew up outside of Denver as the adopted son of Sicangu Lakota parents. And pretty much since birth, he knew about AIM: one of his grandfathers is the AIM luminary Chief Leonard Crow Dog. After graduating from college, Lopez dreamt of hosting his own The View-like entertainment program, one that would feature indigenous and other minority artists. Quickly, he packed up and headed to Standing Rock. At Standing Rock, he became a member of the International Indigenous Youth Council, a solid, self-defined structure within the anarchic sprawl of the camp. And like a lot of people I talk to, Lopez speaks of his experience at Standing Rock as life-altering: he believes that here he has finally tapped into the leadership capabilities he was born with. He says the story of Standing Rock will forever change self-perception in indigenous communities, encourage heretofore unimagined ambitions. But Lopez also has no problem flashing the grand, righteous fire of Bellecourt and his grandfather Crow Dog and his militant AIM forefathers. The corporations should be very scared of us. A native kid in a thermal shirt, boots, and basketball shorts runs to the port-a-potty. Like decolonization. He pauses dramatically, goes to a stage whisper. There are so many veterans, so many of them physically or mentally injured. You end up hearing about a lot of motivations to come out here, not one quite the same as the next. A few weeks ago, his son Clark was killed in a car accident while on his way to Standing Rock. Passing through Wisconsin, the car Clark was traveling in flipped; the driver had jerked the wheel to avoid a deer carcass. Jay and Clark used to text constantly, swapping links and photos. On the day before the election, Jay sent Clark a Times article about lefty doomsday preppers: folks getting ready for the then-unimaginable possibility of a Trump victory. Then he sent his dad his Google maps route from the East Coast out to North Dakota. Clark was a real activist, a real doer. I ask him. Duly committed to privacy, they have their own security checkpoint. The imagery of militarized police facing off with horse-riding indigenous Americans felt grand, and representative of generations of tragedy. So much of the regular coverage of Standing Rock has focused on the ghastly clashes, and understandably so. But the sheer mass of the outpost is the true bulwark. The kitchens, where volunteers chop cactus leaves and gut turkeys and whip out hash, pasta salad, fried bread. The dusk water prayer ceremonies, where people end up teary-eyed and sniveling in the cold. The morning general meetings at the geodesic dome, where issues get passive-aggressively hashed out. It had nothing to do with my mouth. In the trenches. Boom. After meeting. The DAPL standoff tends to lean toward pitched language: there is a lot of talk of missions, of tactical strategy, of battles. If you want to build a pipeline, you need permit approval from the Army Corps of Engineers. With DAPL, Energy Transfer Partners had all rights to expect that things would continue moving smoothly. Then the combination of the action on the land and the action in the courts came forward and left them anchored in place, awaiting an easement from the Corps that would allow them to cross below. Which is: more community boards, more public forums, more courtrooms. And the atmosphere in the camp has the auspicity of opening day. The call was put out a few weeks back by Wes Clark Jr., an ex-Army officer, and the son of decorated general Wesley Clark. All week, talk has revolved around their numbers, and the estimations keep rising. It seems inconceivable that Morton County would be as quick to act aggressively toward former soldiers as they have been against the people of Standing Rock. The temperature is still in the 20s, but the sun has broken through, and the rays are just enough to suggest the first cracks of a yet-long-away spring, as veterans from every major U.S. combat operation since WWII, from Korea to the Balkans to Iraq, meet, and clap each other on their camouflaged-jacketed backs. That morning, there had been no indication that a ruling on the easement decision was imminent. Seemingly out of nowhere, then, word trickled out in the camp: the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had decided not to grant it. Rather than allowing Energy Transfer Partners to cross under Lake Oahe, the Corps would, in fact, be undertaking an Environmental Impact Statement and exploring alternative routes. There are speeches, prayers, thrown-off announcements about rides to Portland or lessons in dog-care responsibilities. There are lots and lots of songs. Now, a rapid-fire string of speakers takes over to bask in the unexpected announcement. Then the spiritual leader of the Sioux, Chief Arvol Looking Horse, comes on the mic. Hanes and LaDuke are together near the front of the huddle, embracing, grinning big, bopping up and down in place. Nearby, a couple of aunties sit with plastic partitioned camp plates of food, not quite bothered enough to pause on the consumption of their noodles. That night, yelps and songs come strong from the Sacred Fire. In the dim light, between the bumpy topography of the hard, well-trod ice and the army tents popping up left and right, the place begins resembling a bustling moon colony. The fight at Standing Rock has been a part of a larger, loosely-connected international campaign that rejects fossil fuels in favor of alternative energy sources. In 2015, plans for the Kinder Morgan pipeline were felled in Massachusetts thanks in part to grassroots efforts. But there are already 2.5 million miles of pipeline in the United States. The network crisscrosses the nation; your home or primary water source lays closer to a pipeline than you think. And despite recent growth in the field, alternative energy is still very much fledgling: in the U.S., solar power delivers about one percent of total electricity. Originally, Energy Transfer Partners had requested a permit for DAPL to go north of Bismarck. They did it because it was the closest thing they could get to maintaining a straight line between the Bakken oil fields and Illinois. At this base level, Energy Transfer Partners is not inherently malicious. What they are is disproportionately powerful. As his choice for Secretary of State, Trump has named Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson. Ultimately, then, Standing Rock is as much about pipeline protests as it is vested power dynamics. The bizarre, possibly unreplicatable confluence of forces that made Standing Rock an international news story had led to this: actual political power. With perilous nights in plummeting temperatures, with voices shredded raw, with hands run ragged, people who were not billionaires or CEOs chipped away actual political power. Soon, just over a month after the rejection of the easement, the President-Elect will assume power and all of it could slip away. But if the President-Elect is a threat to democracy as a whole, then Standing Rock has a been a boon to it in general. Here, in the tundra of North Dakota, a wild sprawl of life has popped up, to teach us the protocols and the potential power of peaceful, asymmetrical warfare. Just 400 miles to the west, in November of 1876, the Lakota Sioux defeated General Custer at Little Bighorn. With it comes skepticism over the good news about the easement. Accordingly, the camp buzz has not ceased. A massive construction shed is a hive of activity, with folks streaming in and out to grab power tools. As the snow piles up, barracks and huts are still rising. Back in the SUV, LaDonna Brave Bull Allard explains that this is the exact the kind of wobbly permanence off of which she hopes to build. And in the summer of 2017, Allard is planning on using those donations to open a full-time ecovillage. People had given up their lives to come here. People had given up their lives to come here. Meanwhile, on Route 1806, the veterans assemble to execute a peaceful march. With bold chants, they vocalize the anthem of the American Indian Movement. One man runs past the front line and drops onto his back to knock out some snow angels. But the barricade is, for once, unmanned. And the only presence on the bridge are the Water Protectors. A woman climbs on an old burnt out Jeep and encourages the people to say it again and again. Later, as I drive out of the camps, the sunset starts off blazingly orange over the expanse of white, then dips with a thin line of pink over the wide, blank hills. Snow swirls come in gusts that resemble solid mass. These are bursts of winds that feel strong enough to topple steel. After hours stuck in blizzard traffic in the dwindling sunlight, I get an opening to power through. I get to Bismarck, where I get drunk with an ex-Marine from New Jersey and chase a false rumor of Ramada Inn blackjack, and then I get home, where there is warmth and, finally, a shower. But before I go, unlikely as it is, I see Lorna Hanes standing in the middle of that one-lane North Dakota road. I stop the car, bracing for a storm of honks behind me. She smiles and, absentmindedly, makes an S with her finger in my snow-covered drivers-side window. The FADER newsletter.

Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, which owns the Dakota Access Pipeline, and Sunoco Logistics released a statement Sunday criticizing the Obama administration's move to halt development. Anny Chen wants Winnipeggers to consider moving their money from big banks into credit unions that aren't invested in the oil and gas sector. RBC said they are lenders to Energy Transfer partners but don't have direct financial involvement in the Dakota Access Pipeline. Chen said banks may not be actively financing the Dakota Access Pipeline in particular, but the fact they have money invested in the fossil fuel industry at all goes against the goals of sustainable energy. Chen asked. Winnipeg educator Leah Gazan said now that construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline has been suspended, it's time for Canadian Indigenous land and water protectors to turn their attention to the pipelines approved recently by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Many protesters remain committed to staying at the Dakota Access Pipeline construction side through the winter.

Introduction by Joe Spring. The entire march had stopped on the bridge separating the Standing Rock march from the Dakota Access Pipeline. It was like Moses parting the seas; everyone split the line open. Nevins was on a flight six hours later from Boston. Some of the people with him at Pine Ridge wanted to go to Standing Rock to be water protectors. He invited Nevins to join them because the photographer has worked with him on past projects, most notably in Nicaragua. Both men were present when news moved through the camp that the Army Corps of Engineers would look for an alternative route to the pipeline, instead of drilling near the camp and under the Missouri River. He says that people also realized that the forces behind the Dakota Access Pipeline might just wait until Trump is in office to move forward, and that they are resolved to protest until the end. His photos capture a march that took place after the announcement was made. It brought me to tears. Sign up for daily updates from Sierra magazine. Something went wrong.

In spite of how shadowy the firm may sound, TigerSwan has the approval of the United States government.

The Morton County Sheriff's Department estimated 400 protesters sought to cross the bridge on state Highway 1806. Protesters say they started fires in order to keep warm in -4 C weather. A statement from the local sheriff said demonstrators were trying to outflank and 'attack' law enforcement barricades. The sheriff's department said in a statement around 1 a.m. Monday that approximately 100 to 200 protesters were on the bridge or in the vicinity. 'Just got shot in the hand and back with rubber bullets. Tear gas, sound canon, flash bangs, and water canon,' protester Aidoneus Bishop wrote on Facebook, where he posted this photo. Supporter Leland Brenholt said at least four people suffered wounds from rubber bullets. He said other protesters were hit with canisters in the chest and legs. One protester showed his swollen hand on social media and said he was among those struck by rubber bullets. Dallas Goldtooth with the Indigenous Environmental Network said at least 17 people were taken to hospitals. At least one person was arrested. Protesters said a gym in Cannon Ball was opened to aid demonstrators who were soaked and exposed to chemical irritants. Rema Loeb told The Associated Press he was forced to retreat from the bridge because he feared being doused with water on the freezing night. Others, he said, needed medical treatment after being hit with tear gas.

On Friday, Kelcy Warren, the chief executive of Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners, said the company is unwilling to reroute the pipeline.

More than half of the pipeline has been constructed, but since December 2017, construction was halted at two points along its route, Cuautepec and San Pablito, due to legal rulings. However, the Regional Council is re-invigorating indigenous forms of governance. While the communities partake in indigenous forms of governance, they did follow the 2018 political campaign closely. Montes Lazcano says that organizing the Regional Council has empowered people to think critically about the political situation.

As I approached a camp and saw all the tipis, all the individuals brought together as defenders of water, I found myself pushing back tears. Ranging in age from infants to elders, people had traveled from all over the country and the world to stand in solidarity with the protesters. Then we would all gather in a circle and pray as the sun rose. Our prayers would be for those who opposed us, those who supported us from afar and those who were among us. These prayers continued all day and all night in many forms. It was truly a wonderful place to be. When I left the camp after a month, I wept again. This time, I felt like I was walking away from my family in their moment of dire need as the police kept pushing towards our sacred site. Here are some of the portraits I took while in Standing Rock. The heartbeat of the people Benjamin Conrad and Willard Price sing and drum by the side of the Cannonball River at the Oceti Sakowin camp. At night, Will would sit, sing and drum, and people would emerge from the dark to join him before disappearing into the starry night. Caro is committed to staying at Standing Rock for as long as it takes to stop the pipeline. Here, she kneels in prayer before the police. A sage protest A protester smudges the air with sage, an act of purification that helps clear negative energy from a place. This sacred tradition is one of the daily peaceful practices at all the Standing Rock camps and on the front lines of the protest. Standing up for those no longer here James Wyatt Hawk, a Cherokee two spirit, came to Standing Rock for his late grandmother. He says he knows that if she were still alive, she would have been there.

An eagle staff is passed from generation and generation, accumulating the medicine, or energy, of those who have carried it and the brave acts it has witnessed. To have a staff at Standing Rock brings its medicine to the area as a form of protection and honor. Wes traveled to the protests from Santa Fe, New Mexico, with his son so that they could show their dedication to protecting the lands and livelihood for all indigenous peoples.

I have spent a lot of time listening here - to people who have probably spent a lot of their lives being ignored. I have heard talk of revolutions, of dual citizenship, of black snakes and of the process of making entire communities invisible. At the camp, our group of students was able to go through an orientation designed for non-Natives. Whiteness is about more than skin color. Those privileged by whiteness tend to feel that they belong everywhere or that they deserve to know things. While these beliefs are oftentimes unconscious, it is important to confront the assumptions behind them because we do not belong everywhere, and sometimes we do not need to know. This fight is not about white people, nor is it fodder for NGOs to advance their cause. It is about real people who have spent hundreds of years doing exactly what they are doing now. This movement is part of a deliberate and determined process, and is guided by the seven principles of the Lakota people: prayer, respect, honesty, compassion, wisdom, generosity and humility. Following these principles, the Oceti Sakowin camp is a place of prayer and ceremony (two things with which I am not very familiar). The NoDAPL movement is being advanced in ways that you or I may not entirely understand, but it is incredibly important to recognize that this is okay. As I write this I consider the reality of a Trump presidency. But this is about more than a pipeline. It is about human rights and dignity, and the fact that Native people deserve access to clean water simply because they are human beings, and not because they are part of a larger discussion about environmentalism or climate justice. It is also about halting the erasure of Natives by non-Natives that has been ongoing for far too long. Nations exist inside this space, and only through the pursuit of understanding and connections can the rights of all humans and all nations be given the respect they deserve.

Standing Rock was only beginning to get national media coverage at that point, and the story of our UU kin showing up in such a faithful, prophetic way inspired all of us in Minnesota. Shortly following that Convening Call, Rev. Van Fossan and I spoke again about what a broader, nation-wide UU response to Standing Rock might look like--and how we, as a religious people, might better support the congregation in sustaining their faithful support of the Water Protectors as representatives of our entire faith. More conversations followed, with representatives from the UUA, MidAmerica Region, Standing on the Side of Love, the UU College of Social Justice, and others. As a result of these collaborations, a broad network of UUs from a wide variety of our organizations and congregations mobilized a nimble, accountable rapid response to directly support the Bismarck congregation, and the Water Protectors. Together, by leveraging our relationships and our institutional resources, we supported hundreds of Unitarian Universalist clergy and lay people traveling to North Dakota to attend nationwide calls for physical presence at the camps. And when the needs shifted and the weather changed, we created the Ministry in Residence Program, sending a series of Unitarian Universalist clergypeople for a week at a time to be with Rev. Van Fossan and the UUs in Bismarck, adding to their capacity and representing our solidarity in an embodied way. This work of solidarity continues. The seventh Minister in Residence arrives in Bismarck this week. These clergy people, who have come from all over the country, and have volunteered their service without compensation, have been critical to supporting our congregation there in sustaining their direct solidarity work with the Water Protectors. I left resolved to do what I can to protect our most targeted communities and our most vulnerable activists. My family concurred. While there I made over 60 calls to people asking them to help clean up the camp. I helped hang pictures, bulletin boards and organized. I created flyers, attended the UU women's lunch, and an interfaith meeting to plan a training on multicultural competencies. Everywhere I went, I was a visual reminder that this small congregation was not alone in standing for Standing Rock, though they are the only church to do so in the state. On Wednesday, I joined Karen Van Fossan, the congregation's minister at a bond hearing for a water protector who had been in jail since his arrest in September. We both wore our ministerial collars as a visible reminder that standing up for Standing Rock is a moral issue. The water protector was released because Karen and the congregation found him a local place to live with a couple who agreed to be his sponsor while he awaits his trial. Tears of joy and gratitude flowed among his family and advocates. You too were there in spirit for your support of this program enables the ongoing spiritual nurturance and care for Karen and her congregation who may otherwise feel isolated and alone in this important ministry. Thank you for making this ministry possible. - Jill Cowie, minister in residence We are grateful to all the congregations and organizations who have blessed their ministers to go and serve in this way. And we are also indebted to the UUA, MUUSJA, Standing on the Side of Love, MidAmerica Region, the UUSC, and the UUCSJ, each of which has donated sign ificant staff time and infrastructural support to our solidarity efforts. But now, beloveds, it is the responsibility of our broader faith to support the ongoing Ministry in Residence program at the UUFCBM. Our UU siblings in Bismarck have told us that this ministry is a crucial part of their ability to keep doing solidarity work on behalf of our broader faith, and they have asked us to ensure that it continues as long as it is needed. Several of the camps have been forcibly evacuated since Wednesday, and Water Protectors have been arrested en masse. New camps are being built farther away from the river. The legal and spiritual battle is far from over, and our Unitarian Universalist siblings in Bismarck have committed to working in solidarity with the Water Protectors until the fight has been won. Our collective Unitarian Universalist response to Standing Rock is exactly the kind of ongoing, multivalent, nimble response to social, environmental, and spiritual crisis is exactly what will be required of Unitarian Universalists in the coming months and years. And as you do, will you also make a donation to the Women's Council - a grassroots organization that relies solely on public support and primarily assists women, children and elders. Your support will assist with rooms, gas cards, and bus tickets to evacuate remaining people from camp. Our UU congregation in Augusta, Maine commissioned their minister Rev.

I lay among friends, huddled and cold in our sleeping bags. We listened to the lashing wind and the drums and prayer chants coming from the sacred fire, and we reflected on why we, four Iraq War veterans, were here. Police floodlights shone from the drill site of the Dakota Access Pipeline, scheduled to cross under the Missouri River, the water source for millions of people. Members of the Standing Rock Sioux, concerned not only about polluted water but also the desecration of sacred sites, began resisting the pipeline in 2014. In mid-2016, finally, these water protectors gained major support. Over 200 tribal nations pledged solidarity. Thousands of non-natives traveled to North Dakota to stand on the front lines. There, I rode my bicycle on trails crossing abandoned strip mines. Bulldozers had left precarious shale formations and streams ran orange with iron runoff. When a sanitation corporation threatened to open a landfill at a reclaimed mine near homes in our community, residents finally resisted. My grandfathers both served, along with several uncles. Back home, the military is sacrosanct. My job as a radar operator, like so many military specializations, got privatized, so I found myself tasked out for other duties. I guarded poor Iraqis while they filled thousands of sandbags for the contractor Kellogg, Brown, and Root, only to see those sandbags rot in the sun as they sat unused. There, instead of helping military contractors make money, I felt like I was finally serving the people. While we were there, on December 4, the Army Corps of Engineers finally denied the pipeline company its permit to drill under the river. Police pulled back, and the water protectors celebrated. The indigenous community had worked months for this ruling. They sacrificed the most. But I like to think the result was also influenced by the prospect of police tear-gassing and firing rubber bullets at unarmed veterans. A ceremony followed where Wesley Clark Jr., key organizer of the Veterans Stand for Standing Rock campaign, offered an apology to Native Americans on behalf of the military, citing decades of broken treaties and violence. Five hundred of us went to our knees. I hope to participate in a forgiveness ceremony one day in Iraq, in the spirit of Standing Rock.

What has emerged through this experience has shed light on the injustice embedded within state development policy. The fight for our water is tied to the fight for protecting all that is sacred. Protecting ancient burials, sacred sites help us protect our water. Standing up to Indian mascots, offensive logos and cultural appropriation helps us to fight against exploitative projects. All of these themes are present right here in Texas. There is still much to be done. Natives stand against the mine because it threatens to pollute the Rio Grande River, which affects thousands of people. At the time, the corporation running the mine, North American Coal Company (NACC), denied the presence of any burials. It is common for archaic burials to be found in large numbers and while we are now in possession of evidence of at least one burial, we are suspicious of the authorities in granting us our rightful information for the remainder of the site. The dishonesty by Dos Republicas, NACC, the Texas state authorities and the USACE have operated in unison to deny the rights of the Native peoples of Texas to free and fair consultation. To our knowledge, there has been no further testing or excavation since the time of this report. However, there has been a commencement of mining in the area. Desecration of sacred sites is not unique to Eagle Pass, unfortunately as has been uncovered recently with two pipelines currently under construction in West Texas. The Trans Pecos Pipeline (TPPL) and Comanche Trails Pipeline are both owned by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) the company behind DAPL, and they threaten some of the most historic places for Natives in Texas. According to local news source, The Van Horn Advocate: The TPPL will cut a 143 mile-swath through the last vestige of wilderness in Texas desecrating as many as one ancient Native American site per square mile of its path. The Trap Springs archeological site, a very recent and significant find is in imminent danger of being bulldozed despite evidence of at least 5,000 years of occupation and a pending nomination as a State Archeological Landmark. Further west, Comanche Trail Pipeline cuts through Hueco Tanks, possibly the most remarkable archeological site in Texas. Hundreds of pictographs and thousands of artifacts including pottery and burial sites cover the Hueco Tanks state park and surrounding area. This land has been used for ongoing ceremony for a diverse array of indigenous peoples including the Mescalero Apache, Kiowa, Tigua, Comanche and Xicanxs of El Paso. Exports are driving the current expansion of oil and gas infrastructure throughout South Texas. Much of this fracking boon connects at three proposed liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals in South Padre Island. The Garcia Pasture site contains an indigenous cemetery, an ancient village and numerous nomadic artifacts, all threatened along with the beach, the bay and the local economy. All of this destruction and the gross disrespect paid to the sacred nature of burial grounds, life-giving sources of water or cultural and historic remains may come as a surprise. When we look deeper, we find that there is no mistake being made by the companies and no benefit of the doubt to give them. Their disrespect is calculated, and deep. Reminiscent of the infamous Washington Football team logo, this logo carries more negative implications than mere cultural appropriation. They have been used at various times in the colonial period and in later U.S. history to designate a place where whole bodies, heads and later scalps of Indian people (men, women and children) could be brought in for bounty payment. The bounty practice is one reason why many American Indian people are so opposed to the use of these logos. We can add mining company to the list of things that should not be by signified by a severed Indian head; and we can add to this narrative the aspect of grave robbery and bounty payment. Theft of Native land is a trophy for settler colonial society as it symbolizes domination over the land and native peoples. The present case at Dos Republicas brings these themes together, as land, bodies and images are all taken from native peoples in a single act of destruction. Recently Apache Corporation has acquired vast oil reserves, which threaten sacred Apache sites, including Balmorhea in West Texas. ETP also share a corporate headquarters with Chief Oil and Gas, another severed head oil company. It is no accident that these companies overlay multiple expressions of anti-Indianness. However, focusing on the details of the procedure misses the reality of how state processes generally work and why and how they are so racist. The consultation process is already overwhelmingly pro-extractive capitalism and consistently and publicly admits to hold an abstract economic benefit over the wellbeing of land and people. Said process is even less likely to recognize or respect Indigenous land, culture or life. The consultation process, or lack there of, is a continuation of a colonial relationship between the settler state and Native peoples. The destructive development in Eagle Pass, West Texas and North Dakota demonstrates how colonial society justifies its own expansion by devaluing indigenous land and culture. State parks such as Hueco Tanks and Big Bend are unlikely to remain protected while Kelcy Warren, ETP CEO, sits on the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission. The government is not on our side. It took great sacrifice to earn a victory in North Dakota, and even this win is tenuous. It will be up to the people to come together to defend our water for future generations. The Army Corp of Engineers told them to stop months ago and they ripped up burial grounds anyway. DAPL is expected to continue despite the lack of easement. They will pay fines after they are through destroying the land and river. No big deal to them. Standing Rock is not standing down. The only reason this came today is because over 5,000 veterans are due to show up by tomorrow. This fight is not over and even if it was in North Dakota, there is a whole nation out there that is dealing with pipeline ruptures.

We have to face up to this life; there's no alternative: we have to fight for what is ours. Eliseu Lopes In November 2011, masked gunmen appeared at a camp set up by around 60 indigenous people in Guayviry, close to Brazil's border with Paraguay. According to news reports, there were up to 40 gunmen. They ordered the camp dwellers to lie face down on the ground and, when some resisted, they opened fire. Many of the Guarani escaped into the surrounding forest; some were wounded and others were reportedly kidnapped. But it was clear that the gunmen had come with a specific target in mind. Multiple witnesses saw the masked men shoot Gomes in the head, chest, arms and legs before carrying away his body (which has never been recovered). Eliseu Lopes, also a Guarani leader and today Brazil's best-known campaigner for indigenous people's rights, has been actively campaigning for indigenous land rights (and thereby risking his life) since 2003, when he went to work as a teacher in the indigenous village of Taquapiri, Mato Grosso do Sul. After Gomes' murder, Lopes and other Guarani leaders organised a campaign to bring the guilty to justice. Nineteen men were eventually charged in relation to the murder but, of the seven jailed in 2012, none served more than two years. Today, the only man convicted and still detained is Aurelino Arce, a retired military police officer and owner of the private security business for which many of the gunmen worked. He is kept under house arrest. Fifteen indigenous leaders were killed... police investigations led nowhere... Around 100 years ago, the Brazilian government took their lands and handed them to ranchers and farmers for development. The indigenous people were placed on reservations - often the poorest, least productive land. Nowadays, the Guarani find themselves crammed into small patches of land like Dourados, a stretch measuring 12 square miles and home to more than 12,000 people. The lack of space and services leads to poor health and malnutrition. And it's not just the Guaranis' physical health that suffers. Having to live in these conditions, risking violence from local ranchers and seeing family members shot places an extraordinary strain on their mental health. As a result, the Guarani have the highest suicide rate in the world. Children as young as nine have taken their own lives. The Guarani people face an uphill battle for justice, land and better living conditions. They organise protests and bring legal cases to local courts, where, due to the enormous influence of rich landowners, they invariably lose. Since 2007, Lopes has been the spokesman for the Aty Guasu Movement, an organisation that fights for the recuperation of the Guaranis' ancestral lands; he is also a leading figure on the Board of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil. Every month I had to relocate to another village. This contributed to the breakdown of my marriage.... It's a difficult, frightening situation because we have nowhere to run to.

We challenge the labor movement to strategize on how to better engage and include Native people and other marginalized populations into the labor movement as a whole.

A Lakota Sioux and her 5-year-old son pose for a photo at a protest camp erected to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Case, for instance, traveled quite a long way to the Peace Garden State: she is from the sunny shores of Hawaii, not rugged North Dakota, and she claims a Native Hawaiian identity, not a Native American one. The diverse constellation of Native theologies articulated at Standing Rock and other indigenous protest camps champions the reverse: they seek to protect land, water, and other natural resources from further human development, precisely because they are deemed sacred by indigenous people. And this year, after centuries of struggle, their prayers are starting to be answered. Beginning with just a few tents sprinkled across a barren field earlier this year, protesters now say nearly 10,000 people have visited the thriving camps, with guests hailing from as many as 300 different indigenous tribes. Expressions of solidarity between indigenous groups may sound predictable, but the history of Native American activism is pockmarked with internal squabbles. Early attempts to unify indigenous causes in the United States, such as the creation of the American Indian Movement in the 1960s, have since been marred by controversy and factionalism. Native Hawaiians once avoided connections between their cause and that of Native Americans, lest they suffer the same humiliating defeats as those in the continental United States. In Arizona, members of the Apache nation began occupying an area known as Oak Flat, vowing to fend off the proposed development of a copper mine on land they call holy. And when environmentalists pushed back against the creation of the Keystone XL pipeline, organizations such as the Cowboy and Indian Alliance bolstered the existing climate change movement with Native activists in both Canada and the United States. A Native American prayer stick is held near the capital during a Keystone XL protest in 2014. Meanwhile, something new happened: social media allowed indigenous people across the country to show support for their fellow activists with a few simple clicks, adding hashtags and memes to their own Facebook and Twitter profiles. The digital connections helped elevate their respective causes, but also forged real-world relationships between activists in different tribes. By the time Standing Rock rolled around, a spiritual network of indigenous people was already in full effect. Years later, Case returned the favor by assisting Sisk in her effort to restore California waterways once frequented by millions of local salmon. Virtually all of the protests she has attended, she said, featured some form of prayer or sacred ritual. Native protestors rally on Capitol Hill in 2015 to stop the construction of a copper mine in Oak Flat, Arizona. All of the activists ThinkProgress interviewed insisted they spoke only for themselves when discussing faith, explaining that each tribe harbors its own unique spiritual traditions, practices, and customs forged over the course of centuries, if not millennia. Religion has long been a part of Native American protest movements, as has its connection to the environmentalist struggle. He noted that Native Hawaiian schoolchildren are already singing songs written in the protest camps of Mauna Kea just a year before. While this groundswell of religious generation is rooted in old traditions, it sometimes reawakens ancient elements that can challenge elders. Although traditionally celebrated in many tribes, two-spirit people have not always been welcomed by modern indigenous people. The Hawaii case is similarly rooted in disputes over sacred land, although the lawsuit currently focuses on state laws, not the federal statutes. But according to Johnson, an expert on sacred land disputes, the law is often not enough to guarantee indigenous groups a win. Indeed, the movement thus far has largely been sustained through protest and agitation. Slowly accruing support and attention over time, and leaning on sacred claims, activists whittle away the patience of corporations and government officials until they (ideally) give up. In Hawaii, construction of the TMT is currently stalled while lawyers debate aspects of the construction process, prompting The Hawaii Island New Knowledge fund to begin investigating alternative sites. In March, the Obama administration moved to place Oak Flat on the National Register of Historic Places, adding another bureaucratic hoop preventing the Resolution Copper company from installing a mine on site. The Lummi Nation in Washington State successfully defeated an effort to build the largest coal port ever in North America near their land earlier this year, and Native groups are also credited with helping stop the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015. And in addition to their secular allies in the climate movement, indigenous groups are also attracting partners in non-Native faith traditions. Representatives from the Presbyterian Church (USA), United Church of Christ, Episcopal Church, and the United Methodist Church have all visited the Standing Rock camp or expressed solidarity with the protesters, as has the Nation of Islam, according to the Religion News Service.

The Sioux peoples signed treaties in 1851 and 1868. The government broke them before the ink was dry. When the Army Corps of Engineers dammed the Missouri River in 1958, it took our riverfront forests, fruit orchards and most fertile farmland to create Lake Oahe. The fields in North Dakota have been increasingly targeted for Bakken shale oil resources over the past years and they are quite familiar with public controversy: many of us remember the proposal of the infamous Keystone XL pipeline from 2008-2015, which was held in starkly low public opinion and struck down twice by the Obama administration. The proposed Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) is not so different from its failed counterpart. It is mapped out for the same length of 1,172 miles as the Keystone XL and is targeting the same Bakken shale reserves for carry across the upper Midwest. Parent company, Energy Transfer Partners is selling the pipeline as an economic booster, job creator, and sure investment for the future of the American people. In the hills outside of Bismarck, North Dakota is the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, sitting along the banks of the Cannonball River, a tributary to the Missouri River. The pipeline construction sites can now be seen from the reservation, but many people here saw the pipeline coming before it even arrived. Just as Energy Transfer Partners and TransCanada failed to consult Native Tribes who live along the planned pipeline route and whose sacred lands, ancestral lands, and main water sources will be compromised by construction, there has not been a single tribal consultation around the proposed DAPL. Oceti Sakowin Camp in the rain (Photo: Nadya Tannous) On April 1st , Sacred Stone Spirit Camp was erected on the bank of the Cannonball as a residence for water protectors, many whom came from within and off the reservation to stand against pipeline construction, call for water preservation, and call for recognition of the Federal treaties held with the Great Sioux Nation. What started out as a few hundred people quickly increased into the thousands, stemming the creation of the Oceti Sakowin and Red Warrior Camps on the other side of the Cannonball. Protectors, support, and solidarity with Standing Rock are arriving from all edges of the world, many of them representing Indigenous Nations. My own caravan set out from California the 2nd week of September, preceding the Palestinian Youth Movement-USA Caravan that arrived soon after. As a contingent of Indigenous peoples in diaspora and recent settlers on Turtle Island, we attest that those standing at Standing Rock are standing for our present and future as well. We must in turn stand for each other against the present, future, and historical supremacies of erasure, the active legacy of settler-colonialism, and the viciousness of greed. Other attendees posted photos of a crop dusting plane releasing a gas or chemical over the crowd. There has been little clarity thereafter of the makeup of the compound or the purpose of the spray. Plane with gas flies over protectors and construction site (Photo: Rob Wilson Photography) The participation and planning of direct actions against DAPL construction, however, are continuing, with over 100 cars caravanning out to 5 construction sites the week of October 3rd and successfully halting construction for the day. Indeed my own caravan coming from California was discouraged from approaching the reservation on the main road running from Bismarck, ND due to the checkpoints erected by North Dakota authorities. Democracy Now, The New York Times, Huffington Post, and many independent news sources also reported these same tactics. Because somewhere in the awkward power dynamic of being a US citizen, a non-native inhabitant of Turtle Island, and a Palestinian in the Diaspora, I saw the struggle for livelihood and culture, the struggle against settler-colonialism, the struggle to protect the sacred and maintain your own legitimacy, and the ever ominous force of erasure and historical amnesia. Movement leaders at Sacred Stone Spirit Camp have repeatedly stated that the gatherings of different Indigenous Nations near Cannonball, ND is the largest in the past 150 years on the North American continent. The council fire sits at the mouth of the main entrance of Oceti Sakowin Camp, outlined by rows of flags representing many of the Indigenous Nations who have come to stand with Standing Rock. At the end of one of the rows is the Palestinian flag. Seeing it filled me equally with joy and sadness because it confirmed two things that I had pondered throughout the long drive from California to North Dakota: the first thought is that the power of collective resistance against greed and settler-colonialism is a mighty force. That thought was embodied by my joy to see a representation of will by the presently unseen Palestinian siblings who had come to take a stand against destructive powers. Water is life for all of us. Since the arrival of settlers on Turtle Island, First Nations have resisted genocide and displacement. From seizure of land to reservations, from boarding schools to massacres, the state has done everything in its power to erase and eradicate First Nation peoples. Yet, they are still with us today and they continue to resist. Protecting their land, people, and future generations from the DAPL is a testament to their strength and resilience. Palestinian flag waving in the wind (Photo: Nadya Tannous) The comparisons are uncanny. I had spent most of the hours on the road to North Dakota contemplating the connections between the obstacles and oppressions facing those in Standing Rock and the obstacles and oppressions facing we Palestinians under occupation and apartheid. However, upon arriving at Standing Rock, I no longer just thought about the similarities, I felt them in my bones. When protectors at Standing Rock asked me about what Palestinians experience in our own fight against settler-colonialism, oppression, and greed, I answered sometimes through the language of statistics. Yet, more often, I told them narratives of genocide, exile, delegimitzation, broken promises, and resounding resilience. Palestinians stand with standing rock (Photo: FOSNA Solidarity Statement) Sitting around a fire, burning sage and cedar wood, Darlene Meguinis of the Blackfoot Nation in Canada reflected on the beginnings of the Idle No More movement, in which she is still an active organizer. She reminded me that the founders of Idle No More, elders Nina Waste, Jessica Gordon, Sheelah Mcleen, and Sylvia McAdams, had rooted the movement in ceremony. The result of doing so, Meguinis maintained, was to center the focus of the collective actions for change. Upside-down flag flies over Oceti Sakowin (Photo: Nadya Tannous) Intention and prayer surrounded much of the daily camp life and easily dispersed the tensions outside, even as the DAPL Company and National Guard helicopters flew low over the camps each morning, afternoon and night (something that pointedly reminded me of life in Palestine). One of the organizers was Albuquerque artist Monty Singer, whose picture is shown below. Monty Singer, artist from Albuquerque, New Mexico, paints by the Cannonball River (Photo: Nadya Tannous) The time set out to create art and music, to gather around fires and drum circles, to participate in prayer and ceremony with each other uplifted the vibrant energy of the camps and the people within them. Hundreds of people ebbed and flowed into the camps every single day. Oceti Sakowin flags of represented nations (Photo: Nadya Tannous) The sheer power required to uphold the movement is sobering: in light of the failed injunction by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe against the US Army Corps of Engineers at the lower court level, a Federal Appeals court officially halted construction of the pipeline, underlining the same temporary hold parameters as the decree proposed on September 9th by the Department of Justice (DOJ). That hold applies solely within 20 miles on either side of Lake Oahe near the Missouri River. Other locations on the planned pipeline route are still open for construction and, though direct actions at sites of DAPL construction have not wavered, they are increasingly receiving less and less media attention with increasingly severe charges being applied to protectors. Some of those arrested were even extradited back to their home states to face their charges from North Dakota in addition to preexisting protest charges in other states. I asked her why I had met so few non-natives from the local area at Standing Rock. She and a few others from Bismarck came to the camps because they saw past the media pressure. In Geneva, on September 20th, Dave Archambault II, Chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, urged the UN Human Rights Council to stand with the tribe in opposing the DAPL project and advocate for the recognition of their sovereign rights, including the protection of water and sacred places. Martina Looking Horse, a longtime writer from Cheyenne River Reservation, has been camping at Standing Rock for over a month. She told me that she and her family plan to stay until the pipeline is defeated but stressed that the conditions at camp are not easy to live under. The torrential rainstorms, the swings of hot and cold, and the impending North Dakota winter discourage many from staying longer than a few weeks. Yet, Looking Horse affirmed her belief that she and many others will carry on, with or without the support of mainstream media. The hope, she reaffirmed, is that the national and international people of conscience will continue to support in all the ways that they can, hold the US government accountable to their promises, and not forget that the protectors are still there taking a stand. They also read our statement at the tribal council fire and met many people, as I had, who stated how glad they were to see Palestinians supporting the front lines against movement suppression. The solidarity with Palestine for all of us who participated in caravans from PYM was overwhelming. What was supposed to be a few-day trip was extended into a week. PYM Caravan at Standing Rock (Photo: Awad Yasin) Inspired by the stories, the people, the call to our moral responsibility to protect each other and the water that keeps us alive, we hope to return back to Standing Rock and bring supplies for winter. As the Israeli occupation continues, Palestinian land is stolen, ancient olive trees are uprooted, and blood is shed, your struggle inspires our work and we redouble our efforts to witness and nonviolently resist. The light of hope in Standing Rock is not fizzling out. (Photo: Nadya Tannous) Dignidad Rebelde woodblock print at the Oakland Art Build for Standing Rock. (Photo: Nadya Tannous) I remember thinking as I left Standing Rock to return to California: peoples suppressed by power and greed have strength when they rise together. There is a poignant uniting force through something as important as the world that sustains us. The river was quiet when I left, with lots of green and tall grass on its banks. The river flats lay muddy and fertile, the slow current reflecting the sky day and night, the water turning pink and orange by sunset. We need to be building sustainable infrastructure for the future, not destructive unsustainable industries that hurt land, that hurt water, that hurt people.

Breaking News On the Palestinian Solidarity front on College campuses: Portland State University Student Body Senate Votes to Sanction Israel: calls for PSU to break ties with companies doing business with Apartheid Israel in support of Palestine. Portland (Or) The PSU student body association voted 24 to 2 to call on Portland State University to divest from four companies directly involved with Israeli occupation of Palestine. The companies: Hewlett Packard, Dyncorp., G4S, and Caterpillar all implicated in human rights abuses against Palestinians in occupied Palestine. In a dramatic vote on October 24th 2016 in Smith Center a packed room filled with supporters and opponents of the resolution condemning Israel, the Student Body Senate overwhelmingly voted for the resolution calling for divestment from companies participating in human rights abuses in Palestine. The vote was the third time before the PSU student body Senate, and faced opposition from organized Jewish groups as well as from the President of PSU Wem Weeval. The students persevered and clearly the majority was behind the measure. Key student leadership came from Palestinian Students at PSU whom brought authenticity and urgency to the vote. The struggle now is to promote this key step to empower other student bodies across the country to take similar measures to support Palestinian Liberation against a brutal, illegal occupation.

The Dakota Access Pipeline Protest began with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe fighting to protect their clean water, as on July 25 the DAPL was granted authorization to cross Lake Oahe. Now, however it has drawn attention from all over the country and around the globe. Xochitl Lerma, an 18-year-old high school student from Sonoma, Calif., came down to the protest with her mother. This is not to be destroyed. This is our land. Lerma plans to go home and come back with her brother and stay for as long as possible. The camps are being winterized as the protestors plan on sticking it out indefinitely. They have donations of wood coming into the camp from other tribes and have staggered wood chopping stations throughout the camps. They have asked for donations of winter clothes and they are building a school for the children in the camps. There are signs up all over the camp reminding protestors that it is a peaceful protest. There are also legal aides warning people who exit the camp that they could be arrested. Kubala still has the marks on his wrists from the zip ties and the other injuries he acquired from the officials. On Oct. 27, he decided to go to the north camp.

Although this happened two-weeks ago, Kubala still has the marks on his wrists from the zip ties and the other injuries he acquired from the officials.

It is unclear how and when those protesters will be removed. 2:54 p.m. PST: One water protector, Eric Poemz, was streaming live video of the faceoff with police.

Those who remained in camp are worried about police brutality. 12:36 p.m. PST: Law enforcement has not yet forced the evacuation of Oceti Sakowin Camp, but officers have told the remaining water protectors to leave immediately or risk arrest.

PST: There is now less than one hour left until the 2 p.m. MST deadline for water protectors to clear out of Oceti Sakowin Camp. Chanting and praying, a large crowd slowly makes its way out of camp.

Their elders liked to talk about them as the future, but no one seemed to pay much attention to how their lives were hard, bordering on hopeless. Cheyenne River kids had families struggling with poverty and parents and relatives with serious drug-abuse problems. Often there was violence at home, to the point that many youths had nowhere safe to go at night. And amid all this, there was a hard-edged social pressure to drink or use drugs. Charger had seen all of this. But her mother called her in as a runaway one too many times, and the South Dakota Division of Child Protection Services took both girls, sending them to group homes on opposite sides of the state. She got so depressed she was moved to a psychiatric unit, where she often got into fights. She aged out of the system at 17, but when she returned to the ranch developments and trailer parks of Eagle Butte, she struggled with depression. She fell into a monthslong cocaine binge, crashing in abandoned cars with other homeless kids. Her weight had dropped to 80 pounds by the time that her cousin, Joseph White Eyes, intervened. In early 2015 she moved to Portland, as far away as she could get. Together with White Eyes and their friend, Trenton Casillas-Bakeberg, she formed a youth group. They raised money for basketball tournaments and for a youth trip to the Red Nation Film Festival in California, where the kids were able to see the ocean for the first time in their landlocked lives. They went to the tribal council, demanding and getting funds for a safe house for young people. Most of all they counseled young people, urging them to look out for one another and get involved. As the suicide wave crested and broke, the youth group, now called the One Mind Youth Movement, turned to something more political. They spent that fall as part of the local campaign against the Keystone XL pipeline, whose route would cut under the Cheyenne River just upstream from the reservation that bears its name. And after the Obama State Department denied the Keystone XL permission to cross the U.S.-Canadian border in November 2015, they moved their focus to the neighboring Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where the company Energy Transfer Partners was trying to build the Dakota Access Pipeline. That pipeline would move half a million barrels of oil a day beneath the Missouri River, the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux, which is one of the cousin bands to Cheyenne River, as well as for other downstream Sioux reservations. The youths came to believe that the Dakota pipeline was not only a threat to their drinking water but also a harbinger of the larger environmental crisis their generation was set to inherit. Over the next six months that camp grew into an improbable movement that united conservative farmers with the old radicals of the American Indian Movement; urban environmentalists with the traditional chiefs of hundreds of tribes. As Donald Trump pushes forward with the Keystone XL and Dakota Access, he will face a movement emboldened by a victory on Dec. 4, 2016, when the Department of the Army denied an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline and directed the Army Corps to consider an alternate route. It was a rare triumph for both the environmental and land rights movements, as well as for the American left in an otherwise dark moment. But little remarked upon at the time was the unlikely seed from which the movement had grown: an anti-suicide campaign among a tight-knit group of youths, most younger than 25, impelled by tragedy and guided by prophecy. At the start, the camp seemed like a quixotic undertaking. One Mind Youth made the two-hour drive north to propose setting up a prayer camp modeled on the ones raised against the Keystone XL. The tribal council agreed to set up the camp but offered little other support, pessimistic about the effort. The youths were undeterred. In early April, a handful, joined by a few former Keystone activists, moved into tepees in a protected ravine beside the Cannonball River, on the extreme north end of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Those days, the temperatures were in the 30s and there was still snow on the ground. The youths dubbed the camp Sacred Stone and lit the sacred fire. At first, they lived on little more than bologna sandwiches, potato chips and water. But then residents from the small reservation town of Cannon Ball, up the hill from Sacred Stone, began to bring donations: leftovers from dinner, cut-up wooden corrals for the campfires, a chain saw. Photo Jasilyn Charger in Washington. The previous fall, they rented a hotel room in Eagle Butte as an informal crash house for Cheyenne River youth, where sometimes as many as 20 teenagers stayed, sleeping and showering, safe from bullying or the lure of alcohol or drugs. The prayer camp at Standing Rock provided something similar. Members of One Mind would drive home every week to resupply and pick up youths who wanted to experience the camp. For Charger and other leaders, as important as the idea of the safe space was the idea that activism would teach children the skills to survive more immediate threats, like bullying and drug abuse. They hoped to pass on skills at the camp that they themselves had been taught by Keystone activists in their community. Every direct-action training against the Keystone XL, for example, referenced the prophecy of the black snake, a figure out of Lakota myth that in recent times has been identified with pipelines. The message was clear: The struggle against the pipeline was part of the same struggle against alcoholism, suicide and abuse. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After weeks at the Standing Rock camp with minimal tribal support, the young people decided that they needed to carry out some sort of public action. Bobbi Jean Three Legs, a young mother and long-distance runner from Standing Rock who had become active in the camp, had a vision. Her daughter woke her one night to ask for water, and she suddenly saw a day when, thanks to water pollution, there would be no water to give. Soon after that, she and White Eyes proposed a 500-mile relay run from the Sacred Stone Camp to Omaha to deliver a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers, asking it to deny the Dakota Access Pipeline permission to cross the Missouri River. The I.E.N. began a social-media campaign announcing the run and organized a blitz of calls and letters from tribal members on various reservations. Within days, far sooner than expected, an Army Corps representative from the Omaha district agreed to meet with members of the tribe. To some, this meant the youths could call off the run. But they insisted on going ahead. Not only did they still want support from the tribal council; they had also begun to believe that this run could bring together young people from all the Sioux reservations. One Mind saw water as an issue that could unify all Oceti Sakowin youth. And their run had rich cultural resonance: Before Europeans brought horses, long-distance messenger runners held the scattered tribes of Oceti Sakowin together. Three Legs, White Eyes and Charger mapped a route to pass through as many reservations as possible. The run would use a traditional method in which a messenger ran a short distance, about a mile, and then rested while another runner took his or her place. It allowed people who were not very good runners, like Charger, to go on a long-distance run. Daniel Grassrope, now 25, came from the Lower Brule, a band whose reservation lay down the Missouri from Cheyenne River. As a child, he dreamed of being taken away from his family and adopted by whites, something he associated, vaguely, with having his own bedroom and a mother who came to his basketball games. The run immediately gave him what Standing Rock would later give many other youths: a sense of purpose he had been lacking. It also inspired something more radical, in a way, than antipipeline activism: the belief that a group of lost people from scattered nations could still find kinship. Grassrope wrote to Three Legs immediately. On April 24, the runners set off south from the Sacred Stone Camp. They ran along the Cannonball River to Highway 1806, then down toward Cheyenne River, their first stop. Grassrope ran next to Charger, who was carrying a heavy staff that represented their ancestors. When she got too tired, Grassrope carried it. In doing so, according to Lakota belief, they were literally carrying all those who had come before. At every reservation, they met not only with tribal leaders but also with reservation youths, whom they talked to just as they had in Cheyenne River, telling them about the old ways and the camp upriver where those ways were being revived. Because the Native American community has become heavily networked on social media as a modern means to keep the bands united, word spread far beyond the communities they visited. When the youths arrived in Omaha on May 3, a representative of the Army Corps of Engineers met with them on the steps of the office. They still felt motivated as they went back to Standing Rock. Grassrope quit his job in Lower Brule and settled into the camp with them. On July 15, 30 runners set out from Sacred Stone, adding more as they made their way along their route. She was in bed asleep when Jasilyn, passing through Cheyenne River, ran into their house, threw her clothes into a bag and urged her onto their support van. Over the course of the next week or so, a dozen more joined. But on July 26, the runners learned the Army Corps of Engineers had approved the Dakota Access pipeline easements. The black snake was on its way. The runners decided to carry on to Washington, but the focus shifted back to the camp, as I.E.N. activists at Standing Rock urged people via Facebook messages to rise to the standard set by the youths. They loaded cars and buses and camper vans with donations and headed for Standing Rock. Twenty-six-year-old Eryn Wise moved to the camp in late August, at the beginning of what organizers called the big boom, when the population spiked from dozens to thousands. A native of Minneapolis, Wise was raised by her grandmother on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation after a suicide attempt at 11. On the reservation, she was picked on for excelling at school but was surrounded by her siblings, with whom she formed a close bond. But she returned to Minneapolis when she was 16 to care for her mother. When she read an article about the youth run she felt a pull and quit her job. She found her twin siblings, Alex and Lauren Howland, already at the camp. Photo Eryn Wise in Washington following the inauguration. The run, Goldtooth told me, had forced their support by transforming the Dakota Access pipeline from a regional Lakota issue into an international one. Standing Rock council members began to visit the camps and pay for emergency services, propane and portable toilets. The Council Lodge was the traditional meeting place of the Oceti Sakowin in the 19th century, when the bands would gather on the Plains. It was part of a larger move toward formalizing the prayer camps under a council government. By then, the protests against the pipeline had, for the traditional leadership, become about far more: They had become a long-prophesied end to history. Not just to its people. Many of the youths that I spoke with took this to mean the Seventh Generation had a sort of messianic role to help restore order, on behalf of all beings, to a world thrown out of balance by modernity and greed. The Seventh Generation tracks roughly with millennials of all races, but they share their own unique history. The generation between Goldtooth, 34, and Charger, now 20, is the first to have grown up free to be Indian. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

Privacy Policy Opt out or contact us anytime Opt out or contact us anytime At Standing Rock, the elders, once resistant to their movement, now insisted that the youths accept the responsibility that the prophecy had foretold. In early September, the Seven Council Fires and Chief Arvol Looking Horse, who, for the Lakota Sioux, is something like their head of religion, gave the youths a gift: a chanupa, the ceremonial pipe that is the most sacred element of the Plains religion, a symbol of the knitting together of the human community and nature, ancestors with the living. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this gesture. We said they had to be of pure mind. After the ceremony, the youths, who had begun to call themselves the International Indigenous Youth Council, or I.I.Y.C., to symbolize their desire to unite all nations behind a traditional way of life, moved together into a tepee by the Cannonball River. The I.I.Y.C. was the first experience of family for many members. She shrugged. Charger was referring to Native American history, not just what happened on the frontier but also in more recent decades. After federal campaigns reduced the Oceti Sakowin in the late 1800s, there were nearly 100 years of calculated assault as the state tried to force Native Americans to assimilate. The unified nation of Oceti Sakowin was broken into widely separated reservations, and after Congress privatized reservation land, many starving Lakota families had to sell off their property to white farmers, further cutting the size of reservations. But perhaps most devastating to their psychological health were the boarding schools, in which generations of Indians were sent to schools to be taught white culture. This system reached its nadir in the forced assimilation campaigns of the 1940s and 1950s, when the grandparents of many of the I.I.Y.C. youths were taught English literally under the lash. At Standing Rock, the youths felt they were developing the means to overcome that trauma. The key, as Charger explained it, was to let their history go, which they took as an almost holy responsibility: Forgive, and then take action to spare those who are coming in the future. For many, this provided a means to re-establish difficult relationships with parents or siblings. But it also helped bind them together into their own sort of family. In the final months of 2016, the camps at Standing Rock grew to more than 10,000, filling with indigenous peoples from hundreds of nations, climate-change activists, members of the Rainbow Family and Burning Man communities and those who simply felt a call. By that point, the role of the I.I.Y.C. had become a sort of advance guard, taking risks and pushing actions forward and winning new young converts to the cause. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thomas Tonatiuh Lopez Jr. was one. A 24-year-old Lakota and Latino from Denver, Lopez grew up the child of AIM and Chicano activists, and as the adopted grandson of the powerful medicine man Leonard Crowdog. Once he found himself at the camp, Lopez was touched by the message of activism and reconciliation. One afternoon, he was sitting with I.I.Y.C. members, rolling cigarettes for everyone in front of a fire, as Charger talked about the role of youth. He thought about it as he drove home to Denver, and when he got there, he helped establish a local I.I.Y.C. chapter, drawing from local indigenous and Latino youths. In mid-November, the group took hundreds of Denver high-school students for a march through downtown to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline. The images of campers being maced or attacked by dogs spread anger across the country, and many brought that anger to Standing Rock. For traditional leadership, any violence was deeply concerning. Part of the matrix of prophecy that underlies their movement is the idea that should the Oceti Sakowin or their allies resort to violence, they could be wiped out. The youths took this seriously, even as they found themselves under physical threat. Wise, the camp mom, remembers, for instance, watching on Facebook Live as her sister was maced. Furious, she raced to the scene and threw herself at the police. Suddenly there were six hands on her shoulders: I.I.Y.C. members, pulling her back. She saw her brother Alex, his face white with what appeared to be war paint. But on Dec. 2, when the department posted on Facebook soliciting donations of granola bars, fruit soda and socks, the I.I.Y.C. showed up with large plastic containers filled with granola bars, warm clothing and water. The station was on lockdown; after a while, an officer looking sheepish in his helmet, faceplate and full body armor, opened the door and accepted the containers. Lopez half turned. It was a small gesture, but one that prompted thanks from the officers and anger from some in the camps. Wise remembers people asking. But prophecy was important to the youths; they worried that if the movement became too violent, it would ruin everything they had been trying to build. On Dec. 4, 2016, as thousands of military veterans from across the country crowded the camp in solidarity, the Department of the Army announced its decision to deny an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline route. The decision was a shock and an unexpected triumph. Now, with winter bearing down, he said, everyone could begin to go home. For them, leaving was more complicated. There was also a more personal problem. Many of them had nowhere else to go. They had become dependent on the I.I.Y.C. for a support network and a place to live. Over their months spent in close quarters, the members of the youth council had bound themselves together not only as friends but as family. The stakes of dissolving the group had become obvious in a more immediate way, too: One of the youth runners had already attempted suicide and been rushed to the hospital in Bismarck. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the camps emptied out, though, there were not enough resources for everyone to stay, and most of the young people dispersed for the winter, leaving behind a skeleton crew of 10. Wise went home to Minneapolis to begin a job as an organizer for Honor the Earth, an indigenous environmental activist group. Grassrope went back to Lower Brule. Charger was couch-surfing with friends in Eagle Butte. But the I.I.Y.C. were in the process of setting up a 501(c)(3), a nonprofit organization that would allow them to establish some formal order to what had been an ad hoc group. And in January, after a month apart, the I.I.Y.C. youths reunited in Washington for the mass protests against Donald Trump. They were still in Washington when the news came that he had signed executive orders allowing the Dakota Access and Keystone pipelines to proceed. After that, Jasilyn Charger made the trip back to Standing Rock. She planned to spend a couple of days there before heading south to Eagle Butte, where she would organize against the Keystone. He offered a practical reason as well: In December, back home in Denver, he got a call from a young person on the verge of suicide. Even if you feel no one loves you, no one cares about you, I love you, I care about you. I want to pray with you again. He paused.

Photo: Cynthia Mack In recent news, a pipeline about 150 miles from the Standing Rock camp has spilled an estimated 176,000 gallons of crude oil. A landowner discovered it the same day the permit was denied. The leak from the Belle Fourche Pipeline flowed into the Ash Coulee Creek near Belfield, N.D., and into U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. Some of the oil remains frozen over since the spill, but could potentially flow into the Little Missouri River. According to Wendy Owen, spokeswoman for the Wyoming-based True Companies, they have yet to determine the cause of the break. The oil cleanup is set to go on until spring. This is a reminder that the DAPL could potentially affect anyone who drinks and uses water. As in any fight for justice, there is a continued call to stand for basic human rights. Water is sacred.

And these female water protectors, many of whom are still camped out in North Dakota, remain central to the struggle to protect the Missouri River from a potential oil spill. As the movement continues to gain momentum on ancestral ground of the Great Sioux Nation, a coalition of female warriors are standing strong. They are mothers who fought and won to block the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015, and they are daughters whose fathers watched treaty territory diminish by seizures led by the federal government. Others are grandchildren who have inherited historical traumas linked to forced removal, assimilation, and genocide. For these women of Standing Rock, it is their calling, their responsibility. They are on the front lines, shaping the indigenous narrative, and standing up for what has captured the attention of the world. Ahead, these female water protectors crucial to the fight share their stories.

But today, the notion at Standing Rock is that the black snake resembles the 1,172 mile-long Dakota Access oil pipeline. It was indigenous women who were first to take on the bulldozers in an attempt to protect lands and water deemed sacred by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. They rushed to lead the protests, even as the demonstrations were rocked by clashes with police. But they say the fight is not yet over.

The Wet'suwet'en people have never lost in court against BC or Canada. In the Delgamuukw-Gisday'wa decision, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Wet'suwet'en rights and title had never been extinguished across the 22,000km2 of Wet'suwet'en Yin'tah. As was upheld in the Tsilhqot'in decision, Aboriginal title includes the right to exclusive use and occupation of land, and the right to decide its use. It is our people that steer our decisions as hereditary chiefs. The Delgamuukw-Gisdaywa ruling recognized the Baht'lats (Feast Hall) as the forum of Wet'suwet'en governance. In feasts, the Gilseyhu, Laksamishu, Gitdumden and Tsayu clans have rejected all pipeline proposals. The province is aware that all affected Wet'suwet'en house groups reject TransCanada's Coastal Gaslink project as it infringes on Wet'suweten Title, Rights, and Interests. This consultation process exacerbates conflict in our Wet'suwet'en communities and creates public confusion. They are going to the elected people who have only jurisdiction on reserve land. Wet'suwet'en people have already witnessed catastrophic impacts from unimpeded industrial access to our Yin'tah and neighbouring territories. From the damming of the Nechako River, which drowned our Caribou in 1952, to seepage of toxic tailings from Equity's silver mine that decimated the salmon stocks of Goosley Lake in the 1980s, to the many clear cuts that scar our lands, it is clear that industry cannot be left to their own devices to operate on our Yin'tah.

Army veterans return to Standing Rock to form a human shield against police Read more The charges against two veterans, who said they use medical cannabis to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, come days after a veterans service organization announced it would be returning to Standing Rock to provide support. News of the charges adds to growing concerns that law enforcement is aggressively monitoring, arresting and prosecuting people affiliated with the anti-pipeline movement. The Guardian recently reported that an FBI terrorism task force has attempted to contact at least three people tied to the demonstrations. Matthew Crane, one of five founding members of VeteransRespond, was pulled over last Friday night when he was arriving to Standing Rock with two other vets and a fourth passenger. The group got lost on a closed road, he said, and they were trying to find officers to get directions.

He lives in New York, where medical cannabis is also legal. On Thursday, police in Mobridge, South Dakota, arrested two individuals that officials claimed were VeteransRespond members. Sanderson, however, said they were not members, although one of them, Travis Biolette, is now loosely affiliated with the group, which is assisting him in his charges.

Photograph: Courtesy of Travis Biolette A police search found hash oil, which is classified as a controlled substance in South Dakota. Biolette and his friend were taken to jail in Selby, South Dakota. In a phone interview Monday night, Biolette said he spent four nights in jail and was released earlier in the day. He said that police pulled him over for speeding about six miles above the limit and that when he revealed he was going to Standing Rock, the officer launched a search. He said the hash oil is his prescribed medication, which he uses for PTSD and major depressive disorder. Biolette, who is now getting support from VeteransRespond members who picked him up from jail, said police still have his vehicle with all of his possessions, including his cold-weather clothing. Nonetheless, he was still planning on Monday night to go to Standing Rock, which he also visited last year. VeteransRespond has said it intends to help Standing Rock leaders on camp with a range of responsibilities, including cleanup efforts, kitchen help and medical aid.

With the help of his mom, he wrote a children's book about his experience. In August, the Oceti Sakowin Camp was setting up while more Indigenous people from across North America began to gather at the site where the Dakota Access Pipeline was to pass through the traditional territory of the Sioux. 'There were a lot of tents and teepees at the camp. There was a school and a medical tent,' says Aslan of Oceti Sakowin, the largest camp at Standing Rock. When the family returned in October it was a different scene. Kelly Tudor says there were many children at Standing Rock and the community kept them safe. (Submitted by Kelly Tudor ) The children spent time at the Defender of the Water school, which was set up to look after the children of the camp while their parents were at the pipeline site or volunteering their efforts in other areas. Even as the conflict escalated, his mom Kelly Tudor said the camp where the children were kept was a safe place. Tudor, 33, works as an emergency medical technician and was volunteering in the medical tent at the camp. She is a third generation American Indian Movement member and the representative for Indiana. Her family is originally from southern Texas, and she said she has raised her children as traditionally as possible in lines with her Lipan Apache culture, which hasn't always been easy living in Indianapolis. When she heard the call out for support at Standing Rock, she said she didn't hesitate to pack up the kids and drive 17 hours to the site. She said taking the children to Standing Rock helped bring them closer to other Indigenous people. Aslan Tudor at age 8 at the Standing Rock Reservation in South Dakota.

Aslan's mom typed out his words as he dictated and assisted with grammar and syntax. In just under a week, they were looking at a 12-page children's book. The book was released Aug. 8. Aslan said he hopes to write more in the future. She wants to contribute to turning the page on how Indigenous peoples are covered within Canadian media.

Republican legislators were blindsided. Within hours, Trump disavowed the deal, then reaffirmed it. Pence, who has dutifully stood by the President, mustering a devotional gaze rarely seen since the days of Nancy Reagan, serves as a daily reminder that the Constitution offers an alternative to Trump. The worse the President looks, the more desirable his understudy seems. Of his forty-seven predecessors, nine eventually assumed the Presidency, because of a death or a resignation. If the job is a gamble for Pence, he himself is something of a gamble for the country. During the tumultuous 2016 Presidential campaign, relatively little attention was paid to how Pence was chosen, or to his political record. Newt Gingrich told me recently that the three people with the most policy influence in the Administration are Trump, Chief of Staff John Kelly, and Pence. But look at the schedule. Pence has lunches with the President. Even so, they are almost comically mismatched. Trump campaigned as an unorthodox outsider, but Pence is a doctrinaire ideologue. Pence leans so far to the right that he has occasionally echoed A.C.L.U. arguments against government overreach; he has, for instance, supported a federal shield law that would protect journalists from having to identify whistle-blowers. But Pence has the political experience, the connections, the discipline, and the ideological mooring that Trump lacks. Pence is the inside man of the conservative money machine. A.C.S. was notorious for outsourcing U.S. office work to cheaper foreign-labor markets. Trump campaigned against outsourcing, but the Deasons became Trump backers nonetheless, donating a million dollars to his campaign. Doug Deason was enlisted, in part, by Pence, whom he had known and supported for years. Since the election, Deason has attended two dinners for wealthy backers at the Vice-Presidential residence. Among the billionaires who gathered in the room at the Hilton, Deason recalled, were the financier Wilbur Ross, whom Trump later appointed his Secretary of Commerce; the corporate investor Carl Icahn, who became a top adviser to Trump but resigned eight months later, when allegations of financial impropriety were published by The New Yorker; Harold Hamm, the founder and chairman of Continental Resources, an Oklahoma-based oil-and-gas company that has made billions of dollars through fracking; and David Koch, the richest resident of New York City. He and his brother Charles are libertarians who object to most government spending, including investments in infrastructure. Bannon is equally alarmed at the prospect of a Pence Presidency. Eighty-four and energetic, Fritsch met me for coffee this summer, along with her eldest son, Gregory, who is in the antiques business in the Columbus area. Like the Vice-President, they are good-looking, with chiselled features, and have an unpretentious, amiable manner. All the boys had nicknames. The family identifies as Catholic, and Mike was an altar boy. Brief mentions of Edward in the press have described him as having worked in the Chicago stockyards, leaving the impression that he was poor. But Gregory told me that Edward was well off, with a seat on the Chicago Stock Exchange. Fritsch went to secretarial school. A Korean War veteran, Edward Pence, Jr., was in uniform that night. In 1959, after leaving law school, he moved with Fritsch from Chicago to Columbus, where he sold fuel to gas stations, farms, and convenience stores. Edward, Jr., like his father, was a tough disciplinarian. He expected his children to stand up whenever an adult entered the room. At dinner, the kids were forbidden to speak. While Gregory was in college, he was sleeping late on a visit home when his father pulled the covers off him and told him to get up for church. His father stopped paying his tuition altogether. Columbus, which has a population of forty-five thousand, was dominated by a major engine manufacturer, Cummins, and escaped the economic woes that afflicted many other parts of the region. Protestant kids had thrown stones at him, he recalled. The Pence children attended St. Columba Catholic School through eighth grade. Mike discovered a talent for public speaking that made him a favorite with the nuns. In fifth grade, he won a local oratory contest, defeating kids several years older. In high school, Pence won third place in a national contest. Nonetheless, by senior year, Mike was talking to classmates about becoming President of the United States. Mike Pence attended Hanover College, a liberal-arts school in southeast Indiana. On a visit home, he told his father that he was thinking of either joining the priesthood or attending law school. His father suggested he start with law; he could always join the priesthood later. His conversion was part of a larger movement. Pence voted for Jimmy Carter in 1980, but he soon joined the march of many Christians toward the Republican Party. Weyrich condemned homosexuality, feminism, abortion, and government-imposed racial integration, and he partnered with some controversial figures, including Laszlo Pasztor, a former member of a pro-Nazi party in Hungary. While in law school, at Indiana University, Pence met and married Karen Batten, a schoolteacher whom he had noticed playing guitar in a church service. Pence took her ice-skating; she made him taco salad for dinner. They shellacked the loaf. The couple became almost inseparable. As the Washington Post reported, he kept it on his office desk long after the advent of cell phones. At home, they worked out on twin treadmills. Critics have argued that this approach reduces women to sexual temptresses and precludes men from working with women on an equal basis. He drew a blank. But after Mike entered the race Edward became his biggest booster, helping him raise money and put up lawn signs. Then, just a few weeks before the Republican primary, Edward, who was fifty-eight, had a heart attack and died. In 1990, Pence tried and failed again to unseat Sharp, waging a campaign that is remembered as especially nasty. One ad featured an actor dressed in Middle Eastern garb and sunglasses, who accused Sharp, falsely, of being a tool of Arab oil interests. There was a clear hierarchy in the Indianapolis legal world, and Pence was far from its top rungs, relying on referrals for work. Pence was thrown a lifeline in 1991, when he was offered a job as president of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, a tiny new think tank that promoted free-market policies. But the early funders of the Heritage Foundation included some Fortune 500 companies, in fields such as oil, chemicals, and tobacco, that opposed health, safety, and environmental regulations. In the early nineties, he joined the board of the Indiana Family Institute, a far-right group that supported the criminalization of abortion and campaigned against equal rights for homosexuals. And, while Pence ran the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, it published an essay arguing that unmarried women should be denied access to birth control. In 2012, after serving twenty-eight years in the legislature, she ran for lieutenant governor on a ticket with the gubernatorial candidate John R. Gregg, who lost the election to Pence. In 1992, he became a host on conservative talk radio, which had been booming since the F.C.C., in 1987, repealed the Fairness Doctrine and stopped requiring broadcasters to provide all sides of controversial issues. At a time when bombastic, angry voices proliferated, Pence was different. Like Reagan, who had become his political hero, he could present even extreme positions in genial, nonthreatening terms. In 1994, Pence was on eighteen Emmis stations, five days a week. He won, by a twelve-point margin. Pence was in demand on the conservative speaking circuit, and frequently appeared on Sunday talk shows. Michael Leppert, a Democratic lobbyist in Indiana, saw Pence differently. Pence served twelve years in Congress, but never authored a single successful bill. In 2006, Pence boldly challenged the House Minority Leader at the time, John Boehner, a more centrist Republican from Ohio, for his post. The chair presides over weekly meetings in which Republican House members discuss policy and legislative goals. After Barack Obama was elected President, Pence became an early voice of the Tea Party movement, which opposed taxes and government spending with an angry edge. In 2011, he made the evening news by threatening to shut down the federal government unless it defunded Planned Parenthood. His radicalism, however, only boosted his national profile. Pence became best known for fiercely opposing abortion. He sponsored an unsuccessful amendment to the Affordable Care Act that would have made it legal for government-funded hospitals to turn away a dying woman who needed an abortion. (Later, as governor of Indiana, he signed a bill barring women from aborting a physically abnormal fetus; the bill also required fetal burial or cremation, including after a miscarriage. It guides him. According to Scott Peterson, the executive director of the Checks & Balances Project, a watchdog group that monitors attempts to influence environmental policy, Pence was invited to the Koch seminar only after he did the brothers a major political favor. By the spring of 2009, Koch Industries, like other fossil-fuel companies, felt threatened by growing support in Congress for curbing carbon emissions, the primary cause of climate change. At first, the campaign languished, attracting only fourteen signatures. If the bill were enacted, the costs could be catastrophic to Koch Industries, which releases some twenty-four million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year, and owns millions of acres of untapped oil reserves in Canada, plus coal-fired power plants and oil refineries. He not only signed their pledge but urged others to do so as well. His language echoed that of the Koch groups. The cap-and-trade bill died in the Senate. In any event, the pledge marked a pivotal turn in the climate-change debate, cementing Republican opposition to addressing the environmental crisis. But the House of Representatives is a tough platform from which to get elected President. And so, in 2012, after mulling over his national prospects, Pence ran instead for governor of Indiana. David Koch contributed two hundred thousand dollars. It served as a dark-money bank, enabling donors to stay anonymous while distributing funds to favored campaigns and political organizations. But after he was elected he began taking controversial far-right stands that, critics believed, were geared more toward building his national profile than toward serving Indiana voters. At first, Pence highlighted fiscal conservatism. In 2013, he proposed cutting the state income tax. Indiana Republicans, who had majorities in both legislative chambers, initially balked at the tax cut, deeming it irresponsible. The state recently had to increase its gas tax by ten cents per gallon, to repair its crumbling infrastructure. In a few surprising instances, Pence veered from conservative orthodoxy. In 2014, he broke with many other Republican governors and agreed to expand Medicaid in Indiana. Nevertheless, Pence negotiated with the Obama Administration and established waivers that made the expansion acceptable to him. Critics argued that such measures were needlessly punitive toward poor residents. But the Medicaid-expansion plan was, and remains, popular in the state. After this apostasy, Pence tilted back toward the right. At the last minute, he killed an application for an eighty-million-dollar federal grant to start a statewide preschool program. Eventually, after widespread criticism, Pence reapplied for the grant. Political handicappers noticed that Pence was spending a lot of time taking trips to states with important Presidential primaries and mingling with big out-of-state donors. In the summer of 2014, Pence spoke at an Americans for Prosperity summit in Dallas. That fall, Pence reached out to Nick Ayers, a young, sharp-elbowed political consultant, to see if he would help him in a 2016 Presidential run. Nothing came of it, but Pence clearly had White House ambitions. In the spring of 2015, Pence signed a bill called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which he presented as innocuous. Oesterle recalled. But then a photograph of the closed signing session surfaced. It showed Pence surrounded by monks and nuns, along with three of the most virulently anti-gay activists in the state. The image went viral. Indiana residents began examining the law more closely, and discovered that it essentially legalized discrimination against homosexuals by businesses in the state. In his view, Pence should have prevented it and other extreme bills from moving forward. The outcry over the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was enormous. Gay-rights groups condemned the bill and urged boycotts of the state. Pete Buttigieg, the young gay mayor of South Bend, who is a rising figure in the Democratic Party, told me that he tried to talk to Pence about the legislation, which he felt would cause major economic damage to Indiana. In an effort to quell criticism, Pence consented, against the advice of his staff, to be interviewed by George Stephanopoulos on his Sunday-morning show on ABC. Stephanopoulos asked him five times if it was now legal in Indiana for businesses to discriminate against homosexuals, and each time Pence was evasive. Pence also sidestepped when Stephanopoulos asked him if he personally supported discrimination against gays. Smulyan, the broadcasting executive, began getting calls from acquaintances all over the country, asking what was wrong with Indiana. Companies began cancelling conventions, and threatening to reverse plans to expand in the state. The Indiana business community foresaw millions of dollars in losses. When the N.C.A.A., which is based in Indianapolis, declared its opposition to the legislation, the pressure became intolerable. Even the Republican establishment turned on Pence. Within days, the legislature had pushed through a less discriminatory version of the bill, and Pence signed it, before hastily leaving town for the weekend. His polls were terrible. But he went from being a likely loser as an incumbent governor to Vice-President of the United States. Pence loyalists rushed in to help. Ayers, the political operative whom Pence had consulted in 2011 about a Presidential run, became an outside adviser. The state also signed a seven-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar contract with a public-relations firm, Porter Novelli, which proposed running ads featuring gay and lesbian couples posing in front of Indiana landmarks. In 2015, Ed Clere, a Republican state legislator who chaired the House Committee on Public Health, became aware of a spike in the number of H.I.V. cases in southern Indiana. The problem appeared to be caused by the sharing of needles among opioid abusers in Scott County, which sits across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky. Now they were getting up to twenty a week. The area was poor, and woefully unprepared for a health crisis. But conservatives blocked the idea, and Pence threatened to veto any such legislation. In March, 2015, Clere staged a huge public hearing, in which dozens of experts and sufferers testified about the crisis. Caught flat-footed, Pence scheduled his own event, where he announced that he would pray about the syringe-exchange issue. The next day, he said that he supported allowing an exchange program as an emergency measure, but only on a temporary basis and only in Scott County, with no state funding. After Scott County implemented the syringe exchange, the number of new H.I.V. cases fell. But Republican leaders later stripped Clere of his committee chairmanship, a highly unusual event. Clere remains bitter about Pence. After the November, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, Pence, like several other U.S. governors, issued a controversial executive order barring the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state. The Archdiocese of Indiana had long been deeply involved in resettling refugees, including Syrians, and was about to welcome a new Syrian family. Tobin, who has since been elevated to cardinal and become the archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, told me that he emphasized to Pence that the Syrian family was fleeing violence and terror, and had been vetted for nearly two years while living in a Jordanian refugee camp. He also explained that the family had relatives in the area. Tobin brought along a former refugee who now had a good job at an Indiana hotel, as an example of how successful the resettlement process was. Tobin is revered in the Catholic community of Indiana in which Pence grew up. Later that week, the Syrian family was sent to Connecticut. I asked Cardinal Tobin if there was a Christian argument in support of turning the refugees away. He was released in 2006, but on the condition that he admit guilt, which made it impossible for him to get a decent job. The prosecutor and the Indiana Parole Board, citing DNA evidence and victim recantations, urged Governor Pence to pardon him immediately. But Pence dragged out the process for years. Pence finally left the decision to his successor, Governor Eric Holcomb, who is also a Republican. Holcomb granted Cooper a pardon within weeks of taking office. It was the first time in Indiana that a pardon was granted on the basis of innocence, rather than clemency. Cooper, who was operating a forklift at the time, now cares for his grandchildren. He has become friendly with the robbery victims who mistakenly identified him in a police lineup; they supported his bid for a pardon. He wrote a letter. They saw that justice happened. He hates Muslims, he hates gay people, and he hates minorities. A spokesman for Pence, who declined to be quoted, said Pence believed that Cooper needed to go back to court and face a retrial, instead of seeking a pardon. Pence, seeing his poll numbers plummet, gave up on running for President, and decided to seek a second term as governor. Victory was far from assured. Once again, he faced John Gregg, a folksy Democratic lawyer. In the spring of 2016, polls showed the two in a dead heat. The national election, meanwhile, was confounding expectations. As Trump picked up momentum in the Republican primaries, the Koch network became unexpectedly paralyzed. Marc Short pressed the brothers to dedicate their resources to stopping Trump and promoting his rivals. But executives at Koch Industries considered the strategy risky, and the brothers stayed out of the Presidential race. The Indiana primary was on May 3rd. The previous month, Ted Cruz had trounced Trump in Wisconsin, but if Trump could win decisively in Indiana he was virtually certain to secure the nomination. Hilbert had built an insurance empire, Conseco, which had been valued at fifty-two billion dollars before collapsing into bankruptcy. In 1998, Hilbert loaned Trump money to buy the General Motors Building, and they had remained friends. As governor, he proclaimed his opposition to any expansion of the gaming industry, but, though the state had banned political contributions from casino operators, cash had flowed generously to him from such sources, through indirect paths. An L.L.C. connected to Centaur contributed two hundred thousand dollars to the R.G.A. that year. The casino operator Sheldon Adelson contributed a million dollars. But the single largest donor to the R.G.A. in 2016 was Koch Industries, which contributed more than two million dollars. Trump handily won the Indiana primary. Pence, who had tepidly endorsed Ted Cruz, switched to Trump. In 2011, Pence had gone to Trump Tower in Manhattan, seeking a campaign donation. Pence reacted stiffly, and their conversation grew awkward. Trump gave Pence a small contribution, but the coarse New York billionaire and the prim Indiana evangelical appeared to be on different wavelengths. Nevertheless, in 2016, political insiders in Indiana began hearing that Pence would welcome a spot on the Trump ticket. Pence was seen as a bridge to Christian conservatives, an asset in the Midwest, and a connection to the powerful Koch network. Still, Trump remained wary. According to a former campaign aide, he was disapproving when he learned how little money Pence had. In 2016, according to a campaign-finance disclosure form, Pence had one bank account, which held less than fifteen thousand dollars. Trump came closer to picking Christie than is generally known. On July 11th, Christie appeared at a campaign event with Trump. The next day, Trump flew to Indiana to do a campaign event with Pence. They joined the Pences for dinner at an Indianapolis restaurant. The foursome emerged looking happy. Christie said. But Christie was left hanging for the next three days. Trump began leaning toward Pence. They both knew what it was about. But it was a gamble. He took out student loans for the kids. Some politicians in Indiana were surprised that Trump wanted to pick Pence, who was flailing as governor, and that Pence wanted to run with Trump. But that night, as CNN reported, Trump called his aides to see if he could back out of his decision. A few hours later, Trump announced Pence as his running mate. Several days later, at the Republican National Convention, Newt Gingrich, who had also been passed over for the Vice-Presidency, found himself backstage next to Trump while Pence was giving his acceptance speech. They urged Trump to pray. Pence exceeded expectations in the Vice-Presidential debate, and traversed the Midwest tirelessly. The Kochs continued to withhold financial support from Trump, but Short, the former Koch operative, became a top adviser to Pence on the campaign. The Koch network gained even further sway after Trump won the Presidency. Three days after the election, Trump pushed aside Christie, who had been overseeing his transition team, and put Pence in charge, with Short as a top deputy. He was also superstitious, and during his campaign he had deflected discussions about post-election staffing, fearing that it would bring bad luck. Trump began to appoint an extraordinary number of officials with ties to the Kochs and to Pence, especially in positions that affected Koch Industries financially, such as those dealing with regulatory, environmental, and fiscal policy. Short, who a few months earlier had tried to enlist the Kochs to stop Trump, joined the White House as its director of legislative affairs. Scott Pruitt, the militantly anti-regulatory attorney general of Oklahoma, who had been heavily supported by the Kochs, was appointed director of the Environmental Protection Agency. Don McGahn, who had done legal work for Freedom Partners, became White House counsel. A recent analysis by the Checks & Balances Project found that sixteen high-ranking officials in the Trump White House had ties to the Kochs. Pence reportedly consulted with Charles Koch before hiring his speechwriter, Stephen Ford, who previously worked at Freedom Partners. Americans for Prosperity recently announced plans to spend four and a half million dollars on ads that will press three Democratic senators in red states to support the tax cuts. On September 25th, Trump dined at the White House with Tim Phillips, the head of Americans for Prosperity, along with Short and a handful of other conservative activists. After keeping a careful distance from one another during the campaign, Pence and the Kochs reunited openly for the first time on October 13th, when Pence attended a summit of Koch donors in New York. Before Pence took over the transition team, Christie had warned Trump not to give a high-level job to the retired general Michael Flynn, whose financial ties to foreign interests triggered the investigation. Christie considered him too risky. On November 11, 2016, Christie was chairing a transition meeting, when, according to four sources, Flynn walked in with an ally, General Keith Kellogg. Christie asked. Christie tried to reclaim control of the meeting, but Ivanka took over. Flynn expressed interest in becoming Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense. Eric Trump, who was also on the team, asked Flynn if he had been out of uniform long enough to head the Pentagon. A few hours later, Christie was deposed. Kushner, he felt, had humiliated him a second time. Bannon, who was given the job of dismissing him, admitted to Christie that Kushner had been against him all along, for personal reasons. In any event, when Pence replaced Christie, the door of the White House was opened to Flynn. But Cummings produced an e-mail from the transition staff acknowledging his letter and promising to review it carefully. It undoubtedly would have cost Pence to take a political stand against the worst instincts of Trump and his family. Pence soon delivered a series of misleading statements about Flynn. On January 15th, as questions about Russian manipulation of the election were mounting, Pence went on CBS and assured the public that, during the transition, Flynn had not discussed the topic of sanctions with the Russian Ambassador. But then the Washington Post reported that the Justice Department had wiretaps of Flynn doing just that. The Justice Department had informed the White House counsel about this well before Pence made his statement. On February 13th, Trump fired Flynn, ostensibly for deceiving Pence, who looked like either a liar or a chump. Pence has hired an outside lawyer, Richard Cullen, and has further strengthened his political armor by hiring Nick Ayers as his chief of staff. Unlike most Vice-Presidents, Pence has been given no particular portfolio of issues or projects. White House officials had miscalculated, believing that McCain was on their side. Before taking the job, Mondale got Carter to agree, in writing, that he could attend every meeting and see every memo that the President did. Mondale also requested that his office be moved from the Old Executive Office Building to the West Wing. Trump is known to humiliate subordinates, and Mondale noted that Trump often asks Pence to act as a master of ceremonies and introduce him at events, which Mondale finds demeaning. Pence readily complied when Trump asked him to stage a protest at an N.F.L. game in Indianapolis on October 8th, by leaving the stadium when some players refused to stand for the national anthem. The legal scholar had said that, if the Supreme Court did so, many states would likely legalize abortion on their own. At the White House, Pence has been hosting a Bible-study group for Cabinet officers, led by an evangelical pastor named Ralph Drollinger. Several Trump Cabinet officials have reportedly attended the Bible-study group, including DeVos, Pompeo, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Many Americans have debated whether the country would be better off with Pence as President. Newt Gingrich predicts that Pence will probably get a chance to do so.

The previous day, President Trump had dined with Democratic leaders at the White House, and had impetuously agreed to a major policy reversal, granting provisional residency to undocumented immigrants who came to America as children. Republican legislators were blindsided. Within hours, Trump disavowed the deal, then reaffirmed it. The worse the President looks, the more desirable his understudy seems. odds of becoming President are long but not prohibitive. Of his forty-seven predecessors, nine eventually assumed the Presidency, because of a death or a resignation. During the tumultuous 2016 Presidential campaign, relatively little attention was paid to how Pence was chosen, or to his political record. But look at the schedule. Pence has lunches with the President. Even so, they are almost comically mismatched. Trump campaigned as an unorthodox outsider, but Pence is a doctrinaire ideologue. Pence leans so far to the right that he has occasionally echoed A.C.L.U. arguments against government overreach; he has, for instance, supported a federal shield law that would protect journalists from having to identify whistle-blowers. But Pence has the political experience, the connections, the discipline, and the ideological mooring that Trump lacks. A.C.S. was notorious for outsourcing U.S. office work to cheaper foreign-labor markets. Trump campaigned against outsourcing, but the Deasons became Trump backers nonetheless, donating a million dollars to his campaign. Doug Deason was enlisted, in part, by Pence, whom he had known and supported for years. presence was especially unexpected. Bannon is equally alarmed at the prospect of a Pence Presidency.

The state also signed a seven-hundred-and-fifty-thousand-dollar contract with a public-relations firm, Porter Novelli, which proposed running ads featuring gay and lesbian couples posing in front of Indiana landmarks. 2015, Ed Clere, a Republican state legislator who chaired the House Committee on Public Health, became aware of a spike in the number of H.I.V. cases in southern Indiana. The problem appeared to be caused by the sharing of needles among opioid abusers in Scott County, which sits across the Ohio River from Louisville, Kentucky. Now they were getting up to twenty a week. The area was poor, and woefully unprepared for a health crisis. conservatives blocked the idea, and Pence threatened to veto any such legislation. In March, 2015, Clere staged a huge public hearing, in which dozens of experts and sufferers testified about the crisis. Caught flat-footed, Pence scheduled his own event, where he announced that he would pray about the syringe-exchange issue. The next day, he said that he supported allowing an exchange program as an emergency measure, but only on a temporary basis and only in Scott County, with no state funding. After Scott County implemented the syringe exchange, the number of new H.I.V. cases fell. But Republican leaders later stripped Clere of his committee chairmanship, a highly unusual event. remains bitter about Pence. After the November, 2015, terrorist attacks in Paris, Pence, like several other U.S. governors, issued a controversial executive order barring the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the state. The Archdiocese of Indiana had long been deeply involved in resettling refugees, including Syrians, and was about to welcome a new Syrian family. who has since been elevated to cardinal and become the archbishop of Newark, New Jersey, told me that he emphasized to Pence that the Syrian family was fleeing violence and terror, and had been vetted for nearly two years while living in a Jordanian refugee camp. He also explained that the family had relatives in the area. Tobin brought along a former refugee who now had a good job at an Indiana hotel, as an example of how successful the resettlement process was. Later that week, the Syrian family was sent to Connecticut. I asked Cardinal Tobin if there was a Christian argument in support of turning the refugees away. He was released in 2006, but on the condition that he admit guilt, which made it impossible for him to get a decent job. The prosecutor and the Indiana Parole Board, citing DNA evidence and victim recantations, urged Governor Pence to pardon him immediately. But Pence dragged out the process for years. Pence finally left the decision to his successor, Governor Eric Holcomb, who is also a Republican. Holcomb granted Cooper a pardon within weeks of taking office. Cooper, who was operating a forklift at the time, now cares for his grandchildren. He has become friendly with the robbery victims who mistakenly identified him in a police lineup; they supported his bid for a pardon. He wrote a letter. They saw that justice happened. He hates Muslims, he hates gay people, and he hates minorities. seeing his poll numbers plummet, gave up on running for President, and decided to seek a second term as governor. Victory was far from assured. Once again, he faced John Gregg, a folksy Democratic lawyer. national election, meanwhile, was confounding expectations. As Trump picked up momentum in the Republican primaries, the Koch network became unexpectedly paralyzed. Marc Short pressed the brothers to dedicate their resources to stopping Trump and promoting his rivals. But executives at Koch Industries considered the strategy risky, and the brothers stayed out of the Presidential race. Indiana primary was on May 3rd. The previous month, Ted Cruz had trounced Trump in Wisconsin, but if Trump could win decisively in Indiana he was virtually certain to secure the nomination. Hilbert had built an insurance empire, Conseco, which had been valued at fifty-two billion dollars before collapsing into bankruptcy. In 1998, Hilbert loaned Trump money to buy the General Motors Building, and they had remained friends. As governor, he proclaimed his opposition to any expansion of the gaming industry, but, though the state had banned political contributions from casino operators, cash had flowed generously to him from such sources, through indirect paths. An L.L.C. connected to Centaur contributed two hundred thousand dollars to the R.G.A. that year. The casino operator Sheldon Adelson contributed a million dollars. But the single largest donor to the R.G.A. in 2016 was Koch Industries, which contributed more than two million dollars. handily won the Indiana primary. In 2011, Pence had gone to Trump Tower in Manhattan, seeking a campaign donation. Pence reacted stiffly, and their conversation grew awkward. Pence was seen as a bridge to Christian conservatives, an asset in the Midwest, and a connection to the powerful Koch network. Trump remained wary. According to a former campaign aide, he was disapproving when he learned how little money Pence had. came closer to picking Christie than is generally known. On July 11th, Christie appeared at a campaign event with Trump. The next day, Trump flew to Indiana to do a campaign event with Pence. They joined the Pences for dinner at an Indianapolis restaurant. The foursome emerged looking happy. Christie was left hanging for the next three days. Trump began leaning toward Pence. They both knew what it was about. But it was a gamble. He took out student loans for the kids. Some politicians in Indiana were surprised that Trump wanted to pick Pence, who was flailing as governor, and that Pence wanted to run with Trump. But that night, as CNN reported, Trump called his aides to see if he could back out of his decision. days later, at the Republican National Convention, Newt Gingrich, who had also been passed over for the Vice-Presidency, found himself backstage next to Trump while Pence was giving his acceptance speech. They urged Trump to pray. exceeded expectations in the Vice-Presidential debate, and traversed the Midwest tirelessly. The Kochs continued to withhold financial support from Trump, but Short, the former Koch operative, became a top adviser to Pence on the campaign. Koch network gained even further sway after Trump won the Presidency. Three days after the election, Trump pushed aside Christie, who had been overseeing his transition team, and put Pence in charge, with Short as a top deputy. He was also superstitious, and during his campaign he had deflected discussions about post-election staffing, fearing that it would bring bad luck. began to appoint an extraordinary number of officials with ties to the Kochs and to Pence, especially in positions that affected Koch Industries financially, such as those dealing with regulatory, environmental, and fiscal policy. Short, who a few months earlier had tried to enlist the Kochs to stop Trump, joined the White House as its director of legislative affairs. Scott Pruitt, the militantly anti-regulatory attorney general of Oklahoma, who had been heavily supported by the Kochs, was appointed director of the Environmental Protection Agency. Don McGahn, who had done legal work for Freedom Partners, became White House counsel. A recent analysis by the Checks & Balances Project found that sixteen high-ranking officials in the Trump White House had ties to the Kochs. for Prosperity recently announced plans to spend four and a half million dollars on ads that will press three Democratic senators in red states to support the tax cuts. On September 25th, Trump dined at the White House with Tim Phillips, the head of Americans for Prosperity, along with Short and a handful of other conservative activists. After keeping a careful distance from one another during the campaign, Pence and the Kochs reunited openly for the first time on October 13th, when Pence attended a summit of Koch donors in New York. Before Pence took over the transition team, Christie had warned Trump not to give a high-level job to the retired general Michael Flynn, whose financial ties to foreign interests triggered the investigation. November 11, 2016, Christie was chairing a transition meeting, when, according to four sources, Flynn walked in with an ally, General Keith Kellogg. Christie asked. Christie tried to reclaim control of the meeting, but Ivanka took over. expressed interest in becoming Secretary of State or Secretary of Defense. Eric Trump, who was also on the team, asked Flynn if he had been out of uniform long enough to head the Pentagon. few hours later, Christie was deposed. Kushner, he felt, had humiliated him a second time. Bannon, who was given the job of dismissing him, admitted to Christie that Kushner had been against him all along, for personal reasons. In any event, when Pence replaced Christie, the door of the White House was opened to Flynn. But Cummings produced an e-mail from the transition staff acknowledging his letter and promising to review it carefully. soon delivered a series of misleading statements about Flynn. On January 15th, as questions about Russian manipulation of the election were mounting, Pence went on CBS and assured the public that, during the transition, Flynn had not discussed the topic of sanctions with the Russian Ambassador. The Justice Department had informed the White House counsel about this well before Pence made his statement. Pence has hired an outside lawyer, Richard Cullen, and has further strengthened his political armor by hiring Nick Ayers as his chief of staff. most Vice-Presidents, Pence has been given no particular portfolio of issues or projects. Before taking the job, Mondale got Carter to agree, in writing, that he could attend every meeting and see every memo that the President did. Mondale also requested that his office be moved from the Old Executive Office Building to the West Wing. Trump is known to humiliate subordinates, and Mondale noted that Trump often asks Pence to act as a master of ceremonies and introduce him at events, which Mondale finds demeaning. Pence readily complied when Trump asked him to stage a protest at an N.F.L. game in Indianapolis on October 8th, by leaving the stadium when some players refused to stand for the national anthem. The legal scholar had said that, if the Supreme Court did so, many states would likely legalize abortion on their own. At the White House, Pence has been hosting a Bible-study group for Cabinet officers, led by an evangelical pastor named Ralph Drollinger. Several Trump Cabinet officials have reportedly attended the Bible-study group, including DeVos, Pompeo, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Americans have debated whether the country would be better off with Pence as President. Newt Gingrich predicts that Pence will probably get a chance to do so. Pence has shown nothing but unconditional support for Trump. H. Koch in 1996. critics yearn for his exit. girlfriend, V, and I were finishing college, with a summer to burn before the next thing, and New York beckoned. V went to the city and signed a three-month lease on the apartment of a Columbia student, Bobby Atkins, who may have been the son of the creator of the Atkins Diet, or maybe we just enjoyed imagining that he was. His place, on the southwest corner of 110th Street and Amsterdam, had two small bedrooms and was irremediably filthy. In 1981, before full-scale gentrification, before mass incarceration, the city seemed starkly drawn in black and white. I was aesthetically attracted to cities but morbidly afraid of being shot. In New York, Amsterdam Avenue was a sharp dividing line, and I stood on the east side of it only once, when I made the mistake of riding a C train to 110th and walking home from there. It was late afternoon and nobody paid attention to me, but I was light-headed with fear. Deepening my impression of menace were the heavy, light-blocking security gates on our windows and the police lock in our entry hall, its steel rod anchored to the floor and angling up to a slot on the front door. I associated it with our next-door neighbor, an elderly white man with raging senile dementia. He would pound on our door or stand on the landing, wearing only pajama bottoms, and asseverate, over and over, using a vile epithet, that his wife was having relations with black men. theory, V and I were trying to write fiction, but I was oppressed by the summer heat and by the penitentiary gloom of the Atkins place, the cockroaches, the wandering neighbor. V and I fought, wept, made up, and played with our black panther. Conceivably my parents, despite their disapproval of New York and of my cohabitation with V, had given me some hundreds of dollars. my brother Tom was in New York that summer, doing a loft conversion for the hot-shot young photographer Gregory Heisler. But Heisler could see that Tom had all the know-how. Before long, the friend was sent back to Chicago, leaving Tom without a laborer. His loft was at the corner of Broadway and Houston, on the top floor of the Cable Building, then a den of sweatshops, later the home of the Angelika Theatre. Heisler wanted every surface in the apartment covered with a trendy gray plastic laminate whose little raised dots made edging it with a router a nightmare. main job was to fetch things. Every morning, Tom gave me a shopping list of construction staples and exotica, and I made the rounds of supply stores on the Bowery and Canal Street. East of the Bowery were the dangerous alphabet streets and the projects, a zone of no-go on my mental map of the island. Lower Broadway was peopled with garment workers, and the city below Canal seemed hung over from the seventies, as if the buildings were surprised to find themselves still standing. I started with black-bean soup and was a few spoonfuls into it when the beans seemed to come alive on my tongue, churning with a kind of malevolent aggression. I reached into my mouth and pulled out a narrow shard of glass. V flagged down our server and complained to him. The server summoned the manager, who apologized, examined the piece of glass, disappeared with it, and then came back to hustle us out of the restaurant. I was pressing a napkin to my tongue to stanch the bleeding. At the door, I asked if it was O.K. for me to keep the napkin. Eventually, a doctor told me that my cut would heal quickly and did not require stitches, but I had to wait a couple of hours to receive this information and a tetanus shot. Directly across from me, in one of the corridors where I waited, a young African-American woman was lying on a gurney with a gunshot wound in her bared abdomen. The wound was leaking pinkish fluid but was evidently not life-threatening. I had a personal connection with the Harlemites in my building, and after work I could go downtown and safely walk with my friends on the alphabet streets, which were being colonized by young white people. White power had reasserted itself through the pressure of real-estate prices and police action. In hindsight, the era of white fear seems most remarkable for having lasted as long as it did. Before I left the bank, I discreetly slipped the bills into one of my socks. In this memoir, the author chronicles her relentless quest for religious fulfillment, which leads her from a voodoo shrine in Louisiana to a Presbyterian church in Brooklyn. Culled from interviews with the subject, this compilation offers an amiable portrait of the influential gallerist, curator, and museum director. At the center of this linguistically and structurally complex novel are two siblings, one of whom is adopted, who are deeply in love. Rachel and Zachariah, both Russian, share parents and a mania for boxing. Rachel is a scholar of the sport; Zach is a frustrated fighter, benched by a clot in his brain. The couple invent a lengthy story about a boxer named Sam the Russian, which is written to create a lineage for Zach, an orphan. This roving, ambitious novel follows two sisters from Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, Liz, her anthropologist sister, travels to a remote fictional island in the Southeast Pacific, called New Ulster, to study an enigmatic cult. Laird, who grew up during the Troubles, is well acquainted with the gods and ghosts that populate Northern Ireland. filmmakers were standing outside the Jefferson Street subway station, their first return to Bushwick since they shot on location there in 2015. remarked on how the area was changing. Skirting new construction on Wyckoff Avenue, he nodded toward an orange Jaguar parked outside a natural-food store. Murnion and Milott started what-iffing military scenarios and pitched a movie. they crossed Cypress Avenue, they pointed to an alley. tour ended, as the movie does, at Grover Cleveland Playground. The final scene is a night skirmish amid the swings and jungle gyms. There was not one complaint. I remember a monstrous tangle of arms and legs and fists, with me at the bottom, gouging at eyes and doing my utmost to mangle throats, but I arrived at the facility without a scratch or a bruise. I must have been easy to subdue. was a county lockup, with its ground level devoted to the intake area and the offices and so on and, above that, two levels for inmates. They put me on the lower tier, among the rowdies and thugs. The air smelled like disinfectant and something else that was meant to be killed by disinfectant. The cells stayed open, and we were free to go in and out and congregate in the central area or stroll on the catwalk that girded the whole tier. This resulted in a lot of wandering around by as many as twenty men in denim pants and blue work shirts and rubber-soled canvas moccasins, a lot of pacing and stopping, and leaning and sitting, and getting up and pacing again. Most of us would have fit in perfectly in a psych ward. Many of us had already been there. The jailers called him Michael, but he referred to himself as Jocko, and the other prisoners did, too. Jocko hustled around all day looking for somebody to listen to his opinions or, even better, arm-wrestle him. He was not yet twenty-one. Jocko knew all the deputies and staff around the jailhouse. He lacked any ambition or strategy for crowning himself king of the cell block, but he was nevertheless a star, and the lesser lights constellated around him. first morning on the tier I did sleep through breakfast, and somebody did steal mine. Cornflakes for breakfast. Lunch: baloney on white. For dinner, one of the canned creations of Chef Boyardee, or, on lucky days, Dinty Moore. lunch most days, Jocko organized a poker game that worked as follows: hands of five-card draw would be dealt out and the draw accomplished, and the player with the highest hand got the privilege of slugging each of the others in the meat of his shoulder with such a smack it echoed around the metal environment. Only half a dozen prisoners took part. The rest of us could see that damage was being done. I kept to the farthest margins. I stood five-seven and weighed a hundred and twenty. guy I never heard addressed by any name. After his episodes he sat on the floor, rolling the back of his head from side to side against the steel rivets in the wall. The others watched him from a distance. It was that moment in the day when time itself grew outrageously lopsided, getting further and further from lunch but somehow no closer to supper, and the bars became harder than iron, and you really felt locked up. It was the moment for another nap, or for staring at the television. poker players were well into their twenties, a couple in their thirties, men awaiting trial for felonies or serving lengthy misdemeanor time. Bob and I sat in our cell, side by side on his bunk. made himself the sentry now. boy went back to the central area and sat down. followed the boy and stood beside his chair. lost his cool. He pretty well combusted in his cell and came out already burning alive. Standing on the table, he lifted his arms and strained against invisible bars. He really was enormous, both muscular and overfed, looked fashioned from balloons, at least usually, but at this moment looked sculpted from quivering stone, his face plum-purple under the heap of yellow hair. With a certain grace he stepped from tabletop to chair to floor. He marched around with vicious movements, crushing hallucinatory animals. His footsteps thundered on the catwalk. HAD it. one knew what to make of these fireworks. bands were permitted, yes. Pets and children wandered loose in the streets. Respected citizens threw their litter anywhere. Dundun showed me how to roll a cigarette. Dundun came from the trailer courts, and I was middle class gone crazy, but we passed the time together freely because we both had long hair and chased after any kind of intoxicating substance. Dundun, only nineteen, already displayed up and down both his arms the tattooed veins of a hope-to-die heroin addict. The same went for B.D., a boy who arrived the week before Christmas. That was his dodge. His head, however, was pretty large, with a curly brown mane. In any case, B.D. was most generous. He tore the page from the magazine, divided it into thirds, and shared one third with me and one with Donald Dundun, offering us this shredded contraband as a surprise on Christmas Eve. We gave away our suppers and choked down the paper on empty stomachs and waited to get lost. Lemme see your tongue. A lot of disorderly characters rattled loose from there and ended up in Johnson County, often in the Johnson County jail. And, when I left the house, there was Chuckie sitting in his car out front, drinking a beer and puffing on a Kool. Parked right behind my rig. Probably sitting there the whole time me and Janet are rolling around in his bed. And when I open the door to my truck, he flashes me the finger. I had heard of him. Nobody else had. Viola. Viola will not forgive, and Viola will not forget. Hey. started climbing on the bars of the nearest cell. mental space, customarily empty, had been invaded by an animal spirit. feeling all the way back to my roots. To the caves. He turned his head and looked at us. His face was dark, but his eyeballs gave out sparks. He seemed to be positioned at the portal, bathed in prehistoric memories. B.D. had got most, if not all of it, which was fair, but sad. I did not eat my wife. What happened was, she kept a few chickens, and I ate one of those. He tried to make it an aggravating circumstance. Murderer. The idea of God disgusted me. Everybody yacked and blabbered about cosmic spirituality and Hindu yogic chakras and Zen koans.

During the festival of horrors, my cellmate, Strangler Bob, had evaporated. Now here he was, reconstituted full-length in his bed. never go back to jail. About fifteen years after all this, in the early nineteen-eighties, he hanged himself in a holding cell in Florida. A small, glittering rain would have perfected the picture, which was, all the same, as silent and remote and unattainable and sad as you could want. And very vague as to its meaning. I was kept there I wondered if this place was some kind of intersection for souls. B.D. and Dundun, in particular, turned up in my youth many times after this. I think they may have been not human beings but wayward angels. We consumed a lot of his stolen heroin while he outwaited his pursuers in my little apartment, and when he felt safe and went away he left me with a large quantity of the stuff, all mine, and over the course of the following month I became thoroughly addicted to heroin. My fate was sabotaged. Very often I sold my blood to buy wine. American critics and musicologists, searching for precedents, often reach back to Amy Beach (1867-1944), a superb professional who created a large and sturdy catalogue of late-Romantic music that compares well with that of her contemporaries. But the reasons for her limited output have everything to do with her gender, and are tragic. Instead, she turned her attention to collecting and publishing extant folk songs. David Stinson finished high school, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1977, the first thing he did was get a job building houses. After a few years, though, the business slowed. Stinson was then twenty-four, with two children to support. He needed something stable. As he explained over lunch recently, that meant finding a job at one of the two companies in the area that offered secure, blue-collar work. He has a full, reddish face, a thick head of silver hair, and a majestic midsection. The technology is really helping that kind of thing, too. Sandee, Jr., a sixty-four-year-old worker on the paint line, sat down next to Stinson with a carton of fries and a cup of ketchup, and tossed his safety goggles on the table. who has neatly combed gray hair and an alert, owlish face, began working at Steelcase in 1972, after waiting in line with six hundred people just to put in an application. the nineties, Steelcase employed more than ten thousand workers in the United States and operated seven factories around Grand Rapids, making chairs, filing cabinets, desks, and tables, and the screws, bolts, and casters that went into them. Packed shoulder to shoulder, workers polished and painted wood and assembled steel parts by hand. In total, they employ fewer than two thousand workers. history of Steelcase, in many ways, is the history of manufacturing in America. The company was founded in 1912 with one product, a fireproof metal wastebasket. By 2001, Steelcase had lost a third of its sales and started closing plants throughout western Michigan. Its manufacturing was moved to Mexico, China, and eventually India. In 2011, the company announced a new series of closings and layoffs, shutting another plant near Grand Rapids, one in Texas, and one in Ontario, Canada. days, as U.S. companies report record profits and demand millions of sleek new workspaces, Steelcase is again on the upswing. Its corporate headquarters, housed in a refurbished factory, is a laboratory of workplace trends, with open floor plans and glass-sheathed work pods where people recline with their laptops or hover at standing desks. There are automated assembly lines, and robotic arms lifting tabletops that were once hauled by men. Until last year, the plant workers had to consult a long list of steps, taking pains to remove the correct parts out of a cart filled with variously sized bolts and screws and pins and to insert each one in the correct hole and in the correct order. We stood behind a young woman wearing a polo shirt and Lycra shorts, with a long blond ponytail. A scanner overhead tracked everything as it was happening, beaming the data it collected to unseen engineers with iPads. Even the drill was attached to a computer-assisted arm; the worker just had to move it to the right position and let the machine do its magic. A decade ago, industrial robots assisted workers in their tasks. decades, the conventional view among economists was that technological advances create as many opportunities for workers as they take away. In the past several years, however, research has begun to suggest otherwise. process, Autor and other economists argue, can also exacerbate inequality. For people who have technical degrees and can manage automated systems, and for owners of companies that are in the process of automating, the potential for increased wealth is significant. In a paper from earlier this year, the economists Daron Acemoglu, of M.I.T., and Pascual Restrepo, of Boston University, studied local job markets in the United States between 1990 and 2007, and they found that the concentration of industrial robots in an area was directly related to a decline in jobs and in pay. Technology can compound the effects of globalization. By one measure, the average manufacturing worker in the United States earned nine per cent less in 2015 than the average worker in 1973, while the economy over all grew by two hundred per cent. Stinson nor Sandee thought that automation posed a threat to their jobs, though. Sandee remembers when Frank Merlotti, a legendary figure at Steelcase who retired as president and C.E.O. in 1990, used to visit the plant and deliver rousing speeches to the workers. He told me about a trip he had taken with his grandkids to New York City, where they had visited the Empire State Building. Building that building. Humans to Robots Laboratory, at Brown University, is on the ground floor of a red brick building in the center of Providence, Rhode Island. It has the feel of an oversized garage, filled with stained, lumpy sofas and scattered gadgets and toys, along with the odd takeout food carton. There, on a recent afternoon, a robot with bulky red arms set about pulling the petals from an artificial daisy. The robot, known around the lab as Winnie, held the flower in a pair of rubber-tipped pincers, then retracted its other arm, rotated it slightly, and pointed it down toward the daisy. It emitted an idling-motor sound, as though contemplating what to do next. Then the hand jerked down toward the flower, grabbed a petal, and flung it on the table. Even in highly automated factories, jobs that involve packing boxes or putting tiny parts together are done by people. In her class Topics in Collaborative Robotics, one student proposed to teach a robot to make a salad. industrial robot will pick up the same object, in the same location, over and over. The challenge, and the multibillion-dollar business opportunity, was to teach a robot to function in an environment that was constantly changing. Oberlin, another Ph.D. student, who wore a long brown ponytail, safety goggles, and sandals with wool socks, bent his tall frame over a computer on a side table. But these petals on this flower have more than one way to fall. Sometimes they can be rotated a little bit, sometimes they can droop, sometimes they can curve, so these petals are deformable. had retrofitted an artificial flower with little magnets on its petals, so that they could be reattached and reused. The cycle continued until there was only one petal left. moved in, its arm quivering slightly, and positioned its arm to the outside of the flower in a way that looked unlikely to succeed. The grippers opened, trying but failing to close around the petal. Then the arm pulled up again. Tellex said quietly, leaning against the window. She looked down at the table and the bare daisy stem. This is awesome. fruit and other produce, which involves hours under the hot sun, is the kind of job that Americans are increasingly reluctant to do and that often goes to low-paid immigrant labor. Yet the implications extend beyond agriculture. A robot that could efficiently pick blueberries could probably do a lot of things that are currently the exclusive province of human beings. Tellex said. Automation is a topic that gets treated with enormous diplomacy, both in Europe and in the United States. The Dutch supermarket chain Ahold Delhaize, which owns the Stop & Shop and Peapod grocery-store brands in the U.S., hopes to have all its retail outlets cleaned by robots within five years. He decided that the Danish hospital system, which was under pressure to reduce costs, could benefit from robotic orderlies. The machines worked well, scuttling through surgery wings and psych wards like helpful crabs, never complaining or taking cigarette breaks. If you do the math, you can have thirty-five robots for one human. So you might as well face reality and face facts. This is not entirely a misrepresentation. When I asked Dave Stinson and his colleagues at Steelcase about how automation had affected the assembly line, they said, for the most part, that it had made things easier. The factory was cleaner, less noisy, more productive. When something went wrong with the assembly, they could diagnose the problem swiftly, by consulting the data. work placed less stress on their bodies, too. At one time, twenty-five hundred steel tabletops came off the assembly line each day, requiring two men to sweat and strain to get each one into the right place; now a robotic arm with grippers moved the tops. Ergonomically, the difference today is huge. Now he could work longer without burning out, and the work was easier. The most immediate way that it makes manufacturing more efficient, of course, is by requiring fewer workers. Still, when manufacturing that has been sent overseas comes back, it brings some jobs back, too, even if they are not the same complement of jobs, and not in their old numbers. They belong to the Rodon Group, one of the largest family-owned injection-molding companies in the country. There were trade-offs with outsourcing: quality control was less reliable, and it was harder to respond nimbly to changing customer demands in the trend-driven toy business. Rodon laid off around forty people, about a third of its workforce. Araten said that when business picked up the discussion quickly turned to how the company could rehire those people. No people were visible. Most of the presses work twenty-four hours a day, drawing plastic resin into a hopper, heating it to six hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and then blasting the liquid into molds, which are enormous blocks of stainless steel, precision-fabricated in an adjacent tool shop to create the shape of the desired part. Automated arms lift the parts up to cool, before depositing them in boxes. The completed parts are bright orange, purple, and red, and resemble dime-store candies. Wilson is pale and thin, with glasses and a dark beard; he speaks in a low monotone, and gives the sense of someone who is more comfortable interacting with screens than with people. The child of two accountants, Wilson completed a mechanical-engineering degree at Philadelphia University in 2014, and said that he had sought out a manufacturing job where he could work directly with different types of automated machines. The Rodon Group had obliged. There was a time when a plant worker was dedicated to each press, shovelling in plastic polymers, pulling the cranks and pushing the buttons, and scooping out the finished products and loading them onto trucks. Now, Wilson explained, one operator manages between eight and ten presses, which are overseen by digital systems. As at Steelcase, the robots have reduced accidents. President Obama visited the Hatfield plant in 2012; Hillary Clinton stopped by in 2016. Our responsibility is, yes, to our shareholders but also to our employees, and to our community. acknowledged that, relative to sales, the Hatfield factory employed fewer people than it had done in the past. But the jobs that they do have and will have, he said, will be higher skilled and better paying. He argued that the government could encourage similar moves by other companies, through tax policy and major investments in education, while also preparing for the coming technological changes. Having so much inequality creates instability in a country. Maybe twenty years ago, we still had too many poor people, but they believed that they had a shot. As plants have closed, displaced employees have sought work in fast-food restaurants or in big-box retail stores, where the pay and the benefits are substantially less attractive. And, increasingly, even those jobs are fading away. Storefront retail is fast losing ground to the online marketplace. Meanwhile, companies like Uber and Google are investing heavily in autonomous-driving technology, betting that such vehicles will reshape transportation. In August, 2016, Uber purchased Otto, a startup based in San Francisco that sells technology designed to automate long-haul trucking. There are nearly two million long-distance truck drivers in the United States, most of whom are male and lack a college degree; paying for them accounts for a third of the costs in the seven-hundred-billion-dollar trucking industry. low-skilled workers, warehouse jobs have seemed to be something of a bright spot. the same factors that make warehouses a draw for labor have made them a tempting target for automation. In 2012, Amazon spent almost eight hundred million dollars to buy a robotics company called Kiva, which makes robots that can zoom around a factory floor and move tall stacks of shelves of up to seven hundred and fifty pounds in weight. A Deutsche Bank research report estimated that Amazon could save twenty-two million dollars a year by introducing the Kiva machines in a single warehouse; the savings company-wide could reach into the billions. With such a powerful incentive, Amazon is on a quest to acquire or develop systems that can replace human pickers. automating a legacy warehouse, however, is a halfway measure, as a visit to Symbotic makes clear. There are no aisles for lifts to pass through, and no stations for human product pickers. A fleet of little green robots that look like race cars in a Pixar film come to life and zoom inside the cage on dedicated tracks, emitting high-pitched whirring sounds. They collect the cases of products and stash them on shelves until they are needed. He is a muscular fellow with dirty-blond hair pulled back in a ponytail, and looks as if he could have had an alternate career leading tourists on spelunking trips through Belize. Cohen had wanted a system that would make his grocery warehouses more efficient; then he realized that he could make a business of selling it to other retailers. Symbotic says it now has more orders than it can swiftly fulfill. The automated system, Gahagan notes, produces more efficiencies than are obvious at first glance. Because it can store more products in a smaller space, companies could have more compact warehouses closer to their retail outlets, requiring less trucking. Many warehouse operators run their businesses based on labor hours, in order to minimize overtime pay, among other things. But an automated system could run twenty-four hours a day. That instantly puts pressure on competitors to follow suit. jobs in warehouses are undesirable and hard to fill, Gahagan assured me. A typical worker might lift thousands of pounds of goods each day and walk the equivalent of a marathon, five or six days a week. It could be freezing in the winter, and sweltering during the summer months. observed that technological innovation has been happening in one way or another for a hundred years. Tractors replaced manual plows, but we were now able to produce much more food, he said; A.T.M.s replaced tellers, but banks still employ hundreds of thousands of people. But the standard of living has gone up. walked onto a platform where we could see a track on which the mobile robots were lined up, waiting to be called into action. Occasionally, one of them would whirr its motor and blast off, like a little rocket. Gahagan looked down on his robot army with affection and awe. Gahagan had pointed out that other countries were embracing industrial robotics more aggressively than the United States was. I saw the scale of this during a recent trip to China. About half an hour later, I reached a vast, low building, where hundreds of bicycles were parked in a covered lot. Wong grew up in Beijing, studied electrical engineering at M.I.T., and worked at Bell Labs for fifteen years. He started C.I.G. in 2005, and says that the company produces between two and three million products each month. He quickly demonstrated the lack of sentimentality with which many businesspeople in China approach the subject of automation. C.I.G. is trying to replace as many human workers with robots as possible, he explained. Three or so years ago, the company had thirty-five hundred people at work in the factory. Two years ago, it was twenty-five hundred. Today, it is eighteen hundred. China was never a particularly convenient place for Western companies to have their sneakers and T-shirts and widgets made; the main allure was cheap labor. There was a labor shortage, he said, exacerbated by the longstanding one-child policy. And the employees seemed compliant. passed through a pressurized air lock that blasted away whatever dust or lint we had on our persons, and entered the clean part of the plant. Robotic arms, behind windows, were doing most of the work, while the mortals did tasks that required fine motor skills, like plugging tiny components into place. Every now and then, a cute little robotic trolley came ambling down an aisle, playing Mozart to alert the humans that it was approaching. (Until recently, most industrial robots were separated from human workers by steel cages, to protect the workers from injury. were thirteen people doing this. circuit boards continued down an automated conveyor belt. Other robots placed stickers on boxes, before a group of humans moved in to place the circuit boards in the boxes, along with packing materials. time I asked about what happened to the displaced workers, Hu and Wong waved away the question, amused at the predictable direction of my inquiries. Hu insisted that factory workers would simply find another place in the economy, such as the service sector. The world changes. back in the room with the surveillance monitors, Wong gave me a slide show on the history of industrial revolutions. The second phase, in 1900, saw the advent of electricity, and was centered in the U.S., the U.K., and Germany. The third was the information-technology revolution, beginning in 2000 and concentrated largely in the U.S., Germany, Japan, and Korea. Her father was an accountant; her mother taught second grade in downtown Rochester. Tellex became interested in computers as a child. Her father gave her an old DOS 486 when she was in grade school; her aunt, a programmer, supplied books of simple coding exercises. She completed her computer-science Ph.D. there in 2010. She told me that she had never thought about the political implications of her field until the tense months leading up to the 2016 Presidential election. Economic inequality was a driving theme of the election, and Tellex began to see that automation was a contributing factor. The economy was generating wealth, but almost all of it seemed to be going to the wealthy. 2015, the Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton identified a surprising data pattern that reflects these economic fault lines, finding that mortality rates for middle-aged white non-Hispanic Americans with only a high-school diploma have been increasing since the late nineteen-nineties. Deaton listed globalization, immigration, and technological change as likely factors behind the decline of middle-income workers and the related rise in inequality, but noted that, in the developed world, stagnant wages and an associated increase in death rates were unique to the United States. has been conducting her own research into the causes of income inequality and, with her friends, has amassed a reading list of academic studies and news articles. She is drawn to the idea of a universal basic income, in which citizens would receive enough money from the government to cover living expenses. Ultimately, she knows, blue-collar workers are not the only ones who may need such economic assistance. were ways, Tellex believed, to mitigate the effects of rising inequality without vilifying immigrants or blaming technology. It became a landmark of the Grand Rapids area; employees returning home from business trips would proudly make note of it as their flights descended into the Gerald R. Ford Airport. In 2009, in the midst of the financial crisis, Steelcase moved out of the building. It sat vacant until 2016, when a company called Switch moved in. Stinson, at Steelcase, told me that he often became emotional when he saw the building, and was reminded of what it represented. There was talk that they were going to tear it down. Bill Sandee, his colleague, tries to put those losses in perspective. And the company has to do something to survive. He paused. The night before the election, he and his wife attended a Trump rally in Grand Rapids, in the heart of a state that Hillary Clinton had expected to win comfortably. More than four thousand people lined up for blocks to hear Trump at a downtown convention center. Stinson said he decided that night to vote for the Republican ticket. was accustomed to politicians disappointing him. Stinson used to spend his days reminding workers of what they were supposed to be doing, or trying to figure out how faulty parts had sneaked into the system. He used to jump in and demonstrate precisely how a screw was supposed to go in, or whether the torque was correct. Now none of that was necessary. Automated machines were driving everything. No longer. The crews are thin; the pressure is less. The youngest of his three sons, aged thirty, works in a different department at the Steelcase plant. says he is, too. When I asked how many new workers Steelcase had hired to accommodate the increase in production, he said that workers were mainly being moved between production lines, to replace workers who had retired. gazed out at the smoothly functioning factory floor, the rows of machines diving and pecking in front of their human minders, performing a kind of dance. Even if the economy stayed strong and demand remained high the head count was expected to decline through attrition, year after year. One day, the factory might go dark.

I trained to be a doctor, some four decades ago, everyone neglected sleep. and lasted twenty-four hours; I often kept on working until early evening the next day, after which I would stumble back to my apartment and fall asleep in my clothes. The ethic was not to complain. In medical school, the subject had been covered in only the most cursory way. In a class on the brain, an instructor mentioned a neural pathway, the reticular activating system, that was associated with wakefulness. In passing, he also told us about narcolepsy, a rare condition that could cause people to sink into slumber at any moment and that had other fascinating features, such as vivid hallucinations and abrupt loss of muscle control. That was it. Sleep medicine has become a specialty, with fellowship training programs and clinics devoted to caring for those suffering from sleep disorders. And these disorders are not rare. In the workplace, sleep deprivation results in injuries and decreased productivity, which is thought to cost the U.S. eighteen billion dollars each year. numbers have not escaped the notice of the business world, and there is now a thriving sleep industry. Pharmaceutical companies ply us with Ambien and Lunesta, and entrepreneurs have devised any number of outlandish gadgets to foster slumber. Still, although we may know more about sleep than ever before, it remains one of the most enigmatic phenomena in our daily lives. Kryger, a professor at Yale Medical School, is a leader in the field of sleep medicine, and has treated more than thirty thousand patients with sleep problems during a career that spans four decades. He draws on this voluminous clinical experience in his book, which is an authoritative and accessible survey of what is known, what is believed, and what is still obscure about normal patterns of sleep and the conditions that disrupt it. hyperactive imagination produced hundreds of bizarre characters. In the nineteen-fifties, some researchers were reminded of Joe when they studied an obese amateur poker player who had fallen asleep in the middle of a game. We now know that being very overweight can prevent people from breathing deeply enough and quickly enough to keep themselves supplied with oxygen. Apnea can lead to heart attack and stroke from decreased oxygen, and may accelerate cognitive decline in older people. Dionysius, a tyrant who ruled the Cretan kingdom of Heraclea in the fourth century B.C., was massively overweight. Because he repeatedly fell asleep, Dionysius hired people to poke him with long, thin needles, probably to keep him breathing. Once it had been demonstrated that certain conditions associated with disrupted sleep could have dire clinical consequences, it became clear that sleep was a crucial factor in maintaining good health. book usefully outlines the current state of knowledge of sleep science in humans. The biology of sleep and wakefulness is complex, involving not just the one neural circuit I learned about in medical school but numerous pathways in the brain and countless chemical mediators. The gauge begins to signal after we have been awake for about fourteen hours, and increases in intensity until the eighteen-hour mark, after which we find it hard not to fall asleep. The wake gauge operates in the brain by means of a chemical called adenosine, which is involved in energy transfer. The longer our brain is active, the more adenosine accumulates and the sleepier we feel. body clock synchronizes our need for sleep with the rhythms of the world around us. Daylight is the primary regulator. At dusk, when light fades, the pineal gland (where Descartes believed the soul resided) releases melatonin and makes us drowsy. Melatonin regulates the circadian rhythm of a wide range of organisms; the molecule is found in bacteria, insects, jellyfish, and plants. By tracking eye movements and using electroencephalograms to measure brain waves, researchers have identified four main types of sleep and have established that we typically progress through them in cycles of about ninety minutes. During this phase, almost all of our muscles are paralyzed, except the diaphragm, which allows us to continue to breathe, and certain sphincters at the top and bottom of our gastrointestinal tract. All humans dream, usually three to five times a night. And every time a man dreams he has an erection; every time a woman dreams, the blood vessels of her vagina become engorged. These changes in our genitalia are apparently unrelated to sexual thoughts before sleep or to sexual content in the dreams themselves. offers a comprehensive analysis of physical conditions that can impair our sleep. Women may experience insomnia owing to the normal hormonal fluctuations of the menstrual cycle and to the changes in hormonal regulation that occur with menopause. Restless-leg syndrome, which causes lower limbs to spontaneously move and often cramp, is associated with certain vitamin deficiencies but often occurs without a known reason. for most of us it is the mind, rather than the body, that disrupts restorative sleep. Kryger explores in depth psychological conditions that are associated with disordered sleep, as well as psychotropic medications whose side effects can prevent a restful night. Kryger explains the difference between flying east and flying west. He recommends avoiding sleep for more than a short nap. mysteries that surround sleep are not merely scientific and clinical but also cultural. In some indigenous societies in Nigeria, Central America, and Brazil, segmented sleep persisted into the twentieth century. Ekirch hypothesized that segmented sleep was our natural, evolutionary heritage, and that it had been disrupted in the West by the demands of industrialization, and by electricity, which made artificial lighting ubiquitous. other studies cited by Reiss challenge the idea of a universal model of sleep across millennia. Jerome Siegel, a neuroscientist at U.C.L.A., studied three contemporary hunter-gatherer societies in Tanzania, Namibia, and Bolivia. None of the tribes experienced segmented sleep, but daytime naps were important, especially during the summer months. industrialization, sleep patterns were based largely on seasonal daylight. But the idea that modern industrial society alone is responsible for our discordant forms of sleep is belied by the taxing rhythms of agrarian life. Harvests required long days and late nights; cows would have been milked in the very early mornings, and shepherds, as the hymn says, watched their flocks by night, to save them from predators. Speaking of hymns, Reiss also ignores the demands that religious rituals have long made on daily schedules. In Judaism, there are three services for prayer: morning, afternoon, and night. In Islam, the muezzin calls the faithful to prayer five times a day, beginning at dawn. Thoreau suffered from insomnia, and his retreat, in 1845, to a simple cabin at Walden Pond was, in part, driven by a desperate need for rest. Thoreau attributed his nightly struggles to the fact that railroads and other industrial changes had disturbed the natural environment around Concord. The history of blaming modernity for lost sleep runs long. Where Thoreau once held railroads responsible for his insomnia, we now obsess over e-mail and social media and the glowing screens of our computers and smartphones. Societies have been looking for ways of forcing people to rest since at least the Iron Age, when the Sabbath tradition emerged in Judaism. As Kryger shows, sleep is utterly essential to life, organically speaking, but the act of living our lives to the fullest, with all the attendant toils, responsibilities, and worries, has probably always been the enemy of sleep. Groopman, a staff writer since 1998, writes primarily about medicine and biology. He holds the Dina and Raphael Recanati Chair of Medicine at the Harvard Medical School and is the chief of experimental medicine at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His research has focussed on the basic mechanisms of cancer and AIDS. He has been a major participant in the development of many AIDS-related therapies, including protease inhibitors, and he is active in regional and national education activities in AIDS and cancer medicine, as well as in the training and education of young scientists in these fields. Recently, he has extended the research infrastructure in genetics and cell biology to studies in lymphoma, myelodysplasia, and leukemia. He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies. Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 is perhaps the single most frequently mocked act of Congress in history. It sparked a trade war in the early days of the Great Depression, and has become shorthand for self-destructive protectionism. decision is more than a throwback. Probably not, but now you can. this is just the early, land-rush phase of the Internet of Things, comparable to the first Internet land rush, in the late nineties. For most of its existence, Amazon has made little or no profit. Amazon can calculate this with increasing accuracy. Already, it likely knows which books you read, which movies you watch, what data you store, and what food you eat. In the old days, you might buy a washing machine or a refrigerator once a decade or so. Appliance-makers are built to profit from that one, rare purchase, focussing their marketing, customer research, and internal financial analysis on brief, sporadic, high-stakes interactions. But, when an appliance is sending a constant stream of data back to its maker, that company has continuous relationships with the owners of its products, and can find all sorts of ways to make money from those relationships. If a company knows, years after you bought its stove, exactly how often you cook, what you cook, when you shop, and what you watch (on a stove-top screen) while you cook, it can continuously monetize your relationship: selling you recipe subscriptions, maybe, or getting a cut of your food orders. Appliances now order their own supplies when they are about to run out. makes smart appliances, just like Samsung and LG. Maybe they should put their resources into serving their consumers better. But most of the tariffs were small and easy for the companies to get around. President Trump, of course, views free trade more skeptically, and may well impose huge tariffs on all laundry-machine imports. Irwin suspects that this will produce a flood of trade-protection complaints from other American firms. Moretti, playing himself, depicts his failed effort to make an anti-Berlusconi documentary. Hoover was the son of devout Quakers who lived in the frontier village of West Branch, Iowa. His father, a blacksmith, died when Herbert was six, and his mother died three years later. At the age of eleven, he was sent, by train, along a just completed rail line, to a small settlement in Oregon, to live with an uncle, who treated him coldly and loaded him down with chores. By early middle age, he was a celebrated international hero. The times demanded industrial-scale achievements, not limited to industry itself; Hoover was a public-service superman, a mega-bureaucrat. Nobody demonstrates this better than Hoover. Four years later, he got fifty-nine electoral votes and carried just six states. What intervened between his two Presidential runs was the 1929 stock-market crash and the early years of the Great Depression. Hoover was doomed to be remembered as the man who was too rigidly conservative to react adeptly to the Depression, as the hapless foil to the great Franklin Roosevelt, and as the politician who managed to turn a Republican country into a Democratic one. An inaugural graduate of Stanford, where he studied mechanical engineering and geology, Hoover became a mining engineer at a time when that was as glamorous and potentially profitable a career as launching a tech startup would be for a Stanford graduate now. Before he turned thirty, he was married and a father, running a large gold mine in Tientsin, China, and highly prosperous. Hoover seems to have been an almost brutally tough, obsessively hardworking manager; certainly charm was not the secret to his success. He soon broke with his employers and struck out on his own, mainly as a financier of mining projects, rather than as a manager of them, and did very well for himself. The Hoovers moved to London and lived in a large town house. That is, if one had the means to take part in its upper life. It was also the period in which a good deal of the familiar institutional architecture of the United States was created: big corporations and universities, the first government regulatory agencies, structured and licensed professions, charitable foundations, think tanks. Liberal intellectuals like Walter Lippmann and Herbert Croly saw the establishment of a class of trained, technocratic experts as essential to the future of democracy. In business, efficiency experts like Frederick Winslow Taylor and Frank Gilbreth systematized the operations of industrial mass production, down to the physical movements of workers on an assembly line. Psychologists like Lewis Terman invented tests that could be used to sort the population en masse. Hoover was a creature of the engineering division of this milieu. Then it moves to realization in stone or metal or energy. Then it brings jobs and homes to men. Then it elevates the standard of living and adds to the comforts of life. Unless the subject is a monster, all that intimacy typically turns the biographer into a personal partisan. This did not happen with Whyte and Hoover. Biographers want psychological access, but Hoover, though the records he left behind are vast, has the quality of not being personally present in a life that, for a long while, produced one triumph after another. gave him renown enough to make him a plausible Presidential candidate was his self-appointment as the manager of an international effort to get food into Belgium after it had fallen to the Germans during the First World War. Whatever qualities had made Hoover successful as an operator of mines in remote areas also made him successful at delivering relief under emergency conditions. He borrowed money to buy food before he had succeeded in getting government assistance. He persuaded George Bernard Shaw, Thomas Hardy, and other leading authors to publish statements in support of his efforts. He negotiated with food brokers and shipping companies. At a time when the world adored people who had spectacular organizational skills, here was somebody using them not to build a factory or administer an empire but for purely humanitarian purposes. 1917, after many years in London, Hoover returned to the United States, won the friendship and admiration of President Woodrow Wilson, and was made the director of a new government agency called the United States Food Administration, which was charged with managing the national food supply now that the country was a participant in the war. This was another widely publicized triumph: the troops abroad and the folks back home were well and reliably fed. He wound up not entering the race, but he eventually declared himself a Republican and was appointed Secretary of Commerce by President Warren Harding. those days, Hoover was, Whyte observes, on the liberal edge of the Republican Party. He also loved taking on projects like standardizing the sizes of bricks and wood screws. As early as 1923, Hoover was warning publicly that, sooner or later, the booming economy of the nineteen-twenties was going to go bust. In the early months of his Presidency, he began selling his own stocks in anticipation of a crash. And when the crash came, on October 29, 1929, Hoover immediately grasped its importance and began exploring what to most of Washington seemed like the outer acceptable limit of an aggressive government response to an economic crisis. launched infrastructure-building projects unprecedented in scale. Convinced that the heavy reparations payments imposed on Germany after the First World War were making the Depression more severe in Europe, he organized a politically risky moratorium on them. The atmosphere surrounding these activities was typically Hooverian: he confronted the Depression the way he had the humanitarian crises that brought him to the Presidency, with sheer hard work. Surrounded by a circle of loyal aides who had served him for decades and who were known collectively as the Firm, he apportioned his long days at the office (he was the first President to keep a telephone on his desk) into series of eight-minute appointments. The coming of the New Deal turned most Republican Progressives into conservatives, though, and none more than Hoover. Like many politicians, Hoover preferred to think of himself as someone who had reluctantly answered a call to public service, rather than as someone who craved power, but he took losing very hard. As the rise of Adolf Hitler forced Roosevelt to become a foreign-policy President, Hoover began to disapprove of him diplomatically just as much as he did economically. He believed that, if left alone, Hitler, whom he had visited in 1938, would direct his ambitions eastward and wage a mutually destructive war with the Soviet Union, leaving Britain and Western Europe alone. He used this as an occasion to reprise his decades-past role as a one-man food-distribution tsar in postwar Europe. The following year, a newly Republican Congress put him in charge of a vast efficiency study of the federal government. The Hoover Commission, run with typically obsessive thoroughness by its septuagenarian namesake, produced nineteen separate reports and two hundred and seventy-three recommendations. unlikely that any President elected in 1928, even Roosevelt, would have been returned to office in 1932. The magnitude of the economic disaster was just too great to be politically survivable. In fact, when Roosevelt took office the unemployment rate was at its all-time historical peak, twenty-five per cent, and the entire American banking system had stopped functioning. Even if Hoover had been able to devise a perfect plan for surmounting the disaster, his lack of political skills would have prevented him from enacting it. Hoover set out to govern in the manner in which he had accomplished the spectacular feats that had brought him to the Presidency: as an administrator of genius. He tried to defeat the Depression by grinding it down from behind his desk. He had been raised in a strict teetotalling environment. It concerned the size and the scope of the federal government. Roosevelt created the Works Projects Administration, Social Security, and other programs that conferred benefits directly on people in need. Roosevelt had more than doubled that figure even before the Second World War began. By the time of his death, it was twenty per cent, where it would roughly hover for the next seven decades. Roosevelt increased the number of federal employees from about five hundred thousand to more than six million. Hoover believed that a small central government was the only possible distinctively American alternative to Socialism, Communism, and Fascism. loyal aides to Roosevelt found him maddening. He used his charm as an aid to elusiveness. Everybody left a meeting with Roosevelt believing he had agreed to whatever the person had asked for. Nobody could figure out exactly what he thought. He encouraged rivalries and overlapping responsibilities. The man who was a trusted family member to Americans who listened to him on the radio was unknowable to the people in his immediate vicinity. Hoover, though by no means open, was always forthright, and he inspired intense loyalty among those who worked for him. He pointed to the sofa and chuckled. He patted his belly. They belonged to the People, the Party, the collective. He shook his head. apartment required one final touch. He picked up a swath of gold sheeting that was so shiny he could see his face in it, and began wrapping the sofa, Christo style. Xu stepped back. silver sheeting turned out to be too narrow to cover the double bed. Two art handlers with walkie-talkies arrived to troubleshoot; it was decided that the Mylar would be cut and re-sewn, to the right dimensions. A tattooed assistant named Sonia grabbed a pair of scissors and began snipping. up, Xu gazed at the tub. Alexander had a busy stage career in the years before George Costanza. He was cast anyway, which meant working with the mercurial Robbins, who was directing his own self-tribute. (The Manhattan Theatre Club production opens Oct. 24, at City Center Stage I.) Alexander plays a lawyer in Providence, Rhode Island, dealing with an overbearing mother (Mary Testa), a sexy Greek widow with a past (Sherie Rene Scott), and his own high anxiety. A starry cast, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright: Alexander knows from experience not to rest on pedigree. Weinstein combined a keen eye for promising scripts, directors, and actors with a bullying, even threatening, style of doing business, inspiring both fear and gratitude. Too few people were willing to speak, much less allow a reporter to use their names, and Weinstein and his associates used nondisclosure agreements, payoffs, and legal threats to suppress their accounts. story, however, is complex, and there is more to know and to understand. In the course of a ten-month investigation, I was told by thirteen women that, between the nineteen-nineties and 2015, Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them. Four women said that they had experienced unwanted touching that could be classified as an assault. They and others described a pattern of professional meetings that were little more than thin pretexts for sexual advances on young actresses and models. All sixteen said that the behavior was widely known within both Miramax and the Weinstein Company. Some employees said that they were enlisted in a subterfuge to make the victims feel safe. all of the people I spoke with told me that they were frightened of retaliation. Multiple sources said that Weinstein frequently bragged about planting items in media outlets about those who spoke against him; these sources feared similar retribution. likely that the women who spoke to me have recently felt increasingly emboldened to talk about their experiences because of the way the world has changed regarding issues of sex and power. Ailes, the former head of Fox News, resigned in July, 2016, after he was accused of sexual harassment. Cosby went on trial this summer, charged with drugging and sexually assaulting a woman. Hofmeister, a spokesperson for Weinstein, issued a new statement in response to the allegations detailed here. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path. Stoller, now Lucia Evans, was approached by Weinstein at Cipriani Upstairs, a club in New York, in 2004, the summer before her senior year at Middlebury College. Evans, who is now a marketing consultant, wanted to be an actress, and although she had heard rumors about Weinstein she let him have her number. Weinstein began calling her late at night, or having an assistant call her, asking to meet. She declined, but said that she would do readings during the day for a casting executive. Before long, an assistant called to set up a daytime meeting at the Miramax office in Tribeca, first with Weinstein and then with a casting executive, who was a woman. Evans arrived for the meeting, the building was full of people. She was led to an office with exercise equipment in it, and takeout boxes on the floor. Weinstein was there, alone. Evans said that she found him frightening. As she objected, Weinstein took his penis out of his pants and pulled her head down onto it. appeared to find the encounter unremarkable. Afterward, he acted as if nothing had happened. Weinstein, Evans said, began calling her again late at night. She told me that the entire sequence of events had a routine quality. Everything was designed to make me feel comfortable before it happened. She continued to blame herself for not fighting harder. I was disgusted with myself. Evans told friends some of what had happened, but felt largely unable to talk about it. Once, while she was walking her dog in Greenwich Village, she saw him getting into a car. I was so horrified. The distributor was Miramax. the time, Argento was twenty-one and had twice won the Italian equivalent of the Oscar. Argento felt professionally obliged to attend. At first, Weinstein was solicitous, praising her work. Then he left the room. When he returned, he was wearing a bathrobe and holding a bottle of lotion. some point, she stopped saying no and feigned enjoyment, because she thought it was the only way the assault would end. A big fat man wanting to eat you. Decades later, she said, oral sex is still ruined for her. He said he would put the phrase on a T-shirt. Weinstein dined with her, and introduced her to his mother. Years later, when she was a single mother dealing with childcare, Weinstein offered to pay for a nanny. told me that she knew this contact would be used to attack the credibility of her allegation. In part, she said, the initial assault made her feel overpowered each time she encountered Weinstein, even years later. She broke down as she struggled to explain. In the film, a heavyset producer corners Anna, the character played by Argento, in a hotel room, asks her for a massage, and tries to assault her. women were too afraid to allow me to use their names, but their stories are uncannily similar to these allegations. One, a woman who worked with Weinstein, explained her reluctance to be identified. She told him no, repeatedly and clearly. The woman continued to have professional contact with Weinstein after the alleged rape, and acknowledged that subsequent communications between them might suggest a normal working relationship. She scrambled for ways to ward him off, telling him that it was against her religion to date married men. few weeks later, in New York City, her phone rang after midnight. It was Weinstein, saying that he had new marketing ideas for the film and asking to get together. Sorvino offered to meet him at an all-night diner, but he said he was coming over to her apartment and hung up. She called a friend and asked him to come over and pose as her boyfriend. (Dix told me that she had locked herself in a hotel bathroom to escape Weinstein, and that he had masturbated in front of her. She had professional contact with Weinstein for years after the incident, and remains a close friend of his brother and business partner, Bob Weinstein. In the office, she sat with Weinstein on a couch to review the portfolio, and he began staring at her breasts, asking if they were real. Weinstein telephoned her later that evening, annoyed that she had failed to appear at the show. She picked up the call while sitting with investigators from the Special Victims Division, who listened in and devised a plan: Gutierrez would agree to see the show the following day and then meet with Weinstein. next day, Gutierrez met Weinstein at the bar of the Tribeca Grand Hotel. A team of undercover officers helped guide her through the interaction. On the recording, which I have heard in full, Weinstein lists actresses whose careers he has helped and offers Gutierrez the services of a dialect coach. Then he presses her to join him in his hotel room while he showers. Gutierrez says no repeatedly; Weinstein persists, and after a while she accedes to his demand to go upstairs. But, standing in the hallway outside his room, she refuses to go farther. In an increasingly tense exchange, he presses her to enter. Come on. Weinstein says. to a law-enforcement source, Weinstein, if charged, would most likely have faced a count of sexual abuse in the third degree, a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of three months in jail. She claimed that she had been unaware of the nature of the party before arriving, and she eventually became a witness in a bribery case against Berlusconi, which is still ongoing. One of them, a police source, said that the department had collected more than enough evidence to prosecute Weinstein. when contacted for this story, said that she was unable to discuss the incident. Nestor was twenty-five when she started the job and, after finishing law school and starting business school, was considering a career in the movie industry. told her to meet him for drinks that night. Nestor invented an excuse. He did, and told her to meet him at the Peninsula hotel in Beverly Hills, where he was staying. After Weinstein offered her career help, she said, he began to boast about his sexual liaisons with other women, including famous actresses. He asked to hold her hand; she said no. She recalled refusing his advances at least a dozen times. Afterward, Weinstein told Nestor to keep an eye on the news cycle, which he promised would be spun in his favor. And I knew how well connected he was. That was common knowledge across the board. told me that some people at the company did seem concerned. Irwin Reiter, a senior executive who had worked for Weinstein for almost three decades, sent her a series of messages via LinkedIn. (Reiter declined to comment for this article, but his lawyer, Debra Katz, confirmed the authenticity of the messages and said that Reiter had made diligent efforts to raise these issues, to no avail. no assault occurred, and Nestor left after completing her temporary placement, she was profoundly affected by the experience. In the meeting, Weinstein told de Caunes that he was going to be producing a movie with a prominent director, that he planned to shoot it in France, and that it had a strong female role. Weinstein pleaded with her to retrieve the book with him, and finally she agreed. As they got to his room, she received a telephone call from one of her colleagues, and Weinstein disappeared into a bathroom, leaving the door open. Weinstein came out, naked and with an erection. De Caunes told Weinstein that she was leaving, and he panicked. she remembered him saying. And then I left. She was shaking on the stairs going down to the lobby. A director she was working with on the TV show confirmed that she arrived at the studio distraught and that she recounted what had happened. Caunes, who was in her early thirties at the time, was already an established actress, but she wondered what would happen to younger and more vulnerable women in the same situation. evening in the early nineties, the actress Rosanna Arquette was supposed to meet Weinstein for dinner at the Beverly Hills Hotel to pick up the script for a new film. recalled that, when she arrived at the room, Weinstein opened the door wearing a white bathrobe. He said that his neck was sore and that he needed a massage. She told him that she could recommend a good masseuse. He put it on his neck. When she yanked her hand away, Weinstein grabbed it again and pulled it toward his penis, which was visible and erect. told her that she was making a huge mistake by rejecting him, and named an actress and a model who he claimed had given in to his sexual overtures and whose careers he said he had advanced as a result. In one case, she believes, she lost a role because of it. Jessica Barth, an actress who met him at a Golden Globes party in January, 2011, told me that he invited her to a business meeting at the Peninsula. When she arrived, he asked her over the phone to go up to his room. behavior deeply affected the day-to-day operations of his companies. Current and former employees described a pattern of meetings and strained complicity that closely matches the accounts of the many women I interviewed. executive said that she was especially disturbed by the involvement of other employees. former employee told me that she was frequently asked to join for the beginning of meetings that, she said, had in many cases already been moved from day to night and from hotel lobbies to hotel rooms. She said that when she refused to join one such meeting, Weinstein became enraged. She added that the pattern of meetings was nearly uninterrupted in her years of working for Weinstein. staffers who facilitated these meetings said that they felt morally compromised by them. He told me that most of the encounters that he saw seemed consensual, but others gave him pause. and his legal and public-relations teams have conducted a decades-long campaign to suppress these stories. In recent months, that campaign escalated. Weinstein and his associates began calling many of the women in this article. Weinstein asked Argento to meet with a private investigator and give testimony on his behalf. One actress who initially spoke to me on the record later asked that her allegation be removed from this piece. These employees continued to participate in the article partly because they felt that there was a growing culture of accountability, embodied in the relatively recent disclosures about high-profile men such as Cosby and Ailes. female executive who declined inappropriate meetings told me that her lawyer advised her that she could be liable for hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages for violating the nondisclosure agreement attached to her employment contract. I wish I could have stopped it. happy families are alike. is afoot in the Meyerowitz clan. Eliza, the sanest and the most poised of them, will soon be heading to Bard for freshman year. The Whitney, which bought a piece of his, appears to have lost it. Bard, where he taught for a time, may mount a retrospective of his work, though only as part of a group show: clearly an insult, for an artist whose regal insultability is perhaps his proudest achievement. All in all, a charming fellow. Grace Van Patten, who is twenty, holds her own in style amid the starry names. The two of them bristle and spar, coming to blows in one of the least manly bouts of combat ever staged, which results in a very minor nosebleed. For all the horseplay, what matters most is that we actually believe in Danny, Matthew, and Jean as siblings. Though tugged apart by force of circumstance, they are bound by a history of shared jokes and unamusing pain. Danny and Matthew, reluctant to assault a fragile man, decide to trash his car instead. The dilemmas that it grapples with, involving parents and their frustrated offspring, could not be less parochial. One clever shot, tracking Harold and Matthew along a street, mid-argument, glides from left to right and back again as if on the sideline of a soccer field; their antagonism, we realize, is an established sport. Yikes. She comes in hope. First, we have Ben (Oakes Fegley), living in Gunflint, Minnesota, with his aunt. His mother died in an accident, and he barely knows who his father was, but he takes a bus to New York, alone, to learn more. All of this happens in 1977, in sweltering color, whereas the adventures of the second child, Rose (Millicent Simmonds), unfold half a century before, in black-and-white. Then, there is the sound of silence. Ben loses his hearing (after being struck by lightning, if you please) but he can still speak, whereas Rose is both deaf and mute. She radiates an eager sympathy, in her sign language and in the unguarded warmth of expression on her face. In 2001, his reviews received the National Magazine Award for Reviews and Criticism. His yearning was not foreseeable at his birth: his father was a hippie and his mother was an ex-nun, and they had met while counselling draft resisters during the Vietnam War. Jofie discovered golf as a child, when his mother began dropping him off at a local public course early on summer mornings and picking him up late in the afternoon, hoping to give him something inexpensive to do that would last all day. Quite a few of his clients are well known. I did Kenneth Cole. I did the floating green at GlenArbor Golf Club, in Bedford. I did two soccer fields at Greenwich Country Day School. laughed. basement greens. hollered instructions from above, and two helpers arranged fringe pieces around the perimeter of the putting surface, which was slightly kidney-shaped. Still, he said, he was pleased with the result. These include excellent octopus croquettes, a couple luscious little slices of Wagyu beef, and Not Ramen, which actually is ramen. The Black Truffle Explosion, a dish that made Achatz famous early on, at Trio in Evanston, Illinois, is here a single raviolo, enclosing a deeply truffled liquid. In fact, the landmark agreement capitalized on a rare consensus. After years of hesitating, China and Russia joined the other permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, along with Germany and the European Union, in supporting American pressure on Iran to change course. But the effect on its nuclear program was unquestionable. In return for the removal of sanctions imposed by the United States and other nations, which had crippled its economy, Iran agreed to shut down facilities and to give broad access to inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency. By early October, the White House had devised a plan to assuage his anger. If hawks in Congress push through a law demanding further concessions, it could provoke Iran to abandon the deal, eject the inspectors, and accelerate its nuclear program. a deal that Americans conceived, brokered, and secured would undercut decades of U.S. leadership on non-proliferation. that, during a Pentagon briefing, Trump called for a nearly tenfold increase in the nuclear arsenal. reflexive pursuit of manufactured conflict is becoming unbearable even to some of his most loyal erstwhile allies. It would open a rift with China just as it is weighing whether to join the United States again, this time in negotiating with North Korea. A decision to undermine the signature foreign-policy deal of a previous Administration would tilt the balance away from North Korean officials who argue for compromise. During the Cuban missile crisis, in 1962, President John F. Kennedy dispatched former Secretary of State Dean Acheson to Paris to inform President Charles de Gaulle that the Administration had decided to stage a naval blockade of Cuba. fierce critics of Tehran called the agreement vital to international security. Crowded with twentysomething Harlemites on the quietest of evenings, the Edge serves wine and sweet punch to a reggae and jazz soundtrack. A hibiscus mimosa is a Hudson River sunset in a glass. while, nearby, a professorial type held forth on an issue of Byzantine complexity, the topic unclear. Steem fish.

Life was going nowhere, and it had been that way as long as he could remember. After that conversation with his friend, Alexander Good Cane Milk quit his job, said goodbye to his girlfriend, and drove up to the protest camp, just outside the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Living at camp and meeting people from different changed him, he said. He even took on a new name: Topa, the number four in the Dakota language. He stood on the front lines, facing the security guards and the police. He stood with members of the Crow Nation, once bitter enemies of his people, now allies in this battle. He was a warrior, he says. A water protector. Now, that fire has spread. Indigenous people are battling a pipeline in British Columbia. Others are standing up to pipelines in Louisiana and Virginia. And Topa is still fighting pipelines, in Wisconsin and Minnesota, nearly two years after Standing Rock. In this episode of Rivers of Oil, we'll take a look at why pipelines have become such a potent issue for so many Native American and indigenous people. But this isn't just a story about culture and identity. Treuer has written several other books, including a history of the Red Lake Nation in Minnesota. In an hourlong radio special, reporters dove into the protest's focus on oil, water, race and treaty rights. Eventually, the Red Lake tribal council voted to remove the pipelines from its land.

They spent the night after authorities arrested approximately 10 people yesterday following an evacuation order by Governor Doug Burgum. The 17-year-old was airlifted to Minneapolis to treat her burns. These ceremonial burnings were a sign of respect for tribal elders, according to Indigenous Rising Media.

DAPL would transport 570,000 barrels of crude oil a day across the Missouri River, less than a mile upstream from Standing Rock Sioux territory. The construction of the pipeline has desecrated Sioux historical and sacred sites and the pipeline itself would put the drinking water of 18 million people at risk of contamination. This pipeline was originally routed through Bismarck, a predominantly white community, but due to concerns around drinking water contamination, it was re-routed to travel just upstream of Sioux territory. Thousands of indigenous people and allies gathered at the Oceti Sakowin and Sacred Stone Camps to stop the construction of the pipeline. Although their protest was peaceful, they were abused by law enforcement officials. Militarized police unleashed dogs on peaceful protesters. They detained protesters in dog kennels and used tear gas, rubber bullets, and strip searches to intimidate and humiliate. On November 21, The Guardian reported that over 300 protesters had been injured after police deployed water cannons in freezing temperatures. The United Nations and Amnesty International have both condemned the ongoing human rights abuses at Standing Rock. Given the injustices faced by Indigenous peoples in Standing Rock today, it is imperative that Intesa SanPaolo live up to its commitments and show leadership in defending social justice. We ask you to follow these examples and divest from a project that tramples the rights of sovereign nations and endangers the environment. We ask Intesa SanPaolo to live up to its commitments to the environment and human rights by issuing a public statement to denounce the human rights violations taking place at Standing Rock and to withdraw its investments from the pipeline.

Thousands of them. Native Americans and military veterans. Environmentalists. Police from nine states. Movie stars. Cattle ranchers and lumberjacks, college students and nurses, landscapers, investment bankers and a waitress from a Florida restaurant called Smokey Bones. All have been drawn by a 30-inch steel pipe that, in the unlikely setting of a desolate North Dakota prairie, has become a powerful symbol of heritage and history, progress and oppression, indigenous rights and corporate might. Walking and working the land, each brings a personal history and set of values to a conflict many see as pitting sovereign rights against corporate might. It is more than 90 percent complete. Now, nearly 2,000 are living in tents, tepees, yurts, RVs and cars. They are native and non-native, elderly and newborns. The camp has become so large and permanent that it has a book-swap library and a medical center. More than 560 people have been arrested in protests that have spread 40 miles north to the capital, Bismarck. Each side blames the other for the increasing violence. Protesters claim police have brutalized them with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, concussion grenades and water cannons. North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) and the Army Corps of Engineers have ordered protesters out of the camp, but they vow to remain. With the first snows of a bleak North Dakota winter threatening, The Washington Post visited the area to record the personal accounts of people on all sides of an issue that is tearing at the American heartland. In Native American culture, dreams can be prophetic. The black snake in this case, he said, is a pipeline filled with oil. On a cold November morning, Goldtooth sat next to a warm wood stove in a canvas tent and described the struggle in flowing indigenous imagery: the four cycles of life, the sacred hoop and the importance of circles in nature, the spiritual power of eagles and grizzly bears. Then his words turned sledgehammer blunt. Goldtooth sees the pipeline as a threat to the drinking water of thousands downstream. Goldtooth was raised on a Navajo reservation in New Mexico, the grandson of a tribal medicine man and the son of a pioneering Navajo woman who earned a college degree in microbiology. Now he travels the world speaking about climate change, energy, pollution and sustainable resources. Goldtooth lives in Minnesota but has been coming to Standing Rock to visit relatives since he was a young man. He has become a key face of the movement here, and one recent morning he nodded as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist and lawyer, visited and likened the pipeline encampment to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The same day, Goldtooth stood in an empty field amid a circle of volunteer architects, engineers and builders who had come from as far as Spokane, Wash., and Santa Fe, N.M., to help build a more permanent camp to ride out the bone-cracking winter.

But one young man suddenly tried to push his way through the line of riot police, who threw him to the ground and cuffed him. over and over and spat at the officers. Bryson shook his head. To him, it was obvious the man had provoked arrest, for the benefit of the news cameras. Bryson, 32, is business manager for Local 563 of the Laborers International Union, a second-generation union member and a North Dakotan. Moving the Bakken field shale oil to market by pipeline is safer and more efficient than moving it by rail, he said. It has created at least 3,000 good-paying jobs in the past couple of years and will provide maintenance work well into the future. From the beginning, Bryson has gone to observe the protests in this capital city of 67,000. People have put dirt into gas tanks of heavy machinery, smashed windshields and committed other acts of vandalism, reports confirmed by local police. He himself received an anonymous email that included a photo of himself, his wife and his three small children taken from his Facebook page and his home address. He turned it over to police. He is sympathetic to concerns about burial grounds and water purity but said that he thinks the project still can be completed safely and sensitively. Bryson said about 15 of his union members working on the pipeline were Standing Rock Sioux from the reservation. He kept his eyes on protesters and police outside the federal office building. One carried a gun for firing tear-gas canisters. A heavily armored SWAT vehicle sat a half-block away. The young woman, a waitress from Florida, chose kitchen duty, so Obom sent her to a nearby tent to help prepare meals. Obom arrived here in early November, driving 25 hours in her Dodge minivan from Olympia, Wash., to join a movement she had been monitoring on social media, which was making her increasingly upset. She is among thousands of other non-indigenous people from around the country and world who have been drawn to Standing Rock. They chop firewood, build tepees, pick up trash, paint protest banners, help with recycling and composting, and attend training sessions on indigenous rights. Obom was raised in North Carolina and Washington state, and both of her parents deployed to the Middle East in Operation Desert Storm. She was deeply influenced by her mother, who was an ardent environmentalist. She soon found a gift for organizing. Now she was sleeping on the hard-packed ground in her small REI tent, pitched next to the tepee and campfire of an indigenous family that had taken her in.

Protesters in Mandan, N.D., face off with police during a rally against plans to pass the Dakota Access Pipeline on Nov. 15. That night, police used fire hoses to douse protesters in subfreezing temperatures, sending several to the hospital. A 21-year-old woman suffered severe damage to her left arm. Protesters, and her family, said that she was hit with a concussion grenade, a weapon that creates a loud sound designed to disorient people. Police said that they do not use those devices and that the woman was probably injured by a propane tank the protesters were trying to use as an improvised explosive device. Each side accuses the other of lying about the incident. Moll, who said that he was hit on the helmet by a rock that night, defended the measures as justified. Moll spent his teenage years in Philadelphia, where his father entered the Lutheran seminary, and in Yonkers, N.Y., where his father preached. He graduated from Norwich University, a military school in Vermont, thinking that he would enlist in the military. But instead he gravitated back to the Midwest and enrolled in a North Dakota police academy.

Reindeer sausage. Dried Caribou and salmon. She and 13 other Native American women had carried that homemade food in coolers and boxes on a four-flight, 10-hour odyssey from their home in Arctic Village, Alaska. Gemmill came here in early November from her tiny village, 500 miles north of Anchorage, to join the encampment. She had seen news coverage of clashes between protesters and police and felt ill over what she considered another violent indignity against native people. Her solution: bring women. Since her early 20s, Gemmill has worked against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other areas, and she sees the Dakota Access Pipeline as a dangerous over-reliance on fossil fuels that is exacerbating climate change. Gemmill was born in Arctic Village, population 150, and raised in a culture of protecting natural resources. She returned home and started programs to make sure young people were aware of their heritage, and she quickly became a rising star in tribal efforts to protect the local environment. Gemmill said that she and the other Alaska women joined a recent protest on a local highway, where they sang and drummed and prayed. Some young men in the group walked onto land owned by the pipeline developers, and, she said, they were quickly surrounded by needlessly aggressive police who sprayed them with mace. Gemmill knows the political climate in the United States is shifting sharply against her, with the election of Trump, who has vowed to lift restrictions on oil and gas producers and who is invested in an oil company that has a 25 percent stake in the pipeline.

Deer season was winding down, and he was itching to get his buck. But after five hours of tromping through the blustery prairie, he was ready for a mushroom and Swiss burger and a pile of fries. To get to the only restaurant out here, in St. Anthony, he and a buddy drove 15 miles down a gravel road, crossing over a 30-foot wide gash in the vast plains running straight as a ruler for as far as the eye could see. Brown, a burly, bearded 30-year-old in a black ball cap, said the increasing protests are costing local people money. He is a foreman for a local excavating company and said the day before, protesters tried to burn a truck on railroad tracks crossing the road to the gravel pit where he needed to pick up a load of rock. This is how these people support their families. Sitting in a restaurant with walls decorated with huge racks of antlers and other trophy heads, Brown said shipping shale oil by rail has overloaded lines and made it harder for farmers to get their wheat and other crops to market.

The Standing Rock occupation is a movement based on presence. In taking space and time away from Energy Transfer Partners, from the Army Corps of Engineers, from Morton County, from North Dakota, from the United States of America, Standing Rock has come to embody the largest show of resistance in the United States since at least the Ferguson riots of 2014. A New History The now sprawling encampment of thousands, capturing the attention of millions around the world, had a fairly modest beginning. The Sacred Stone Camp was set up on April 1 by youth of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation as a prayerful vigil to watch for the beginning of construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The tribe had already been involved in a lawsuit to prevent construction of the pipeline for close to two years. This initial camp is located on the reservation itself, close to the intersection of the Missouri and Cannonball Rivers. The Army Corps of Engineers later altered the route of the river itself in the 1940s, flooding a portion of the reservation, destroying the whirlpool and the sacred stone with them. Throughout the spring and summer, the Sacred Stone Camp served both a site of constant prayer and as launching pad for a series of symbolic actions aimed at preventing the beginning of construction. Many came to Standing Rock with their extended families directly from their annual Sundance ceremonies, so had already been camping out for up to a month before arriving. At this time, the Standing Rock tribe and the Oceti Sakowin also called on other native nations and non-native allies to join the encampment in solidarity. As supporters began flooding into Sacred Stone, the Rosebud Camp was started nearby, also on the reservation but right off of Highway 1806. It is located off reservation, officially on Army Corps of Engineers land, and thus is an illegal occupation and a direct action in itself. This encampment has become a direct challenge to the numerous treaty violations that have limited the sovereignty of the Lakota people solely to their federally managed reservations. At this point, direct actions became an almost daily occurrence, as water protectors would march the short distance from the Oceti Sakowin Camp to active construction sites and disrupt them. This summer witnessed a number of historic events. The Crows, as well as other indigenous nations who had been historic enemies of the Lakota, arrived in procession to offer peace and join together to fight the pipeline. Soon, close to 300 federally recognized tribes had sent delegations and formally declared solidarity. It was at this point that mounting tensions came to a head, thrusting Standing Rock into the national media spotlight. DAPL began hiring a private security firm to stand guard over the construction sites and prevent disruption. As the long-standing lawsuit finally neared a court decision, the Standing Rock tribe filed documentation of archeological sites, including ancestral burial grounds, that existed along the proposed pipeline route. The next day, September 3, construction workers bulldozed an ancient burial ground described in those court documents. A group of women tore down the fence surrounding the construction site, and hundreds rushed in to block the bulldozers. As the construction workers retreated, the water protectors were confronted by a private security force. In the ensuing stand-off, water protectors were pepper sprayed, punched, tackled, and bitten by attack dogs. With the images that began to circulate, so eerily reminiscent of both the 1960s Civil Rights Movement as well as the 19th Century Indian Wars, all eyes were now on Standing Rock. In the week that followed, the governor of North Dakota declared a state of emergency and called in the National Guard, who began manning a militarized checkpoint on the highway from state capital Bismarck to Standing Rock. A judge finally made a decision on the years-old lawsuit, ruling against an injunction on construction. Hours later, several branches of the Federal Government, including the Army Corps of Engineers, released a statement asking for a temporary, voluntary injunction on construction within 40 miles of the river. A smaller Front Line Camp, known as Sacred Ground Camp, was established along both sides of Highway 1806 at the site of this recent clash, monitoring the construction crews and keeping vigil over the exposed burial sites which would be disturbed by the pipeline. To maintain momentum, the camp has continually innovated their tactics. With construction now taking place much further away from the camp, they began to stage lockdown actions at these now remote locations. Due to their distance, the secrecy involved in planning, and the particular skill set required, these actions were such that only a small, specialized segment of the camp could participate in them. After one resulted in a mass arrest, they quickly lost favor, and there was a lull in action for nearly a fortnight. From late September to late October, these caravan blockades became a nearly daily occurrence. DAPL workers would leave the construction as soon as, if not before, protesters arrived. These protests revolved around ceremonies and prayers involving the planting of sacred corn or willow trees. They were tightly organized affairs, formally led by tribal elders, but with the full participation of the young and the old, men and women alike. The youth would be the first to arrive on the scene and would sometimes damage and spray paint construction equipment, before the elders arrived to command ceremony. As police began to respond in a more militarized way, and mass arrests began to happen again, the caravans began to simply drive slowly by construction sites, causing the workers to leave but without the risk of arrest. Citing the Fort Laramie treaties, the Oceti Sakowin declared eminent domain and occupied a stretch of the pipeline route. The Frontline Camp, located on what was officially DAPL property, was transformed from a small outpost to an encampment of hundreds. Barricades were put up on Highway 1806, and for nearly a week the eviction of the Frontline Camp seemed imminent. As tensions mounted, water protectors agreed to take down their barricades, but continued to maintain a check point along the highway. In a show of force, they arrived with armed vehicles, an LRAD sound cannon and riot gear. Others locked themselves to a truck. Barricades were erected and set aflame on Highways 1806 and 134. As the camp was eventually raided, new barricades were set up at the intersection of the two highways and on a bridge further south. In the midst of the chaos, construction equipment and several police vehicles were torched. In the weeks since, dramatic standoffs between water protectors and riot police deploying tear gas and rubber bullets have occurred regularly, as construction moves closer and closer to the river. With the occupation and its surrounding movement, these histories can be opened up to contemporary scrutiny and, more importantly, contestation. The struggles over the sovereignty of this land plays out in one way in the jurisdictional disputes, where you can see various departments of county and state police, the National Guard and private security companies called in to defend the so-called public and private properties being dug up to construct the DAPL. In late-September, Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II even took the issue to Geneva to address the United Nations Human Rights Council about the abuses and violations taking place on treaty lands. These efforts and counter-responses are indicative of the complex nexus of local, state, federal, private and international forces and zones that indigenous peoples have found themselves in when arguing for and defending their sovereignty. While the movement at Standing Rock draws on its own particular lineage and experience of struggle, it shares many of the signposts of recent global uprisings. Infrastructural development has often become both the object and site of struggle; the encampment and the blockade become primary among an arsenal of possible tactics and responses. The antagonists tend to be defined by being largely superfluous to the needs of capital, but who remain dependent on the market for their own reproduction. The encampment and blockade then create a rupture within the normalized experience of day-to-day life, and the experience of being within the camp becomes a laboratory to experiment with new forms of living together. They were able to present a coherent world within and against the world they opposed. This allowed for traditions of struggle to be passed down through generations, and created a certain moral obligation to participate. It also provided a coherent vision for another kind of life and a world beyond capitalism. The history of the past half-century is the story of the dismantling of the possibility of these worlds. The strength of the Standing Rock Occupation is its ability to simultaneously remember and create its own potential as a community-in-struggle. It is the continued bonds of the Oceti Sakowin and the potency of their worldview that creates the foundation for what we now know as Standing Rock to exist at all, and it this that allows for the consistency, duration and persistence that has kept the occupation going for seven months. The politics demonstrated within the occupation of Standing Rock are not based around decisions but rather commitments. In representative liberal society, decisions are made by few, affect many, and their legitimacy comes with the tacit expectation that their results will be accepted and enacted. Commitments, however, need to be made by everyone. A movement like Standing Rock, centered around duration, depends on the commitment of all those present, across days, weeks, months. This in itself guarantees its communal form: the movement exists as long as those commitments exist, which rely on the spirit of the encampments themselves to bind people together. Unlike a political mobilization, wherein people are simply called upon to act together, in Standing Rock the participants have to live together as well. And not just for some days or even weeks, but now coming on seven months. Those Gathered You can see three categories among the inhabitants of the Standing Rock occupation. At its core are those from the Oceti Sakowin, which includes those directly from what is now the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, as well as the nearby reservations which once made up the Great Sioux Nation, including Cheyenne River, Pine Ridge, Rosebud, Crow Creek, Lower Brule, etc. For them the specificity of the land itself, its hills, caves, valleys, and rivers are of primary importance, and each carry a specific historical and contemporary meaning and purpose. The Standing Rock occupation, it is said, is the first council-wide gathering of the Oceti Sakowin since the Sioux Wars more than a hundred years ago. A second category of participation and solidarity are the indigenous peoples of Turtle Island, or North America, who have sent delegations and representatives from all over the continent, in what is the largest gathering of native tribes and peoples since colonization. This display of material solidarity and commitment is a focal point of the occupation, with the main boulevard lined with hundreds of flags of tribal nations who have visited. Flags are used throughout the encampments to demarcate space, and give visual representation and tribute to those who are embodying the fabric of this new community. This could develop an ongoing consistency and momentum in its own right, beyond the occupation and this particular pipeline. A third level of participation would be all of the non-native solidarity activists who have traveled to Standing Rock to offer their support. These have typically been those inspired by an opposition to the pipeline out of a concern for the environment, and could include New Agers and hippies to independent media activists to anarchists. More broadly, people have been showing up to Standing Rock from places ranging from the Amazon, the Arctic and Palestine. It has been said that Standing Rock is the largest-ever gathering of native and non-native peoples together for a common cause, which is also one of the factors attributed to the success and longevity of the movement, prioritizing an openness to encounter and solidarity. Mapping the Site Spread out along Highway 1806 are the four separate camps that make up the occupation: Sacred Stone, Rosebud, Oceti Sakowin and Sacred Ground. Oceti Sakowin, the main camp and by far the largest, approximates a small town with a grid of dirt roads, neighborhoods and rudimentary infrastructure. The main thoroughfare leading into the camp from the highway is lined with the flags of the close to three hundred tribal nations that have arrived to show solidarity. At the heart of the camp is its sacred fire, host to a constant procession of ceremonies, dances, performances, speeches and speak-outs, and a massive communal kitchen offering daily meals. The camp now hosts an elementary school, a pirate radio station, an independent media center, a solar-powered station for charging phones and equipment, a voluntary security force organized by the American Indian Movement, a first aid station, tents offering massages, herbal medicine and herbal teas, a lacrosse field, several dozen tents distributing food, camping gear, and clothes, and dozens of portapotties, dumpsters and water tanks. There are around a dozen sweat lodges through the camp, and half a dozen horse stables. There is a horse-based messenger system, and at one point there was a race track set-up. There is a natural birth doula group at the camp that has facilitated at least one birth so far. There is also a minor fleet of motorboats and canoes. The Oceti Sakowin Camp itself is composed of dozens of constituent camps that might constitute a tribal, familial or affinity-based delegation, each built around a communal fire and kitchen. These camps-within-the-camp are autonomous and self-reproducing, and the encampments themselves have come to re-create the bare essences of human settlement. The lines are blurred between them making up a home or a village within the larger encampment: one could read the tents as individual rooms and the campfire a common area in what is essentially a unitary home; or that the tents themselves are homes, and the campfire becoming a small village square. It has its own fence surrounding it, with its own security, fire pit, supply tents, communal kitchen, daily meals, dining and meeting areas in large army tents, a library, screen-printing lab, sewing machines, and a scout-tent monitoring and mapping the construction. Adjacent to Red Warrior is a Haudenosaunee mini-camp, for Six Nations Confederacy peoples from so-called Quebec, Ontario and New York, with their own fire, meals, supplies, etc. Nearby is also a Two Spirits Camp. Such mini-camps proliferate throughout Oceti Sakowin and Standing Rock, speaking to the multiplicity within the movement. It is not at all uncommon to see, for example, a mini-camp anchored by a matriarch in her sixties, often with direct experience from the American Indian Movement of the 1970s. This generation, those born in the late 1960s and 70s, are often respected leaders within the movement, while their children, nieces and nephews in their twenties are the active warriors or volunteers on the front-lines of the protests. Then their young children or grandchildren might be seen playing and running around the camps, or now attending the school that was started for those who moved to the camps full-time with their children. This alone would be four generations, and of course within each of these camps are extended families and relations present, tiospaye in Lakota, who often refer to one another respectfully and intimately as sister, cousin, aunt or grandmother. These familial connections are rooted within a broader individual and social understanding of self within a structure of a clan, community and nation. This is to say that within the culture of the Standing Rock Occupation there are sets of relations and obligations outside of the flattening logic of citizenship, which has come to mean an empty equality of individuals lacking broader ties, responsibilities or shared histories. This could be yourself, three generations before and three generations forward. So each decision or action taken by yourself, your tiospaye, or nation should be measured as to how it would relate not just yourself or the present, as in liberal society, but for each of these generations. The Lakota have also spoken often of a prophecy of a black snake, wherein a great snake will come and bring with it incomprehensible destruction. In recent years this was interpreted as the proposed Keystone Pipeline, which was also slated to be built through Oceti Sakowin territory, before a large movement led to Obama rejecting the final phase of its construction in November 2015. Since then the prophecy has been taken to speak to any number of existing and proposed pipelines, and in August Iyuskin American Horse of Standing Rock wrote in The Guardian: Our elders have told us that if the zuzeca sape, the black snake, comes across our land, our world will end. We are protectors. We are peacefully defending our land and our ways of life. We are standing together in prayer, and fighting for what is right. We are making history here. We invite you to stand with us in defiance of the black snake. Vic Camp, an Oglala Lakota from Pine Ridge and one of the leaders of the protests, explained the difference between living in a tipi and living in a private residence. This makes Standing Rock both prefigurative of a new mode of being, as well as hearkening back to a traditional form-of-life the Lakota maintained living with and among extended families in roving, expanded settlements of tipis prior to colonization. A similar idea was articulated by American Indian Movement co-founder Clyde Bellecourt one night at the main fire of Oceti Sakowin Camp, where he said that being in the camp itself was not simply a gathering of activists and protesters, but was a mode of prayer, and prayer itself was a mode of being. One of the guides for those receiving media accreditation to take photos at Standing Rock is not to film any ceremonies taking place, but this conception of prayer itself challenges the notion that such a thing is so clearly identifiable or recognizable, as any gesture, gathering, conversation could be invoked with such purpose and intentionality as to become imperceptible. As of this writing, construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota is nearly complete, the exception being that which is slated to go under the Missouri River. The encampments and standoffs remain, as the Army Corps of Engineers and President Obama delay both intervention or approval for construction.

TransCanada, in turn, flirted back. The fights against those projects symbolized everything Trump and his cabinet appear to stand against: indigenous communities, working people, scientists, college students and more, all coming together to take on corporate interests and the governments that support them. Most unnervingly for Trump, we won. Republican leaders and the corporate interests who fund them rarely work within the kinds of issue silos that progressives tend to, segmenting concerns about the climate off from those about mass incarceration and labor rights. As resources become scarcer, more people will be criminalized and imprisoned, making way for the wealthy to keep consuming as much as they do now. And the types of Wall Street executives Trump has appointed to his cabinet could stand to make a fortune off the climate crisis, like they did after the Great Recession.

Seventeen banks, including Wells Fargo, SunTrust and Citibank, are backing the pipeline. A recent protest in Seattle, lead by native leaders and water protector allies, targeting Wells Fargo, shows the movement is gaining momentum. Martha Baskin has our report. Download Audio Members of the Standing Rock Sioux, West Coast and inland tribes, accompanied by non-Native water protectors entered a Wells Fargo bank in Seattle late last week, chanting and drumming before security officers locked the doors, preventing hundreds more from entering. As Wells Fargo security personnel watched from the sidelines and made sure no one else entered the bank, the crowd formed an oval and continued to chant. Wells Fargo Seattle referred media inquiries to corporate offices in San Francisco. The bank is one of 17 financial institutions world wide involved in financing the pipeline. In early December, the Army Corp of Engineers announced it would deny an easement which would have allowed the pipeline to go under a crossing of the river at Lake Oahe and would prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. The tribe is still awaiting publication of a notice of intent to prepare the EIS in the Federal Register. This week the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed a motion with a U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. asking the court to throw out a Dakota Access Pipeline lawsuit filed against the Army Corp of Engineers late last year. The fight to stop the pipeline will continue, she says, but the focus needs to include divesting. Matt Remle, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux who lives in Seattle, says divestment is focused on individuals as well as cities. City Council member Kshama Sawant recently introduced an ordinance that would change the process by which the contract is selected to include social justice considerations. Remle says the divestment effort has already seen success. A recent report from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis predicts more weakness in companies behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. The report concluded the pipeline is an example of overbuild in oil infrastructure in the Bakken region and as such risks becoming a stranded asset."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/259898177t?referring_akid=.436414.PunBQ6", "Timestamp": "20180919011022", "Sentences": "enter a 5-digit zip code.

She shares her experiences, and we hear from reflections from other Native people on the front lines. 2. The water protectors' direct actions are peaceful. This week's high-profile intervention was not the first time unarmed protesters have encountered police violence. Keene says part of the reason for the strong solidarity among Native tribes across the country is because the dispute over the the pipeline is part of a long-standing fight to have the sovereignty of their nations respected by the US government. These lands that the pipeline is cutting through right now are their homeland from time immemorial.. One advantage, however, is that Native people from the Plains are teaching the folks from warmer climates how to adapt, using lots of traditional methods from bonfires to longhouses. 6. Wellness teepees are helping campers deal with their mental and physical stress. This is not a Burning Man vibe. There is a protocol for how to enter these spaces, how to earn trust and eventually participate, according to Keene. Everyone has a job to do. 9.

It clearly denies first amendment rights. This year alone anti-protest legislation was introduced in over 20 states. That list includes the Absentee Shawnee, Citizen Potawatomi, Kickapoo, Sac and Fox, and Chickasaw nations. Some tribal members have pointed out that Plains All American failed to consult their tribal councils, which they note is a violation of federal law. A June 3 press release states that sacred tobacco has been planted along the trail of the proposed pipeline. This is a case of environmental racism. Beyond that, resource extraction is rape of the earth. As an indigenous woman, I feel a strong connection to the earth. The Absentee Shawnee tribe mailed a letter to all tribal members outlining how the tribe would be impacted. The underground water tables contain, as a result of the fracking, highly caustic chemicals. used in fracking. Many of the federally recognized tribes feel the pipeline is illegal due to the tribes never being properly consulted. The Nations recognize that the location of the pipeline falls within economically depressed communities that often lack financial options ito even protest the pipeline. By contrast, when police stand down, protests tend to persist, but with lower rates of arrest and a lower incidence of violence. The individual worker and local citizens should manage the means of production for their local area. It is when local workers unite then progressive and even socialist values begin to appear in our communities. Clearly the original citizens of this area, the American Indians do not want the Plains All American Pipeline in their native area. When our right wing legislators begin to take away our first amendment right to protest, something is very wrong with the fabric of democracy we hold so dear.

Police and private security forces outfitted in riot gear and armed with assault weapons have unleashed dogs, pepper spray and rubber bullets on peaceful Native Americans and their allies. Overzealous law enforcement officials in North Dakota have jailed journalists and celebrities who were exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech and the press by documenting police attacks on protesters.

The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of over 200 other tribes from across the Americas are leading the resistance to protect sovereign land and drinking water from destruction by the fossil fuel industry. However, in an attempt to quell these historic nonviolent protests, Gov.

Our society can no longer pretend that the atrocities against us have ended, and with that knowledge comes a renewed accountability. These events should also reinforce to everyone the realities of state violence, in all its forms. Native people are killed at a higher rate by police than any other group in the United States. As we have witnessed with police attacks on the movement for Black lives, structural violence is cyclical. It is a remix of old atrocities and abuses. It is the character of law enforcement, born of slave patrols and indian constables, on full display, and we must not pretend otherwise. The Army Corps and Obama have repeatedly invoked politicized language of empathy and concern. While our people have converged in peace, police from around the Midwest have also converged, to play their role in this moment of colonial and anti-colonial struggle. We are not simply protectors and warriors. We are storytellers, and we will not allow the indulgence of forgetting. Lastly, I want to reinforce that this is not over. Our people have not backed down, and I do not anticipate any such action. Elders, children and other vulnerable individuals will likely be evacuated when an eviction attempt seems imminent.

The Stop Funding DAPL event was organized to confront the financial institutions that are currently funding the Dakota Access Pipeline Project, which includes 17 different banks. The action today was directed at JPMorgan Chase bank, which has a branch at 200 Ottawa NW in downtown Grand Rapids. The action began with drumming and a song that was led by members of the Anishinaabe community. Jonathan Rinehart then spoke about the significance of December 29, which is the anniversary of the US Calvary massacre of unarmed members of the Lakota nation at Wounded Knee in 1890. Reinhart then made the connection to contemporary genocidal policies against First Nations people, like what is happening at Standing Rock. Nancy Gallardo, who has been at Standing Rock for several months and just returned this morning also spoke about what was happening there and the importance of these kinds of actions that demonstrate solidarity with the struggle in North Dakota. Another Anishinaabe woman who has also been to Standing Rock spoke and talked about the importance of water in our lives and why it is vital to fight against oil extraction no matter where it takes place. The flyer pictured above was shared during the action, encouraging people to contact the CEO of JPMorgan Chase Bank. The intent was to go into the JPMorgan Chase bank on Ottawa, but when we began the action there were already cops there and a private security guard from the bank standing outside the doors. By this time there were 8 GRPD cars on the scene and one bicycle cop to protect the bank.

Sullivan, a 35-year-old navy veteran from San Diego, who returned home from Standing Rock on Monday, had not heard he was a suspect until a Guardian reporter called him on Thursday afternoon. The arson accusation, which police said could lead to prosecution, is the latest in a series of arrests and charges filed against veterans aiding indigenous groups fighting the pipeline, which could soon be in operation. Last month, police filed charges against two veterans supporting Standing Rock, holding one in jail for several days. The prosecutions raised concerns that police were trying to prevent them from going to the camps. The Guardian interviewed Sullivan last week on the day a highly militarized police operation began raiding the camps and making arrests. Throughout the day, some activists were setting fire to remaining structures at Oceti Sakowin, the main Standing Rock camp that is now completely evacuated. Sullivan told the Guardian at the time that he witnessed an explosion in a tipi and helped two people to safety. On Thursday, he said the photo that police took from his Facebook shows him near a different burning structure. He said he was on the other end of camp when people first lit it on fire and that he briefly came over later and took a photo of it. Sean Sullivan says the photo on his Facebook page was taken near a burning structure, but he had nothing to do with the fire. Photograph: Facebook Sullivan said many journalists saw him take a photo and that the image he put on Facebook is from Vice News. The veterans charged last month were accused of drug offenses after they were searched and found to have small amounts of cannabis, which they said they were prescribed to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Some Native American activists are already facing serious arson charges and potentially hefty prison sentences. Many similar charges, however, were also dropped or rejected by a judge last year due to lack of evidence. Keller said he suspects Sullivan could face charges, but did not provide further details.

Pipeline protests are expanding across the country. ARI SHAPIRO, HOST: Months of protests over the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota have come to an end. Construction on the pipeline is going forward after President Trump intervened in January. Now, it's almost finished. Oil could start flowing in the coming weeks. But the Dakota Access pipeline battle at the Standing Rock Reservation has energized others. NPR's Jeff Brady is here to tell us more about pipeline protests around the country. Hi, Jeff. JEFF BRADY, BYLINE: Hi, Ari. BRADY: They have. And it's because of a strategy that's really led by environmental groups. And their goal is to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Now, in the past, those groups, they encourage people to use less oil, drive smaller cars, walk more, that sort of thing. But that didn't work out very well. So they came up with this new strategy. And I think the Keystone XL pipeline - you probably remember that from a couple of years ago - it's a really good example of it. This is a pipeline that would have transported crude oil from Canada's oil sands down to the Gulf Coast. Opponents succeeded in delaying construction of the Keystone XL. And ultimately, President Obama blocked the project. President Trump says he wants the pipeline now. But the economics have completely changed. Oil prices are half of what they were just a few years ago. So recently, we see ExxonMobil and Shell decide that it's not profitable to open up new oil sands projects in Canada. Those fossil fuels, they're going to stay on the ground. And score one for those environmental groups. SHAPIRO: So these environmentalists have adopted a new strategy of protesting pipelines. BRADY: At first, they just looked at the ones where they were most likely to succeed, like the Keystone XL. But now, we're seeing campaigns pop up all over the place, even in Texas and Louisiana. And those are two big oil producing states. We thought we'd take a look at a couple of these places. First, we have a report from our colleague Marie Cusick from WITF in Harrisburg and StateImpact Pennsylvania. She recently visited a protest site in the central part of the state. MARIE CUSICK, BYLINE: Amidst the rolling farm fields of Pennsylvania Amish country, protesters are settling in for the long haul. They've built two tall wooden structures that looked sort of like tree houses without the tree. Once built, it will move natural gas southward through Pennsylvania. MARK CLATTERBUCK: So right behind us is this old historic tobacco barn that we're using as kind of the base of operations. We're - that's where we're storing food donations, as well as supplies, camping supplies, tarps. CUSICK: The landowners here refused to make a deal with the pipeline company. Now, part of their farm may be taken through eminent domain. That's why they've welcomed in dozens of protesters who've set up camp in a cornfield. The site has a food truck, a large military tent and portable toilets. CLATTERBUCK: We're running electric. And we'll run cable here so we have the internet as well. CUSICK: He and others here took part in the Standing Rock protests in North Dakota. They've taken lessons from that experience and are rehearsing nonviolent direct action scenarios. Molly Wallace says she's probably too much of a wuss to stay out in a tent overnight. But she wants to make her voice heard. MOLLY WALLACE: Yeah. I'm willing to get arrested. It's a cause worth getting arrested for. CUSICK: The cause encompasses a long list of concerns about the pipeline, including its implications for climate change, the seizure of private property and questions over whether there's really a public need for all of this gas, since some of it will be exported. Chris Stockton is a spokesman for Williams, the company behind the Atlantic Sunrise project. CHRIS STOCKTON: We've actually made modifications to more than half of the route trying to accommodate folks the best we can. But certainly, there's always going to be opposition. CUSICK: President Donald Trump is viewed as friendly to the oil and gas industry. But Williams CEO Alan Armstrong warned his colleagues at a conference this year that they shouldn't get too complacent because of the new administration. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ALAN ARMSTRONG: That is not changing the opposition that we have at a local level. And we're going to continue to see that. And I would tell you, it may even enhance. CUSICK: And it's true, activists are taking inspiration from each other in coordinating. Stephanie Graybill is at the Lancaster camp with her two daughters. She runs the kitchen. She also protested at Standing Rock and knows six people who are making their way out to Pennsylvania. STEPHANIE GRAYBILL: I think Standing Rock's the playbook for camps like ours because we're tired of government pushing us around. They're supposed to be working for us, not working against us. CUSICK: As the camp continues to grow, the pipeline company has failed to get permission from dozens of property owners. It's now taking them to court. MOLLY SAMUEL, BYLINE: In Georgia, there's a lot of political pushback against taking private land for these projects. I'm Molly Samuel from WABE in Atlanta. Right now, there's a moratorium on new petroleum pipelines while the state legislature debates the laws around pipelines and eminent domain. ANDRES VILLEGAS: That threat of losing land with no recourse is something that can keep a land owner awake at night. SAMUEL: Andres Villegas is the president of the Georgia Forestry Association. Tree farming is a big business here. It's even older than the state. VILLEGAS: Forestry and landownership that comes with it has been woven into the fabric of Georgia since the time of the colonization of the state. It's been a central part of the economy. It's been a central part of the culture. SAMUEL: There are people here whose families have been on the same land since the 1700s. So it wasn't just environmental activists who got up in arms when a company proposed building a pipeline along the coast in 2015. Opponents had powerful allies from the business world and in politics, from both sides of the aisle. BILL HITCHENS: You know, I'm a Republican from a Republican area. SAMUEL: State Representative Bill Hitchens proposed that moratorium on new petroleum pipelines. HITCHENS: I may very well have had more Democratic votes because it affects everybody. SAMUEL: The pipeline was shelved. South Carolina has a moratorium in place too over the same pipeline. Hitchens says he's pro-business. And he understands if you have to lose private property for something that serves the public like a road. HITCHENS: But I think people look at it a little differently when you lose it so somebody else can make some money off of it. SAMUEL: There's another pipeline though that Georgia lawmakers couldn't block. The federal government granted the Sabal Trail pipeline permission to use eminent domain along its route through Alabama, Georgia and Florida. It's being built now, though people are setting up Standing Rock-like camps in protest. SHAPIRO: That's Molly Samuel in Georgia. And NPR's Jeff Brady is still on the line with us. Jeff, President Trump has signed several executive actions designed to speed up the approval process for new pipelines. BRADY: I think we should expect more confrontations around the country because on one side, you have an industry that now has an ally in the White House. They're very optimistic. And on the other side, you have pipeline opponents who've experienced some success. And they're not ready to give up just because there's a new administration in the White House. SHAPIRO: That's NPR's Jeff Brady. Thanks a lot. BRADY: You're welcome, Ari. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www.npr.org for further information.

Carson made the comments as Guardian Films publishes a film examining community relations in Dearborn, Michigan, which is home to the biggest mosque in North America. The film features five citizens from different backgrounds, from Muslims to Christians, citizen militias and young university graduates, and explores how they see American identity, and grapple with questions of religion, race and class. While there is not comprehensive data to provide a number of Muslims who currently hold elected office in local and state bodies around the US, religious discrimination and an increase in hate crimes has spurred more Muslims to explore politics, according to some groups that focus on representing Muslims in the government. Informal surveys indicate New Jersey leading the way, with at least 14 Muslim Americans currently in public office. After Trump signed an executive order seeking to ban immigrants from certain Muslim-majority countries, one advocacy group, Jetpac, launched a formal campaign designed to encourage more Muslims to run for local office and adopt a more active role in community organizing. American Muslims in Michigan have gained significant success in running for elected office, and Abdul El-Sayed, the former Detroit health commissioner, recently announced a run for governor in 2018. It was a vote of fear and cynicism. Clearly, it is more important than ever that we confront the insidiousness that is Islamophobia. While Muslims pride themselves on being up to date on national politics, as well as being well versed in world events, when it comes to local politics Muslims are mostly absent. Many Muslims only vote in the presidential elections, if they vote at all. We all have families and responsibilities that need our attention. But the time for sitting back and letting others take the lead and do the heavy lifting is over. We have to stop looking around for the perfect leader, and start standing up and being leaders. We must engage. We must reach out and help others who are struggling, even when we are struggling too. We must form real relationships where we each know we can depend on each other in times of need. Supporting local causes outside of our Muslim communities. United, we rise above the hate. It may seem like Islamophobia is everywhere, but the solution is local. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Abdul El-Sayed. My father and mother immigrated to Michigan from Egypt. I was raised by my father and my stepmother, Jackie, a native of Gratiot County, Michigan. This is where I was born and where I was raised. I love Michigan. Our politicians seem to have forgotten that government should be for people, by people. Part of that is because corporate politicians like our current president are too busy dividing us rather than uniting us around our common goals. We can unlock our economy, fix our failing public schools, break our dependence on oil, save our Great Lakes and provide everyone with quality healthcare. The vote for the current president was not a vote of inspiration. It was a vote of fear and cynicism. I was rebuilding a health department in Detroit after the city shuttered its 185-year old health department when it was facing state takeover. I realized that, in that moment, our state needed real leadership. But I still think it comes with responsibility to motivate and encourage other Muslims to participate in the political process. And even though the Muslim community is not a monolith, there is a mutual interest, even though there are different schools of thought. We have just as much a right to it as any other citizen in the United States."}, {"URL": "http://www.windspeaker.com/news/windspeaker-news/prophecies-of-old-coming-to-fruition-in-fight-for-mother-earth/", "Timestamp": "20180918222716", "Sentences": "Search Search Listen Live On Air Now Toggle On Air and Now Playing Visibility Song information is currently unavailable. The unprecedentedly huge rally drew Indigenous people from diverse nations across Western Canada who spoke, sang and drummed alongside politicians on all levels who oppose the pipeline.

By Monday afternoon, nearly 3,000 people had signed on. At the rally, several prominent politicians vowed to risk arrest if construction on the Kinder Morgan expansion begins, including Burnaby Mayor Derek Corrigan and Green Party Leader Elizabeth May. Corrigan has been a prominent opponent of the project in the courts and at National Energy Board hearings, and he said he will continue to fight in any way he can. UBCIC president, Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, told the crowd that he believes that mass displays of opposition of big oil being seen now, from B.C. to Standing Rock, were prophesized centuries ago by Indigenous leaders.

Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of CREDO activists who stood with our indigenous and climate movement allies in North Dakota, we temporarily blocked construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, but our fight to stop the pipeline once and for all is not yet over. But we have the collective financial power as consumers and account holders to stop the pipeline. We must call on these banks to divest from this massive project immediately before Trump can approve the construction of the pipeline. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline. As of Jan. 1, ETP has effectively failed to meet its contractual obligations to deliver oil through the Dakota Access pipeline. Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline. By staying invested in these projects, these 17 banks are tacitly waging a coordinated campaign to destroy sacred Native lands and silence peaceful protest. This could be our last shot at stopping the Dakota Access pipeline before Donald Trump takes office on January 20. We stood with the water protectors and our allies in the climate justice movement to put a halt to the pipeline once before, and we must stand with them again to shut this project down for good.

To some non-indigenous people looking into this moment from the outside, this may seem an abstract exaggeration. No one has died, they might say. There are legal dimensions to the issue. But this is no exaggeration. Today, on February 22, 2017, the United States is repeating history, and unless we get ourselves, our cities, our states, our pension funds, and our universities to divest from banks financing the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) and Keystone XL Pipeline (KXL), we all have oil on our hands. In 1851, the U.S. government subjected Lakota and Dakota bands to the Fort Laramie Treaty. When settlers discovered gold within the bounds of the Great Sioux Nation, the United States government used its military might to break its own treaty. Over time, the U.S. Army forced people out of that treaty land and onto increasingly smaller reservations. Today, on February 22, 2017, North Dakota Law Enforcement, the National Guard, DAPL mercenaries, and even our own relatives in the BIA Indian Police are evicting from this same land, indigenous people who dare to stand up to corporate interests for the next Seven Generations and Mother Earth. They have asserted this whole time that they are home by reminding everyone that the camps are completely within the boundaries of the Great Sioux Nation. Water Protectors did not endure German Shepherds, violations of their dignity, tear gas, rubber bullet wounds, and water cannons in freezing temperatures for the past seven months, just for the rest of us to shrug our shoulders and wait for the courts to bring justice. It would be foolish to put all of our eggs into the courts. This is larger than Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, than Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, than any of the Water Protectors being evicted on the ground. Law enforcement may be evicting the Oceti Oyate and Oceti Sakowin camps today, but they cannot evict the Spirit of Standing Source: Indian Country Today Rock. Decades of colonialist policies have estranged us from our land, from our people, and from our ways of living. But because of those policies of displacement, we are everywhere, and we can use that to our advantage in this moment. Millions of us entrust our money, investments, pensions, and taxpayer money to banks financing DAPL. Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and more, all have complete control of our money. It may be inconvenient and arduous for individuals and administrators to make the switch, but drinking oil is also inconvenient. If you have access to the internet, a phone, and some time, you can carry the movement from Standing Rock. Take San Francisco as an example. A group of individuals from various Native Nations, labor organizations, and climate justice organizations have been inspired to see indigenous activists pressure Seattle, Davis, and other cities and institutions to divest from banks financing DAPL. So, they came together to create the indigenous-led San Francisco Defund DAPL Coalition. The Coalition has conducted hours upon hours of research to learn lessons from the indigenous leaders of the Seattle Defund DAPL Coalition, gather data from Food & Water Watch, find alternative commercial banks, and even draft an ordinance for divesting City funds. However, the Coalition has faced one significant challenge: a lack of empathy and urgency from people in power. It is likely that other divestment campaigns will meet the same challenge. When people in power do not make time in their busy schedules to work with indigenous activists, they are signaling to the President and the world that Indians are, indeed, unworthy of our political energies. But the apathy and lack of urgency is not exclusive to non-indigenous elected officials. When we, as administrators or as individuals, postpone switching our banks because it is inconvenient, or because we are too busy, we are signaling to the Powers that Be, that we are okay with them using our hard earned money to build a pipeline through the second largest source of drinking water in this country. To put it simply, we need to divest from banks financing the Dakota Access Pipeline because the value of our money, endowments, pensions, and investments should not rise with increasing repression of indigenous and human rights. We owe it to all of them to carry on the torch of this movement to cities across the country. Find a credit union near you at culookup.com.

The different treatment of the two groups could not have been more stark. The fact that the Water Protectors were fighting a battle that effects millions of those who depend upon the Missouri River; that they were camping out in the depth of a South Dakota winter, and that they were met by violence as if they were terrorists of the first order. Then we have a heavily armed militia that takes over (and shuts down) a national refuge and who are staying inside with all of the conveniences. They essentially hold an entire city hostage, and yet except for one member who seemed bent on martyrdom, the barely got a slap on the wrist. Clearly race was at play, but there was a much deeper narrative. On the one hand you have primarily indigenous people standing up peacefully to protect something(s) that are sacred from corporate investors who are up to their necks in environmental destruction. There are few extraction and processing activities more environmentally devastating than tar sands. The further dispute the standing of any law that supersedes their own. Today the tribes fight on for all of us, and for their own survival. After shooting like a nova onto the global scene, the cone of silence has once again descended. Remember Standing Rock. Be informed. Spread the word. Do not let them stand alone under an enforced invisibility. Jennni Monet At the height of the movement at Standing Rock, Indigenous teens half a world away in Norway were tattooing their young bodies with an image of a black snake. Derived from Lakota prophecy, the creature had come to represent the controversial Dakota Access pipeline for the thousands of water protectors determined to try to stop it. It was a show of international solidarity between the Indigenous Sami and the Lakota. The backstory can be told simply. Temporary communities of thousands were created on the reservation borderlands in nonviolent resistance against the crude oil project. Police arrested more than 800 people, and many water protectors faced attack dogs, concussion grenades, rubber bullets, and, once, a water cannon on a freezing night in November. Last February, armored vehicles and police in riot gear cleared the last of the encampments. Oil now flows through the pipeline under the Missouri. But this Indigenous-led disruption, the awakening resolve that was cultivated at Standing Rock, did not dissolve after February. Rather, it spread in so many different directions that we may never fully realize its reach. The spirit of resistance can easily be found in the half-dozen or so other pipeline battles across the United States. To be sure, post-colonization has always demanded acknowledgment of Indigenous autonomy. He wanted to remind the world that European colonizers had honored Iroquois Confederacy nationhood upon entering treaty agreements under the two row wampum. The story of White Clay, Nebraska, is indicative. There, another fight for justice was mounting, for families living on the neighboring Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. This one focused on a decades-long dispute over beer sales targeted at Native American customers mostly prone to alcohol addiction. Demands turned to broader issues: investigation of dozens of unsolved crimes in White Clay against Native Americans. Matthew had been caretaker of one of the main communities at Standing Rock, and he settled right in at Camp Justice at the edge of Pine Ridge. For all the momentum that the resistance at Standing Rock brought, the Indigenous rights movement in the 21st century faces increasing challenges. Tribal nations tread cautiously under the administration of Donald Trump. Internationally, the militarized protection of extractive energy projects and theft of land persist, despite glaring media attention paid to the rising number of Indigenous peoples killed or jailed for their activism in the face of it. The difference of opinion between the two leaders is a conflict that often lies at the heart of tribal community: protecting the Earth or protecting the Indigenous peoples. Clean up efforts at site of Keystone Pipeline spill in South Dakota ( Greenpeace) On the eve of Thanksgiving 2017, when the Keystone pipeline ruptured and spilled 210,000 gallons of oil in neighboring South Dakota, the newly elected Faith remained notably silent while water protectors responded with outrage, most loudly, closest to home. Like Archambault and other tribal leaders, Frazier was arrested for participating in the Standing Rock occupation. Leadership in the Indigenous world is not only a difficult balance, but also dangerous. In July, she survived an attack by a group of assailants wielding machetes. Just weeks earlier she had been named the new leader of the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras, the nonprofit organization formerly led by her mother. Meantime, the organization Global Witness reports that it has never been deadlier to take a stand against companies that steal land and destroy the Earth. In 2016, the watchdog group found that nearly four activists a week are murdered fighting against mining, logging, and other extractive resource development. As disturbing as this reality is, it is unsurprising then to recall the military-style violence at Standing Rock: the rows of riot police pointing their guns at unarmed activists standing in the river; tanks shooting water in freezing temperatures at a crowd of people gathered on a bridge. In this one regard, Standing Rock was not unique in the world. It had become crucially important. Sustaining this awakening is the next great task. Climate change poses one of the most serious reminders of why the sacred fires ignited at Standing Rock must continue to burn: Indigenous peoples and their knowledge and value systems matter. The girl who once tended cattle in the region of Chad bordering northeastern Nigeria has now become a bridge for her people and government officials making decisions impacting the fragile ecosystem of Lake Chad, the lifeline for the Mbororo. Jannie Staffansson, a representative of the Saami Council, wants what Chief Deskaheh had petitioned to the League of Nations nearly a century earlier: sovereign recognition for Indigenous Peoples on an international scale. She paused to check the Snapchat account she had been using to engage with a young Sami audience while at COP, a demographic similar to the teens who got tattoos of the black snake.

This week's high-profile intervention was not the first time unarmed protesters have encountered police violence. Keene says part of the reason for the strong solidarity among Native tribes across the country is because the dispute over the the pipeline is part of a long-standing fight to have the sovereignty of their nations respected by the US government. These lands that the pipeline is cutting through right now are their homeland from time immemorial.. One advantage, however, is that Native people from the Plains are teaching the folks from warmer climates how to adapt, using lots of traditional methods from bonfires to longhouses. 6.

The announcement was a deep blow to the Standing Rock Sioux. The tribe has been protesting the pipeline for months, along with environmentalists and social justice activists from around the world. But hours later, across the country, something different happened in Washington state. And looking beyond Seattle, they hope to serve as a model for other communities looking for new ways to resist fossil fuel infrastructure. Army Corps of Engineers to grant final easement for Dakota Access Pipeline The Trump administration told a federal court it plans to approve the final permit for the pipeline. Advertisement As the Trump administration prepares to set in motion the pro-fossil fuel energy agenda that Trump promised during the campaign, much attention has turned to cities, which generally skew more progressive than the country at large. Creating a movement Seattle is no stranger to progressive citywide politics. It also has a relatively large indigenous population, with more 29 federally-recognized Native American tribes located in Washington state. The Dakota Access Pipeline captivated national attention for months as thousands of protesters clashed with local and federal officials in North Dakota; that fight offered Seattle activists a concrete issue around which to coalesce a resistance movement. Starting in August, Native groups in Seattle began discussing what was happening in North Dakota, and how they could help draw attention to, and support, the protest movement beginning to grow there. The rally drew modest media attention, and garnered support from a handful of city politicians. Afterwards, Remle and other Native organizers decided to keep the momentum going by organizing rallies and demonstrations against the pipeline on a regular basis. And they saw the divestment push as a chance to radically alter the way the city of Seattle does business with banks, drafting language that mandates a set of socially responsible practices that must be given considerable weight when deciding which banks to do business with in the future. But as much as the paradoxical timing was a stark reminder of how incremental victories can be easily wiped out by a president who, despite presenting himself as a populist, shows little regard for the will of the people, it was also a testament to the awesome power of tenacious grassroots organizing. There is some hope that the success of the Seattle initiative will bolster the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, which is likely to face intense opposition both in the courts and in the streets. Protests, rallies, and marches voicing opposition to Trump and his policies have ballooned in the weeks since his inauguration, but there can be a disconnect between voicing opposition to a policy and enacting policies to counteract it. For protesters looking for a tangible way to throw sand in the gears of the Trump administration, Seattle offers a blueprint for social action turned into successful city policy. The majority of working people in America are in no mood to negotiate with Trump. The movement is already growing. Seattle organizers are also working with tribes to encourage tribal divestment. The Muckleshoot Indian tribe has already divested from Wells Fargo, and Remle expects other tribes to adopt a similar strategy. In the conflict over treaty rights and indigenous land, they see a struggle similar to one that they have been engaged in for years in the Pacific Northwest. For more than half a decade, oil, coal, and natural gas companies have been eyeing the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California as potential gateways to overseas markets, proposing a rash of export terminals and refineries meant to receive fossil fuel from the center of the country and send it out to the rest of the world. But as the Dakota Access reversal shows, those victories are tenuous, especially under the Trump administration. Remle, who heard about the decision to grant the easement while waiting to testify in support of the Seattle ordinance on Tuesday, described the moment as bittersweet."}, {"URL": "http://bsnorrell.blogspot.com/2016/11/standing-rock-water-protectors-under.html", "Timestamp": "20180919003111", "Sentences": "Standing Rock Water Protectors under Police Night Attack Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016 Water cannons blast water protectors tonight in freezing temperatures.

The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of over 200 other tribes from across the Americas are leading the resistance to protect sovereign land and drinking water from destruction by the fossil fuel industry. However, in an attempt to quell these historic nonviolent protests, Gov.

Several pieces of litigation over Dakota Access remain stalled in federal courts, but will not have teeth should ETP resume construction the moment USACE gives the official green light. We are a sovereign nation and we will fight to protect our water and sacred places from the brazen private interests trying to push this pipeline through to benefit a few wealthy Americans with financial ties to the Trump administration.

On Friday afternoon, as snow rapidly melted during an unusually warm day in Cannon Ball, Jake Pogue helped organize a vets camp area at Sacred Stone, the first camp that emerged last spring in opposition to the pipeline. Since last fall, police have made roughly 700 arrests, at times deploying water cannons, Mace, rubber bullets, teargas, pepper spray and other less-than-lethal weapons. Private guards for the pipeline have also been accused of violent tactics. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, founder of the Sacred Stone camp and a Standing Rock tribe member, said she welcomed the return of the vets. At Standing Rock, indigenous activists say the mass arrests and police violence have led many of them to develop PTSD, suffering symptoms that many veterans understand well.

Today, Bank DNB announced it is going to sell its assets in the Dakota Access Pipeline project. Original petition text: Over 100 water protectors were brutally arrested by Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) security forces -- some locked in dog kennels and shot at with rubber bullets and pepper spray -- just for standing up for their ancestral lands and our most precious resource, water. Thousands have peacefully gathered in person and in solidarity to stop this 570,000 barrel-per-day pipeline that would endanger the water and ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. And while this inspiring work is going on, the banks that we use every day are backing the project with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and investment each. Demand your bank to stop financially supporting from the Dakota Access Pipeline and associated projects such as Energy Transfer now. North Dakota recorded nearly 300 oil pipeline spills in less than two years -- and none were disclosed to the public. The DAPL was originally going to be routed near the city of Bismarck -- but was rejected because it would have run so close to municipal water sources. Bank DNB, BBVA, TD, Wells Fargo, Mizuho Bank, BayernLB, Citibank, ING, Deutsche Bank, RBC, Credit Suisse, UBS, Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole, Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, and ABN Amro Capital all support the project financially. These banks are vulnerable to public pressure. We are their customers and shareholders -- and they need our business. Stop the money, stop a pipeline. Tell your bank to stop funding the project now. What we are bearing witness to at Standing Rock is a moment of history. We can't all be in North Dakota, but we can all stand in solidarity with those who are. Which is why after you sign the petition, we will list other ways you can support to help the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe stop the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Just minutes earlier, she and the rest of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe learned that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers won't grant an easement that would have allowed construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) to cross under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River. Her joy is tangible, her infectious laugh punctuating every sentence. Klein asks her how she feels about the news. Then, she breaks down in tears. It's a short video, just over a minute long. Now, young Native American activists are looking ahead, focused on the very future Iron Eyes mentioned. While Sunday's victory is historic and certainly cause for celebration, Indigenous people have quickly called for continued vigilance, especially from young activists on social media. She says there's been an atmosphere of celebration as well as apprehension over the past few days, especially because they don't know what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Sunday's decision was made by the Obama administration, which will transition power to an administration that supports the completion of the pipeline project. But we must remain cautious, Trump is right next in line. And many activists and water protectors say the good news won't erase the reported human rights abuses that have taken place. While Reuters reported that Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, asked those who are not Sioux to leave the area for the winter on Tuesday, water protectors aren't planning to leave anytime soon. In March, when they heard about plans to reroute the Dakota Access Pipeline away from Bismarck and through sacred land, they took action. As part of the Standing Rock Youth, a group of about 30 young people from the Standing Rock Sioux community, they decided to go online, and make their issue known. By now, it has more than 460,000 signatures, including endorsements from celebrities and influencers like Leonardo DiCaprio, Shailene Woodley, Bill McKibben and Ndaba Mandela. And those are the very people they wanted to galvanize. Native American Kids Standing Up Against Big Oil Company. READ, SIGN & SHARE our petition. On July 15, the group also organized a 2,000-mile relay race to Washington, D.C. to deliver their petition. That same day, the camp received notice that construction on the pipeline would begin. Like the young people before her, Ladonna Brave Bull Allard grabbed her iPhone, made a video and posted it to Facebook. While Native-led news outlets, such as The Last Real Indians and Indian Country Today, have covered the pipeline and its threat of sacred land since the beginning, most mainstream news outlets didn't give the story attention until August. That's when thousands of water protectors and allies assembled to physically block construction, and when the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia heard the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's lawsuit. Since then, the movement's grown exponentially. When the situation at Standing Rock became especially tense in September, as North Dakota law enforcement unleashed dogs and pepper spray on water protectors, those at Standing Rock uploaded videos to Facebook and Twitter to show the rest of the world what was happening. In October, Native American activists and allies started using Facebook Live and other videos on the social network to further broadcast standoffs with police. She witnessed, in real-time, a police officer macing her little sister in the Youth Council with a large canister for an extended period of time. And they seemed pretty shaken by that. The tool, Wise says, has allowed large numbers of people to understand what's actually happening on the ground. Later that month, thousands of allies started checking in to the Standing Rock Reservation on Facebook, in an attempt to confuse police after rumors that they were monitoring the social network to keep track of water protectors. However, local law enforcement denied this, which meant the effort, while well-intentioned, didn't achieve what allies hoped. Dallas Goldtooth (Mdewakanton Dakota and Dine), an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, told Mashable in October that he felt the Facebook check-ins actually helped generate support. Beyond media attention, the impact of these social media campaigns is felt within Indigenous communities, too. Wise says the movement has very much been about the youth reclaiming their own power, especially since many elders may not live to see the true impact of their decisions. But it's also about showing the incredible solidarity across various Indigenous communities that have converged on Standing Rock, and the powerful moments they share. The wide sentiment among activists is that it's a temporary victory, especially as a Trump administration looms. That includes further honing their social media skills. Wise says one thing Indigenous youth and other water protectors have learned is to make hard copies of everything they post online. They've encountered instances in which Facebook has removed posts, or technical issues randomly shorten or delete posts. They're also learning how best to navigate Facebook's algorithm, working to make sure people can see what's happening in real-time and remain educated. The fight is NOT OVER.

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Descendants of West African slaves in South Carolina are fighting to prevent their land from being confiscated and auctioned. The first Lillian Milton knew about it was when she arrived at the local council offices to settle her tax bill. She was shocked - at that point she had not even been connected to the sewer system. I had to get cash money - 880 some dollars that I had to pay them to get my place back. Many of her friends and neighbours in Jackson Village, one of three black communities in Plantersville, South Carolina, face losing their homes in a similar way if they don't pay the tax for a sewer they say they didn't want and don't need. Last week 20 homes were put up for auction. Most residents are the direct descendants of West African slaves, who bought land on the former rice plantation, or were deeded it by the government, after emancipation in 1865. Property ownership had special meaning for these former slaves, known as Gullah Geechee, and the land has been proudly passed down through the generations, as a safe haven to raise families and farm. But America's seemingly insatiable appetite for coastal living and the money that can be made from buying up cheap former plantation land is a potential threat. Because they come to take your land. With its neat brick-built bungalows, set back from the road in their own plots of land, and protected from the roar of Highway 701 by a dense forest, Jackson Village feels secure and cushioned against change. But few residents here have deeds to their homes. The freed slaves who originally bought the land were mistrustful of the legal system, or excluded from it, and did not leave written wills. The land is held in common. Ben Grate estimates that more than a million people, spread out across America, have a share of land in Plantersville, whether they know it or not. So although they are living on prime real estate, much sought after for holiday homes, golf courses or country clubs, they cannot simply sell up for a fat profit. The residents can also have their home seized and sold off if they don't pay their taxes. Residents who have their homes taken in this way have a year to redeem them, as Milton did. But like others I spoke to she does not think it is fair that they have to pay for a sewer system they were forced to connect to even if their septic tanks were working well. There is also indignation that the tax was not part of the deal when the system was first proposed 10 years ago. But some of the Gullah Geechee suspected an ulterior motive. Historically, the installation of a public sewer has often been the first step towards opening up an area for suburban development. Some of the white landowners in Plantersville, who live in the old plantation owners' homes, the entrances of which can be seen as you drive through the forest to Jackson Village, also opposed the scheme, as they suspected it was being pushed by land speculators. In 2008, Tee Miller, the then director of rural development in South Carolina for the US Department of Agriculture, came down on their side. In a letter to the head of the Georgetown County and Sewer District, he expressed concern that the black residents did not realise that they would now have to pay a monthly tax to cover the loan repayments. The Rev Ben Grate says the Gullah residents are the victims of racial discrimination, because Plantersville's white residents did not have to hook up to the system. He doesn't accept that the black residents' septic tanks were in worse condition, as the authorities argue, and after seeing his home and 19 others put up for auction last week, he sees this as a fight for the future of his people. We would be back into slavery. We feel that the same thing happened to the slaves when they were coming over. It also had the backing of church leaders and county councillors, as well as the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which said residents badly needed access to good sanitation. In July, a number of Plantersville residents took part in a protest march on the state capitol building in Columbia. Earlier, about 200 had signed a petition against the sewer. But some of those who had initially held out against the tax have now scraped together the cash to pay it. Ben Grate, however, is in no mood to cave in and is now attempting to draw the Gullah Geechee's plight to the attention of state governor Nikki Hayley. The Milton family is standing with him.

The demonstration arrived at Wells Fargo on Capitol Hill, as the protest had grown slightly, adding families and late-comers to the march. Matt Remle, a Lakota Native and environmental activist, led the protest with the American Indian Movement song. The predatory lending practices that Remle were referring to were identified as the cause of many individuals in communities of color and low-income communities losing their homes through foreclosures and loss of equity during and after the Great Financial Crisis of 2008.

This is the second shutdown in just as many months. The column of fire burning from the punctured pipeline reportedly reached 150 feet. Eyewitnesses described the disaster to ABC News. EYEWITNESS 2: It looked like there was like a plane crash. NERMEEN SHAIKH: This comes after the same pipeline leaked nearly 340,000 gallons of gasoline in Central Alabama in September, forcing the line to shut down for 12 days and leading six governors to declare states of emergency as gas prices rose throughout the region. AMY GOODMAN: Now Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee are seeking an investigation of the Georgia-based company. He has traveled to the site of the Colonial Pipeline Company disaster, is monitoring its environmental impacts. We only have a few minutes. DAVID BUTLER: Yeah, absolutely. First, you know, we want to express our condolences to the worker that passed away and also the workers that are injured. And what happened was, they were doing some routine work on the pipeline in preparation for the repair that they need to do on the previous leak site, and there was a contact with the pipe, and caused an explosion. NERMEEN SHAIKH: But tell us a little bit about the ecosystem of this river. There are reportedly more species of fish in the Cahaba River than there are in the whole state of California. DAVID BUTLER: Absolutely. And the area that the pipeline is in is tremendously sensitive. DAVID BUTLER: Yeah. That does it for our show. or your station runs us. Tune in there.

Author: Kelly Hayes Publish date: Mar 13, 2018 Fort Yates, North Dakota, September 2017. (Illustration: Elias Stein) About two weeks before what would end up being my last trip to Standing Rock, I was a guest speaker for Indigenous Peoples Day at a Chicago school, where I explained to a group of about 80 fourth through eighth graders how Native youth had created an encampment to resist the Dakota Access Pipeline, and how that pipeline threatened to contaminate the drinking water of the Standing Rock Sioux. The students were excited to learn that there were children in the Standing Rock camps, and that the movement had been created by young people. At the end of our discussion, the children made blue, river-shaped banners bearing messages of hope and love for those on the front lines. I had planned to mail them to my friends in Standing Rock, but as fate would have it, I wound up hanging them myself, in one of the kitchen tents in Oceti Sakowin. Visit Website My health was lousy at the time, and I had promised my husband that my second trip to Standing Rock, just one month prior, would be my last for the year. But then, just before Halloween, police launched an assault, raiding one of the movement's encampments and threatening others. Visit Website I knew I had to go back. Sacred Stone Village (in the background) was founded by LaDonna Bravebull Allard to carry the vision and energy of the Standing Rock camps forward through teaching young people about Native American history, culture, language, and ways of life. Larry Towell took the photograph of Oceti camp (in the foreground) in September of 2016 during the height of the controversy over the Dakota Access Pipeline. He returned one year later to witness a healing gathering at Sacred Stone Village and to document where the movement is headed. In the spring and summer of 2016, a magnetic energy was born in Standing Rock. I had been there in the early days, when no more than a dozen tents dotted the shoreline encampment at Sacred Stone. One of the Native youth who launched the encampment had asked me to come lead some skill-shares on direct action and protest tactics. Native mothers, fathers, and young children crowded around me on that first visit as I explained the mechanics of a basic blockade. In all my years as an organizer and a direct-action trainer, I had never experienced such a space. Participants dancing at the Mni Wiconi (Water Is Life) Healing Gathering during the week of September 18th, 2017, at Sacred Stone Village. The term Water Protector emerged as a descriptor for those holding space to stop the pipeline. It was a time of spectacular convergence. Centuries-old feuds between Native peoples were put aside, as once-hostile tribes joined the camps, bearing tobacco, firewood, and other gifts. The space was full of songs, history, and potential. From quiet, prayerful marches to complex lockdowns that halted construction equipment, a new chapter of our history was being written, in real time. For Native people, 2016 was a year of tension, hope, and action. The movement at its height wasn't just inspiring, but life-giving. Then we experienced the effort's final defeat. In 2017, the camps were raided, the Dakota Access Pipeline was completed, and oil now flows through the Black Snake. A quiet moment by the fire at Sacred Stone Village. Native organizers sprang into action, arranging rides for hundreds of stranded Water Protectors who had a new task ahead: returning to their lives. Having neglected a great deal for the sake of the movement, some had little to return to. Defeat breeds anguish, and, in the wake of that dispersal, our people were hurting, emotionally and physically. Depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, brought on by militaristic police violence, worsened the ongoing threat of suicide among our young people. On the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, moving on from the camps meant recovering from the closure of Backwater Bridge, which the Department of Transportation had shut down, citing structural concerns, in late October of 2016, and which the sheriff didn't reopen until after the camps were fully evicted. The closure was enforced with a barricade against protesters, who police thought might try to halt pipeline construction, but it also functioned as an economic embargo against the Standing Rock Sioux. The closure added hours to local commutes, whether for work, food, or medicine. Decorating artist and activist Billy McMaster's trailer at Sacred Stone Village. The North Dakota Private Investigative and Security Board filed a suit alleging that these tactics included sending undercover agents into the camps. As someone who was targeted by TigerSwan's rent-a-spy surveillance, I can attest that their efforts contributed to an environment of paranoia and distrust. Some of those divisions remain firmly in place, along with other lasting effects from navigating strategic differences under harsh living conditions while law enforcement launched assaults for months on end. Nevertheless, our longstanding struggles persist, and new efforts continue to emerge. The Makwa Camp, positioned against Line 3 in Minnesota, has drawn hundreds of resistors who now call themselves Water Protectors. Standing Rock's influence can also be found at Camp White Pine, where land defenders are resisting the Mariner East 2 pipeline in rural Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania. And along the Missouri River, as the fight to stop Keystone XL re-energizes, Native activists say they are carrying the lessons, skills, and tactics of the NoDAPL movement forward. Cheyenne activist and discussion leader Raymond Kingfisher (right) speaks to an audience at the Mni Wiconi Healing Gathering. We talked about Standing Rock, what it represented historically, and what it inspired. We talked about ongoing Native struggles, and the energy the movement had brought them. The students made signs and wrote messages of love and appreciation to Native activists. When Raniya, who made that sign, is old enough, there will be new fronts of resistance waiting to welcome her. My hope is that their chances for success will not be dampened by what ultimately happened in Standing Rock. Because whatever else happened in that space, our imaginations were re-armed. In a world that invisiblizes us, we were seen, and, for a moment, we held space together in common cause. An evening gathering at Sacred Stone Village. I believe that we can. Because in that first tiny camp, and in the massive convergence that followed, I saw what we're made of. The completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline broke my heart, but I still believe in us. I believe we can build forward, and learn, and dream, about sovereignty, about ourselves, and about solidarity. We can decide who we are in relation to each other. Because we are not the words on TigerSwan's security reports, or the factions that formed in camp. We are Native people, defined by no one else, and we need not waste another breath on wars our enemies would have us fight. It's time to starve those fires of oxygen, and breathe life into the world we know is possible. We didn't stop the pipeline, but we did seize a page of history from those who would make us disappear. The movement in Standing Rock was a vision of ourselves, as Native people: imperfect, beautiful, alive in the face of colonialism, and still rising.

The gathering has been the largest meeting of Native Americans since the Little Bighorn camp in 1876. Jenni Monet posted Mar 16, 2018 At the height of the movement at Standing Rock, Indigenous teens half a world away in Norway were tattooing their young bodies with an image of a black snake. Derived from Lakota prophecy, the creature had come to represent the controversial Dakota Access pipeline for the thousands of water protectors determined to try to stop it. The Disruption of White Supremacy The Indigenous Collective Using Tattoos to Rise Above Colonialism It was a show of international solidarity between the Indigenous Sami and the Lakota. The backstory can be told simply. Temporary communities of thousands were created on the reservation borderlands in nonviolent resistance against the crude oil project. Police arrested more than 800 people, and many water protectors faced attack dogs, concussion grenades, rubber bullets, and, once, a water cannon on a freezing night in November. Last February, armored vehicles and police in riot gear cleared the last of the encampments. Oil now flows through the pipeline under the Missouri. But this Indigenous-led disruption, the awakening resolve that was cultivated at Standing Rock, did not dissolve after February. Rather, it spread in so many different directions that we may never fully realize its reach. The spirit of resistance can easily be found in the half-dozen or so other pipeline battles across the United States. Beyond that, the movement amplified the greater struggle worldwide: treaty rights, sacred sites, and the overall stand to protect Indigenous land and life. To be sure, post-colonization has always demanded acknowledgment of Indigenous autonomy. He wanted to remind the world that European colonizers had honored Iroquois Confederacy nationhood upon entering treaty agreements under the two row wampum. The story of White Clay, Nebraska, is indicative. There, another fight for justice was mounting, for families living on the neighboring Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. This one focused on a decades-long dispute over beer sales targeted at Native American customers mostly prone to alcohol addiction. Demands turned to broader issues: investigation of dozens of unsolved crimes in White Clay against Native Americans. Matthew had been caretaker of one of the main communities at Standing Rock, and he settled right in at Camp Justice at the edge of Pine Ridge. For all the momentum that the resistance at Standing Rock brought, the Indigenous rights movement in the 21st century faces increasing challenges. Tribal nations tread cautiously under the administration of Donald Trump. Internationally, the militarized protection of extractive energy projects and theft of land persist, despite glaring media attention paid to the rising number of Indigenous peoples killed or jailed for their activism in the face of it. The difference of opinion between the two leaders is a conflict that often lies at the heart of tribal community: protecting the Earth or protecting the Indigenous peoples. On the eve of Thanksgiving 2017, when the Keystone pipeline ruptured and spilled 210,000 gallons of oil in neighboring South Dakota, the newly elected Faith remained notably silent while water protectors responded with outrage, most loudly, closest to home. Sustaining this awakening is the next great task. Like Archambault and other tribal leaders, Frazier was arrested for participating in the Standing Rock occupation. Leadership in the Indigenous world is not only a difficult balance, but also dangerous. In July, she survived an attack by a group of assailants wielding machetes. Just weeks earlier she had been named the new leader of the Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras, the nonprofit organization formerly led by her mother. Last year, after the military-style assaults on the camps at Standing Rock, Human Rights Watch expanded its agenda to include a program focused on the environment as a human right. Meantime, the organization Global Witness reports that it has never been deadlier to take a stand against companies that steal land and destroy the Earth. In 2016, the watchdog group found that nearly four activists a week are murdered fighting against mining, logging, and other extractive resource development. Traditional knowledge has kept us in harmony with Mother Earth. As disturbing as this reality is, it is unsurprising then to recall the military-style violence at Standing Rock: the rows of riot police pointing their guns at unarmed activists standing in the river; tanks shooting water in freezing temperatures at a crowd of people gathered on a bridge. In this one regard, Standing Rock was not unique in the world. It had become crucially important. Sustaining this awakening is the next great task. Climate change poses one of the most serious reminders of why the sacred fires ignited at Standing Rock must continue to burn: Indigenous peoples and their knowledge and value systems matter. The girl who once tended cattle in the region of Chad bordering northeastern Nigeria has now become a bridge for her people and government officials making decisions impacting the fragile ecosystem of Lake Chad, the lifeline for the Mbororo. Jannie Staffansson, a representative of the Saami Council, wants what Chief Deskaheh had petitioned to the League of Nations nearly a century earlier: sovereign recognition for Indigenous Peoples on an international scale. She paused to check the Snapchat account she had been using to engage with a young Sami audience while at COP, a demographic similar to the teens who got tattoos of the black snake. No Paywall.

Thousands had marched to the border at the start of a six-week protest, dubbed the Great March of Return. The Israeli military said soldiers had opened fire after rioting. UN Security Council members meeting in New York have called for an investigation into the violence. Palestinians have pitched five camps near the border for the protest. They are demanding that refugees be allowed to return to homes that are now in Israel. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said there were about 17,000 Palestinians in five locations near the border fence. Although most protesters stayed in the encampments, some groups of youths ignored organisers' calls to stay away from the fence and headed closer to Israeli positions. A spokesman said all those who were killed had been trying to breach or damage the border fence, the Jerusalem Post reports. Israel said it had targeted sites of the Hamas militant group. Israel deployed tanks and snipers. Witnesses said a drone had been used in at least one location to drop tear gas. By Rushdi Abu Alouf, BBC News, Gaza The death toll from Friday's rally is the largest since the last Israeli war on Gaza in the summer of 2014. Since then Gaza has seen a long period of calm but difficult economic conditions and the Israeli blockade may be the final chapter in the four-year truce between Hamas and Israel. Despite the call for peaceful demonstrations, the confrontations involving angry Palestinian youths were not surprising. Young men have been demonstrating near the border with Israel on numerous occasions, but this time Israel's response was exaggerated. Tomorrow, the Palestinians will bury their dead and head back to the border with Israel to throw stones at the soldiers. Hamas, the militant group that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, does not recognise Israel's right to exist but last year said it was ready to accept an interim Palestinian state limited to Gaza and the West Bank. Palestinian health officials said at least 400 people had been wounded by live ammunition. It said one of those killed was a 16-year-old boy. The Israeli military oversees a no-go zone along the Gaza border, citing security concerns, and has doubled its troop presence for the protest. It fears the protest could be an attempt at a mass breach of the border.

The protest is scheduled to end on 15 May, which Palestinians call Nakba (catastrophe) and which marks the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the conflict surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948. Palestinians have long demanded their right to return but Israel says they should settle in a future Palestinian state in Gaza and the West Bank.

It is unclear how many vets may arrive to Standing Rock; some organizers estimate a few dozen are on their way, while other activists are pledging that hundreds could show up in the coming weeks. An estimated 1,000 veterans traveled to Standing Rock in December just as the Obama administration announced it was denying a key permit for the oil company, a huge victory for the tribe.

Vets with post-traumatic stress disorder also suffered in the cold and chaotic environment without proper support, said Matthew Crane, a US navy veteran who is helping coordinate a return group with the organization VeteransRespond. On Friday afternoon, as snow rapidly melted during an unusually warm day in Cannon Ball, Jake Pogue helped organize a vets camp area at Sacred Stone, the first camp that emerged last spring in opposition to the pipeline. Since last fall, police have made roughly 700 arrests, at times deploying water cannons, Mace, rubber bullets, teargas, pepper spray and other less-than-lethal weapons. Private guards for the pipeline have also been accused of violent tactics. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, founder of the Sacred Stone camp and a Standing Rock tribe member, said she welcomed the return of the vets. At Standing Rock, indigenous activists say the mass arrests and police violence have led many of them to develop PTSD, suffering symptoms that many veterans understand well.

Here are some things to consider as you decide what to do. People with skills like nurses and other medics are needed. Check with Oceti Sakowin camp or teams already on the ground to find out. And there is always work to do in the kitchen or chopping wood. If you do go to Standing Rock, remember that this is a movement founded in nonviolence and prayer. Respect the indigenous leaders there and follow their requests about how to behave at camp in keeping with Lakota traditions. But before you pack up your car and head out, consider the snow. You will need to be well-provisioned to avoid becoming a burden on the community there. Many of the organizers have asked White allies to consider whether the money spent to get yourself to Standing Rock would be better spent donating to the cause: covering mounting legal costs, provisioning an indigenous water protector, or helping the Standing Rock tribe pay for costs. You may be a more effective advocate where you are, where you have easy access to elected officials and banks; at Standing Rock, access to phone and internet service is limited. Break up with your bank Banks are feeling the heat from the protests and from their own customers. One bank, DNB of Norway, has responded to pressure by divesting from Energy Transfer, the parent company of the Dakota Access pipeline. The ING Bank of the Netherlands, which prides itself on its sustainability and human rights stance, posted a statement on its website expressing concern about excessive police force at Standing Rock. If your bank is one of the direct investors in DAPL or one of the investors in its parent companies, Energy Transfer and Sunoco Logistics, ask them to withdraw support. Tell them you plan to close your account if their support continues. Photograph yourself cutting up your credit card, or share your letter on your social media networks. Consider planning or participating in a nonviolent protest at a bank branch or headquarters. Sacred Stone Camp has posted a map to find bank branches near you and recommends actions beginning Dec. 1. Banks are risk-averse, and this pipeline project has become quite risky because of public relations problems as well as the oil price bust and reduction of oil extraction in North Dakota. Banks and investors may be hoping for an excuse to back out. Your action could help tip the balance. If your police force is there, call them home. Although the police staffing is changing constantly, some sheriffs have responded to public pressure by refusing to send deputies. Contact elected officials, write to local papers and local blogs, and contact local media to object to law enforcement involvement at Standing Rock. Remind President Obama of this and of the way his decision on DAPL will shape his legacy. You can also call Denis McDonough, White House chief of staff, at 202-456-3182. Contact the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is charged with making a decision about the permit to drill under the Missouri River. Tell them to reject the permit and order a full environmental impact statement. (703) 697-8986 Col. John W.

Remember to speak politely and factually about your concerns. If you send an email, copy it to your social media account to inspire your friends, and to local media. Call out the media If media outlets are ignoring or distorting the news, call them on it. Send open letters and share them on social media. Ask major media to fully and factually cover the unfolding drama at Standing Rock. Donate There are many opportunities to donate cash or supplies. You can raise more money for these and others by organizing support events and fundraisers in your community. Invite people who are curious about the issues as well as people who are already passionately engaged. Make it a celebratory or prayerful event in whatever way makes sense to your community. Other options Phone a bank. Invite friends over to make phone calls and send emails. Resist extraction where you live. Resist but also renew. Remember that as you resist the dystopian world of extraction, Donald Trump, violence, and racism, you can also use your activism to build up the world you want. Resilience for the days ahead When I talk to people at Standing Rock, I feel the trauma and pain but also the resolve. The young people speak of being the Seventh Generation, the ones that were prayed for. And many speak of the suffering they are prepared to endure to ensure the next generations has the clean water they will need to survive.

In lieu of evidence, the State argues that the wearing of masks, black clothing, and even chanting similar chants or smiling while witnessing property destruction all constitute evidence in this regard. If the State succeeds, most of the defendants face literally a life sentence, and the State will be given a dangerous new precedent for future repression. Across the US, we already are starting to see a similar J20 strategy be put into practice. Meanwhile, other states have passed new anti-masks laws, while others are attempting to further criminalize the blockading of roads and oil infrastructure. With the J20 trial, the government is seeking to create a legal precedent that would give them further tools to not only police dissent and protest, but attack social movements and struggles that have grown under the Trump administration. Furthermore, the State is also attempting to punish even journalists and live streamers that were out covering the protests, claiming that they were helping grow the demonstrations while informing would be participants. The government is attempting to use the language of terrorism to prosecute autonomous social movements that use tactics such as street marches, occupations, and blockades. In themselves, this tactics are based around taking over public space, stopping the flows of capital, and shutting down infrastructure. Clearly, these tactics are not aimed at injuring, harming, or killing members of the public. Even black bloc tactics, shutting down of pipelines, and antifascist defense against violent neo-Nazi and Alt-Right groups, while often confrontational, is likewise not aimed at injuring, killing, or harming members of the public. If anything, these tactics are powerful in that they are available to everyone and encourage public participation while create spaces that bring in everyday people and empower them. Clearly, it is because of this reality that the security State is looking to crush autonomous social movements, especially at a time when legitimacy in the State is falling, as is support for both Trump and the Democratic Party. Across the US, from Flint, Michigan to Puerto Rico, Americans are seeing that the government cares more about maintaining control through police force and providing for rich elites than it does with helping everyday people. Instead, the State is concerned with crushing potentially revolutionary movements that are seeking to build a base of support within the working-class and poor communities; the same communities which are under threat from both the State and the far-Right. In doing so, the State finds its interests aligning along with those of the auxiliary insurgent Right, as they both begin to parrot much of the same talking points and conspiracy theories. For the farther that the far-Right can beat the drum of open civil war with autonomous social movements, the more the State can justify cracking down on them. The J20 trial shows this reality to be in full swing, as the prosecution has openly worked with the far-Right and the Alt-Right in several instances, while also pulling from it in order to build its case. Chuck C. Johnson and Nazi Richard Spencer using Twitter to announce doxing their enemies. This release took place only two weeks after the protests, and three days after antifascist and anarchist protesters along with thousands of others, successfully shut down a talk by Milo Yiannopoulos at UC Berkeley, leading to condemnation from President Trump. This August, Spencer was also a key organizer in the disastrous Unite the Right rally, which brought together a variety of Alt-Right, neo-Nazi, and KKK groups. Richard Spencer with Charles C Johnson, the editor of GotNews, at the GOP convention in 2016. GotNews wrote: The list includes more than 200 people of all ages and parts of the country. The spreadsheet of the names released by the site still contains the metadata, which lists Schaerr as the author of the document and MPD as the company. Despite these self accolades, we doubt that Schaerr would have enjoyed being linked publically to aiding a group of neo-Nazi trolls, yet this sharing of information between the Alt-Right and the DC metro police is exactly that. Clearly, people within the police saw a friend within the Alt-Right, which includes open neo-Nazis and white nationalists, and second, they wanted to physically hurt Trump protesters without members of the public knowing about it. Lastly, this move should be seen as what it clearly was, a green light from the State to the auxiliary far-Right to attack enemies of the Trump regime. And at the same time, the Trump administration removed groups on the far-Right from the terrorism watch list, which drew praise from neo-Nazi and Alt-Right commenters. Our memes are all real life. But beyond attacking Trump protesters out of the gate and behind the scenes, moreover the prosecution has also built their case around the media generated by far-Right and Alt-Right groups and personalities. But while the Oath Keeper videos have yet to be shown in court, one video that has been played numerous times, again according to a representative of Defend J20 that has been in court throughout the trial, is that of Alt-Lite vblogger, Lauren Southern. and members of Generation Identity, a white nationalist group. Ironically, Lauren Southern was among those who were swept up and arrested during the J20 protests, however, unlike other journalists, was quickly released without charges. Instead, government attorneys appear to be trying to prosecute him because of his expressed opinions about the protest. Wood, who lives in San Antonio, Texas, was not the only member of the media who was rounded up by police. Unlike Wood, she was released after her arrest. Some of her footage from that day has been used in court against defendants. Today in DC Superior Court Judge Lynn Leibovitz ruled that a journalist can be held liable for property destruction that was captured on his livestream, because of the 'enthusiasm' of his commentary. This is ironic, being that DC Metro Police actively worked with members of the Alt-Right to doxx people that had been arrested on January 20th. The prosecution has also relied heavily on the testimony of Detective Gregg Pemberton of the seventh District. This is horrible and dangerous. Moreover, one police officer from the sevenths District made a comment in court that likened moving protesters in DC to dealing with poor black residents in the Barry Farm neighborhood. Howden said he did not. According to the State, the podcast shows evidence of planning and thus, conspiracy. Clearly we see police and prosecutors working openly with Alt-Right and far-Right players, while also depending on them for evidence and talking points, amid a sea of support for not only Trump and the far-Right fear of black struggle as a violent threat. In this context, we can see the J20 trial for what it is, not an attempt by the State to protect the public from violence, but a blunt tool of repression aimed against the public as a warning, that should anyone step out of line, the full force of the State will be used to smack them down. Drawing Conclusions 2017 will in part be remembered as the year that the far-Right went into the streets to attack, murder, and injure a much larger body of people who oppose white supremacy and fascism. But it should also be remembered as a year in which white nationalist and fascist ideas were mainstreamed by everyone from the President to those in the mass media.

Rivas is a Mexica photographer from Los Angeles who traveled to Cannon Ball, N.D., in August 2016 to document the indigenous-led movement against the Dakota Access pipeline near the border of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. He remained embedded in the main Oceti Sakowin resistance camp for six months, until law enforcement shut it down in late February of this year. Rivas took more than 10,000 photographs while he was there, some of which have appeared in the New York Times, The Guardian and Rolling Stone. Earlier this month he was awarded a fellowship through the Magnum Foundation, a prestigious organization in the world of documentary photography. Rivas was one of a dozen presenters who spoke at the Rapid City Performing Arts Center during TEDxRapidCity, an all-day event that showcased a range of unique ideas in short talks about everything from environmental policy to sociolinguistics. This is the third year that the event has been held in Rapid City. It is important, he noted, that non-Native journalists be present and willing to learn how to interact with indigenous peoples, but if stories are to be told with indigenous peoples at their hearts, then Rivas believes that indigenous voices need to be there to tell them. Helping to encourage and strengthen those voices is the work he wants to throw himself into next as he looks beyond Standing Rock and into the future. The fight against the Dakota Access pipeline began last April and continued for nearly an entire year, bringing together hundreds of tribes in one of the largest gathering of indigenous people in American history. In the final months, the resistance camps along the Missouri River swelled to as many as 10,000 people in size. With construction completed, crude oil from the Bakken Shale formations in North Dakota has begun flowing through the 1,172-mile-long pipeline to a distribution hub in Illinois. The fight to shutdown the pipeline continues in federal court.

Its old version was that Indigenous peoples have always been in the way of progress, their interests a nuisance or threat, their treaties a discardable artifact. In that story, the American heroes forged on these high plains of the west were never the Indians: they were the gold-diggers or gamblers, the cowboys or cavalry. But over the past months, it became impossible to watch peaceful Indigenous people and supporters attacked by snarling dogs, maced, and shot with rubber bullets and water cannons in freezing conditions, and still see in them a threat. It was impossible to look upon these young Indigenous men and women, in jingle dresses or on horseback, and not observe the courage that America desperately needs. It was impossible to listen to the cry of their slogan and not hear a rallying vision for all of us: Water is Life. Along the snowy banks of the Missouri river, a new story is being painfully birthed. It tells us that frontiers must at some point close. That endless taking must become care-taking. And that Indigenous rights, cast aside for too long, are a key to protecting land and water and preventing climate chaos. America is waking up to new heroes. This is not high-minded romanticism. It is hard-bitten reality. Almost everywhere these fossil fuel projects have emerged, Indigenous peoples have been their first and fiercest opponents: the Cheyenne stopping coal in Montana, the Lummi defeating an export terminal in Washington, and throughout my country of Canada, Indigenous peoples standing in the way of mines and tar sands pipelines. Forget all those supposedly progressive heads of state who have touted the Paris climate accord but effectively undermined it with their actions: real climate leaders, those keeping carbon in the ground, are doing so directly on the land. Those with a deep stake in the prevailing economic order cannot have it otherwise. That is why they are poor and America has become rich. That history squats on the present, explaining the continuing brutality toward them. Attempts by the North Dakota state to police them into submission, and then to deny emergency fire and ambulance services and to prevent delivery of supplies and food to the camp, are part of this lineage. Evicting Indigenous peoples from their lands or starving them out: in truth, the Indian wars never ended. But brave activism has shown that an unbroken history of ugliness and violence is never a guarantee of the future. It turns out treaty rights were never a specimen of the past. They were always living and sacred obligations. In ways clear to more and more people, they have also become the most powerful non-violent weapon for a habitable planet. Which means that honouring the treaty and land rights of Indigenous peoples is now not only a long-overdue moral and legal duty: a stable climate depends on it. That is something to remember as Donald Trump and his coterie of climate change-denying corporate lobbyists enter the White House, ready to lift any barriers to fossil fuel extraction. Who can yet tell to what new paths the victory here will lead. These Indigenous rights will, however, never gain their true and full clout without the power of a durable mass movement behind them. The dirt road in the centre of the water protectors camp displaying the flags of an unprecedented coalition of Indigenous nations is one necessary part of any future equation: the unparalleled support among non-Indigenous peoples is the other. The latter must now grow into the kind of power that can turn these rights into economic and political realities that are impossible to ignore. One promising such gesture of solidarity in early November was the astonishing 1.4 million people who symbolically signed into Standing Rock on Facebook. Alongside continuing divestment campaigns against the banks invested in the pipeline and continent-wide solidarity protests, which will continue through December, this is what can permanently turn the tide. So too the building of surprising but all-too-necessary alliances: like the thousands of American war veterans who joined the Standing Rock camp this weekend to act as human shields between the water protectors and the police and army. The story is indeed changing: even the cavalry are defecting, themselves becoming water protectors. With the White House soon to be taken over by Trump, the Dakota Access pipeline company may yet be approved next year. Even the environmental review now mandated may still end up green-lighting the current pipeline route. There is a great fight ahead. But a sense of hope and possibility loomed large at the water protectors camp, where celebrations with song and fireworks continued late into Sunday. According to the older story many of us know best, the routing of Indians was an inevitable step to civilizational advance. This time, if they lose, we all do. This time, Indians are winning.

Several dams are scheduled to be removed in 2020, but a proposed pipeline has raised fears that construction and leaks could threaten a revitalized river. For millenniums, the Klamath, Modoc and Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians fished salmon from the lake and the river. After dams were built on the river starting in 1912, the salmon were blocked. The Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline would run 229 miles from Malin to Coos Bay, Ore., crossing underneath the Klamath River near the city of Klamath Falls. It would extend, via interconnections, the Ruby Pipeline, carrying natural gas from Wyoming to a huge planned storage and export terminal for sales to countries in the Pacific Rim. The company behind the pipeline, Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline LP, and the export terminal, Jordan Cove Energy Project LP, are both owned by the Pembina Pipeline Corporation, based in Calgary, Alberta. Now the companies are trying again, though the commission said they had failed to show there was market demand for the project. Image A protest in 2016 against Jordan Cove LNG and its plan to build the Pacific Connector natural gas pipeline in Oregon. If the pipeline gets built, the initial construction jobs will disappear as soon as it is done. As far as the Klamath people are concerned, this pipeline is a bad idea even if the price of gas were predicted to skyrocket. The Klamath people oppose this project because it puts at risk their watersheds, forests, bays, culture, spiritual places, homes, climate and future. If the pipeline catches fire or leaks, the Klamath River and its fish will be put at risk. The track record of fossil fuel pipelines suggests such a calamity is only a matter of time. Though natural gas generates lower greenhouse gas emissions than coal, it is still a fossil fuel. Leaks during extraction, transport and burning of gas all contribute to climate change. Notably, several state agencies do have the power to deny permits and stop the pipeline from being built. The Klamath Tribes, along with the Yurok and Karuk, hundreds of landowners, conservation groups, and concerned citizens, have registered as intervenors to have legal standing to dispute this pipeline. Just as the tribes along the river shared the salmon in the old days, those tribes will work together to protect their shared river today. As long as this proposal hangs over the river, the Klamath will stand in fierce, firm and unwavering opposition. Don Gentry is the chairman of the Klamath Tribes. not diverted by dams flows back into the Klamath River near Keno, Ore. not diverted by dams flows back into the Klamath River near Keno, Ore.

Statement from sub.Media: The emboldened right-wing is mobilizing to turn back collective gains won over years of struggle by the exploited and oppressed. Indigenous land defenders fighting to limit the ecological devastation of their territories by the energy industry are met with less-lethal bullets and mass arrests. Paranoia and confusion run rampant in an information landscape where facts are dismissed as fake news. Faced with a crisis of reality itself, millions have retreated into social media echo chambers, helping cement divisions between people with common cause and impeding the communication necessary to effect meaningful change. Against this prevailing pessimism and despair, anarchists and anti-fascists have burst back into the popular imagination. With capitalism in a profound state of crisis and transition, our alternative political visions and our consistent critiques of power are capturing the attention of disillusioned people all over the world. We hope this project can serve as a tool for provoking meaningful discussion and debate within our movements. Towards that end, Trouble is intended to be screened in group settings that foster affinity and collaboration, in hopes of helping to spark local and regional organizing initiatives.

They state: 'The decision to issue an easement allowing the pipeline to cross under the Missouri River north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation is a direct response to President Trump's January 24 Presidential Memorandum urging the Army Corps to expedite the review and approval process. Suspending the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process previously ordered by the Obama Administration, which would have determined the safety, environmental and climate impacts of the pipeline and alternative route crossings, is morally unacceptable. It is particularly troubling given the Army Corps' previous determination that the pipeline crossing affects tribal treaty rights and that more study and consultation with tribes is required. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the Missouri Tribal Nations have raised significant concerns about potential threats to their water supply and their legitimate rights as sovereign governments to be consulted and heard in the permitting process. Lake Oahe and the Missouri River provide drinking water for the tribe and surrounding regions and millions of people living downstream from the project. We stand in solidarity with native peoples in Standing Rock and around the world who are advocating for environmental and human rights in the face of extractive industry projects. This is just another example of the many countless acts of genocide, racism and injustices that the indigenous peoples of this continent have endured for the last 500 years. We invite people of good will, as well as members of Congress to call on the Administration to reverse this decision and we applaud those members of the House and Senate Natural Resources Committees who have done so. Red Cloud Indian School, Inc. is a multifaceted, faith-based nonprofit impacting the families and children of the Oglala Lakota people of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in southwest South Dakota. Administered since 1888 by the Jesuits and the Lakota people, Red Cloud operates three schools (Red Cloud High School, Red Cloud Elementary School, and Our Lady of Lourdes Elementary), with roughly 600 students on two campuses. Red Cloud also assists the Lakota Catholic churches spread across the roughly 5,000 square miles of the Reservation. Through The Heritage Center, Red Cloud invites the preservation and celebration of the artistic expression of Lakota and other Native American peoples. St Francis Mission, a nonprofit founded in 1886, is a ministry of the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) among the 26,000 Lakota (Sioux) people on the Rosebud Indian Reservation in south-central South Dakota. The purpose of the Mission is to re-evangelize Catholic Lakota people and bring the Gospel of Jesus to those who have not heard it. The Mission, which supports work in six parishes, the Icimani Ya Waste Recovery Center, the White River Recovery Center, Sapa Un Catholic Academy, the Religious Education Center in Rosebud, a dental clinic, the Buechel Memo- rial Lakota Museum, and KINI Radio 96.1 FM, respects the traditions of the Lakota people by collaborating with them to meet the spiritual, educational, social and physical needs of the community.

She shares her experiences, and we hear from reflections from other Native people on the front lines. 2. The water protectors' direct actions are peaceful. This week's high-profile intervention was not the first time unarmed protesters have encountered police violence. Keene says part of the reason for the strong solidarity among Native tribes across the country is because the dispute over the the pipeline is part of a long-standing fight to have the sovereignty of their nations respected by the US government. These lands that the pipeline is cutting through right now are their homeland from time immemorial.. One advantage, however, is that Native people from the Plains are teaching the folks from warmer climates how to adapt, using lots of traditional methods from bonfires to longhouses. 6. Wellness teepees are helping campers deal with their mental and physical stress. This is not a Burning Man vibe. There is a protocol for how to enter these spaces, how to earn trust and eventually participate, according to Keene. Everyone has a job to do. 9.

Seattle NoDAPL protesters rally outside downtown Wells Fargo A GoFundMe page claims that 2,100 veterans are on the roster. Washington State Veterans for Standing Rock is composed of military veterans who plan to go out to the Standing Rock demonstration. Though, Hunter is clear that he does not consider the event a demonstration or a protest. These are water protectors. They are peacefully, prayfully, protecting their lands and the rights of the people around them and downstream from them. Washington state veterans and Standing Rock Thousands remain camped out in the snow to opposed the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. And about 2,000 US military veterans are expected to join the opposition. Washington state veterans will be among that crowd. But it runs across land the Standing Rock reservation depends on and considers sacred. Their oppositions has been met with private security and police forces. They will bring cold weather gear and some body armor as rubber bullets tend to harden in freezing weather. One of the reasons why the veterans are doing this is because we are used to being hit and being disciplined about it.

Tracy Loeffelholz Dunn posted Nov 07, 2016 Updated Nov. 17 Not two weeks after one of the major banks funding the Dakota Access and Bakken pipeline companies said it may withhold its funding over concerns for the treatment of the Standing Rock Sioux, it announced Nov. 17 that it has sold off all assets in the companies. But the sudden divestment can be seen as an indication of which way the Norway bank is leaning. DNB is one of a handful of banks out of a total 38 that has offered funding to all Energy Transfer entities, including direct loans to Dakota Access. Several CEO email addresses have been changed. The Standing Rock controversy recently intensified as thousands have gathered in North Dakota to help the Standing Rock Sioux protect the area from pipeline construction. The pipeline is nearing the stage at which it would pass under the Missouri River, a drinking water supply for 18 million people. The Army Corps of Engineers has refused to give the pipeline the easement it needs, and Energy Transfer has filed a federal lawsuit compelling the government to do so. People power is winning. The news that DNB has sold its assets and is considering terminating its loans is a victory for the water protectors who are fighting to stop this disaster of a project. All financial institutions with a stake in the pipeline must quickly realize that financing this project is toxic. It would be smart for them to get out ahead of the growing movement of customers looking to divest from banks that finance the destruction of our planet and ignore Indigenous rights and sovereignty. The Bakken pipeline includes the 1,170-mile Dakota Access pipeline plus a 700-mile pipeline from the end of the Dakota Access, in Illinois, to refineries and export facilities in Texas. No Paywall.

On February 22, the Oceti Oyate camp, formerly known as Oceti Sakowin, as well as all other camps on treaty land claimed by the US Army Corps, were ordered to evacuate by 2pm. Hundreds flocked back to Standing Rock to pray as the company resumed drilling under the Missouri River following the granting of the final easement by the US Army Corps on February 7th. Ten unarmed water protectors were arrested and one was badly injured in a violent crackdown. Several of those arrested were journalists and legal observers, clearly targeted for their role in documenting police violence and rights violations. One water protector was tazed Fires kept law enforcement from entering the camps, but they continue to build presence at Standing Rock, preparing to forcibly remove water protectors from unceded territory affirmed in the 1851 and 1868 Ft. Laramie Treaties as sovereign land of the Great Sioux Nation. A contingent of nearly two dozen National Park Service rangers and U.S. Park Police officers arrived at the request of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe with tactical gear ranging from gas masks and riot gear to rifles, protective vests, and night vision goggles. The Sacred Stone Camp is standing ground, but raids on the remaining camps could happen at any moment. If you witnessed an arrest today at Standing Rock, are arrested, or are concerned about the possible arrest of a relative or loved one, please call the legal jail support line: 605.519.8180. With law enforcement preparing to advance, the legal teams are standing by (Freshet Collective and Water Protector Legal Collective - www.waterprotectorlegal.org ) and will continue to work around the clock to support and stand in solidarity with water protectors. Over 700 water protectors are now fighting criminal cases, and North Dakota is handing down convictions. Six people face federal charges, which carry sentences of up to 15 years. At least one grand jury is active and issuing indictments. Federal agents are knocking on doors at the homes of water protectors and their families. Meanwhile, reactionary legislation targeting water protectors continues to advance through the North Dakota House and Senate. The legal defense of those needing support is going to take a long time, possibly years, and will be very expensive. We are very grateful for your support. The runners delivered 140,000 petition signatures to the US Army Corps of Engineers and rallied at the White House to ask President Obama to pressure them to repeal the water crossing permits. The threats this pipeline poses to the environment, public health, and tribal and human rights are strikingly similar to those posed by the Keystone XL. We are not expendable.

Others have promised that they will express their solidarity with protests throughout the country. However, last month Trump decided to revive the decree with which is approved the construction of this work that they consider predatory to the environment and destructive to its ancient habitat. This nation currently has 28,000 members. Now, they denounce that United States immigration police have unleashed a war against them, therefore they warned that they would mobilize against the border wall they want to construct. The Yaqui Tribe shares territory in the state of Sonora in Mexico and in Arizona, in the United States. Bring down the wall by constructing resistance with workers, indigenous peoples and women on both sides of the border. From Standing Rock to the Sierra Norte of Puebla: indigenous peoples join together in defense of territory The campesino, indigenous and mestizo peoples of the Northeast Sierra of Puebla have demonstrated, once again, their capacity for organization and self-determination. As is now the custom in this region, every other month, and now on February 18, hundreds of people came from 173 towns and 16 municipalities to gather together in the 18th Assembly in Defense of Territory to reaffirm the power to decide on their lives and the destiny of their territories. According to what the web page Hijos de la Tierra has reported, those installations are destined to favor mining megaprojects, fracking and hydroelectric dams in la region. The municipal presidency of Cuetzalan and representatives of the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE, its initials in Spanish) were invited to the meeting so that they could provide information about the motive and objectives of the electric project that they want to develop at that place. They did not attend however and therefore the assembly decided to continue stopping the construction work and to maintain the encampment installed since the month of November. II. account.

The city will be stuck with the megabank for at least another year. Wells Fargo is one of two American banking titans that is directly lending to Dakota Access LLC. It has given the companies involved in the project close to half a billion dollars in funding, much of it in the form of direct project loans for the pipeline.

But the poll also finds that support for the pipeline expansion has actually grown in B.C. since November, while opposition has slightly dropped. The support for the project grew by three per cent since the last Insights West poll on the issue was done in November 2017. Opposition declined by one per cent. But it has been suggested that Stewart himself has been actively encouraging public protests and civil disobedience. Activists and First Nations have warned of civil disobedience on the scale of the Clayoquot Sound War in the Woods of the 1990s, which resulted in 900 arrests, and more recent Standing Rock protests over the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota, which ended with the National Guard being brought in to dismantle a protest camp. He wanted some hard data to impress upon his fellow parliamentarians in Ottawa just how serious the situation could get. While Burnaby is expected to be ground zero in anti-pipeline protests, Stewart believes there could be protests elsewhere in B.C. as well, especially among First Nations who are in the pipeline corridor. According to Kinder Morgan Canada (TSX:KML), about 50 agreements have been signed with First Nations along the pipeline corridor. But even within those communities that have signed benefits agreements, there are likely to be small but ardent factions of First Nations who disagree with their leaders. Stewart said he would support pipeline expansions that went to Eastern Canada, but only if it were to supply Canadian refineries. He would not support pipelines intended to export Alberta oil, like the Energy East pipeline proposal. That proposal has since been scrapped by TransCanada Corporation (TSX:TRP), which is now focused on the resurrected Keystone XL pipeline expansion. Linkedin Created with Sketch.

This pipeline is a threat to Native heritage, their homes, and will be a climate disaster. They predictably end in people being hurt. This is not accidental. It is a deliberate policy of police chiefs at the national level to discourage protests. No matter what the organizers claim in the requests for people to join the demonstration, it will always include a few people who will throw things at the police to justify a police charge against the protesters. It makes no difference if these people are undercover agents or not; the end result will be the same. Protests should be a thing of the past. They have been de facto criminalized and anyone attending a so-called peaceful, non-violent protest is an fool. The establishment never changes a policy as a response to a protest. They see it as a police problem to be solved by hiring more police, giving them more power, and handing down harsher punishments. . FORGET PROTESTS and start thinking of other things to do.

This year it was reported that 5,000 came, with people lining up at 2:30 in the morning to get on the first ferry at 4:30 am. Members of Native American tribes from around California and the West were well represented, but there were Indigenous people from other parts of the U.S. and the Americas as well. This gathering has always been diverse, with people and families of all colors and ethnicities, young and old, coming from nearby and far away. This year was no exception. And this year, all were in proud support of the courageous and determined struggle of the Native people in Standing Rock, North Dakota, against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). Among those speaking were people who had been part of the struggle at Standing Rock and others who were headed there. People spoke of how the struggle at Standing Rock has brought Native peoples together in a way they have never seen before. Some said they were leaving soon with food, warm clothing, and other supplies for the brave resisters at Standing Rock. A resounding boo went up at her reference to President-elect Donald Trump.

In 1975, Peltier was at an AIM camp at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota that helped people at the reservation defend themselves against a campaign of terror by the U.S. government that led to the deaths of 64 AIM members and supporters.

A two-time Academy Award-winning actor Fonda has been an activist for many decades. She supported the Civil Rights Movement and opposed the Vietnam War in the 1960s. Judy Wicks, a local food advocate and former owner of White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia, explained she decided to organize a Thanksgiving meal with a 50-person delegation that includes Fonda. However, Wicks decided to bring a Thanksgiving meal to Standing Rock after Tom Goldtooth, the Director of the Indigenous Environmental Network, told her that his friends at Standing Rock celebrate the American holiday, Civil Eats reported. This year, the meal will include pasture-raised turkeys which will be spit-roasted, and dishes made from native ingredients including squash, sweet potatoes, wild rice, corn and cranberries, Civil Eats reported. Here's a photo of Stanton with beef, not turkey, which will be spit-roasted and served on Thursday. But the idea of an idyllic meal is false to begin with.

Jimerson grew up on the Seneca territories of Allegany and Cattaraugus in Western New York and attended public school. Though Jimerson opposes romanticized views of Thanksgiving, the holiday isn't completely worthless in his eyes. He said he'll be surrounded by loved ones, learning how to make coveted family dishes and cherishing his day off from graduate school. He enjoys making candied yams, a dish his grandmother taught him to prepare. Sort of. Jimerson explained acknowledging that native people have a rich history of plant breeding is one way to honor their food culture. But honoring America's relationship with indigenous people shouldn't be limited to one day a year, and neither should the Thanksgiving ritual of showing gratitude, he noted.

In an earlier piece, I looked at the lessons of Standing Rock for progressive philanthropy writ large. Tilsen, a citizen of the Oglala Lakota Nation, is an organizer at Standing Rock, and has been assisting the movement with communications and fundraising efforts. 'Standing Rock is a Microcosm' Both individual donors and a set of committed foundations played an important role in fueling the resistance to the pipeline (see more coverage here), providing support for things like daily operations of the camp, trainings, legal expenses and communications. But an important takeaway from Standing Rock is that when it comes to the needs of that community, and Native communities as a whole, the philanthropic response has really only scratched the surface. As the movement readies for its next stage following the Army Corps decision, the Stand with Standing Rock website continues to be a reliable entry point for donating to the tribe, following updates, and finding nonprofit partners involved. But even setting aside the Dakota Access pipeline, the Standing Rock Sioux community was extremely vulnerable in the first place, enduring some of the highest poverty, childhood mortality, and dropout rates in the nation. When high-profile resistance moments happen, even with a spike in donations, communities are often left to rebuild and bear the burden. Beyond the pipeline fight, the community is working to develop a positive vision for its future. Members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe are developing new funding mechanisms to support long-term investments such as wind and solar energy, sustainable housing, job creation, education, and language preservation. For the time being, Thunder Valley CDC, which has existing capacity and infrastructure, has served as a conduit for foundations like Surdna and the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation to fund this type of work. There are also a number of organizations that were crucial during the protests; for example, the Standing Rock Youth Council, International Indigenous Youth Council, Indigenous Environmental Network, and IP3, which will need continuing support to expand their impact, Tilsen said. Among foundations that responded to Standing Rock, a similar hope has emerged that overall philanthropic support for Native communities will increase. Aside from the need in Native communities, Standing Rock has demonstrated the power of an indigenous-led environmental movement, which brought a unique outlook and resilience to the issues involved. The protests also rallied activists from several geographies and causes, with groups like Black Lives Matter and labor unions recognizing and responding to shared issues. The organization held an educational tour of Standing Rock for funders in October, and holds periodic funder strategy calls. Standing Rock can be seen as both a culmination and an entry point for longstanding Native issues. Tilsen at Thunder Valley CDC noted a number of places where funders can get involved. In addition to organizations mentioned above, he recommends reaching out to peer funders who are already committed to Native-led groups such as the Northwest Area Foundation and the Bush Foundation, as well as newer arrivals like the Solutions Project and Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation. There are also funder intermediaries like the First Nations Development Institute and the Seventh Generation Fund that can serve an educational role. Ultimately, Tilsen hopes philanthropy will recognize that the equity problems facing Native communities are problems we all share, and that Native people must be center stage, not an afterthought, in the country's equity movement.

Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. DR. DR. I went to the protest site to participate in the protests. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: I believe it was August 12th. And so, there had already been some people arrested prior to that, trying to stop the machines from going onto the land just north of the Oceti Sakowin camps. That was actually before the camp had really started. But the Sacred Stone Camp had been there since April. So I went there just with the intent of participating as any citizen would concerned about our environment. DR. And so there were people that were collected along the road that were praying, and they were singing and saying different, you know, protest chants, basically. And there were community members of all ages and all races there to help us, you know, voice our opposition to what was going on. DR. You know, the decisions that are made regarding pipelines in North Dakota, those decisions have to go through the Public Service Commission. And so, we were first aware of the Dakota Access pipeline route in 2014, is when I became aware. And so, the company had notified the tribe of the route they were going to take, and, you know, there were probably about 50 of us community members that attended and voiced our opposition at that time to the route. The confluence of the rivers right there had created many stones that were sacred to our community members, to our people, and had been used in spiritual ways for hundreds of years. There are other stories of when our people had to flee the Army and the cavalry of places that they would cross, and those are historic places, as well. The graves and the stone effigies that are in that area are also important to our community members. DR. I was there, but I had already been arrested previously, and so I was one of the people named in the SLAPP suit with a restraining order. So, I actually was there, but I had to stay a hundred feet away. AMY GOODMAN: Explain what that SLAPP suit is. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: So, the SLAPP suit, basically, it named several people, including the tribal chairman and other tribal councilmen and several other people, but then they added on Jane and John Doe onto that. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: Because we had already previously been arrested and identified. Like, the charge that I was charged with was disorderly conduct. AMY GOODMAN: So, explain what you did that day, on August 12th. DR. And so, the actions that I was involved with that day were to protest the company using our treaty lands to facilitate building a pipeline, which threatens our way of life. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: Yes, the Army Corps of Engineer lands are included in our treaty territory. And that includes the lands that the Army Corps has claimed are their lands, as well. AMY GOODMAN: That created Lake Oahe. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: Yes, that created Lake Oahe and Lake Sakakawea up on Three Affiliated territory. DR. We know that there are people around the world that are also fighting to keep their waters clean and fighting for the health of their families and community members. I want my children to have clean water. And we have communities all across South Dakota that depend on this river also. AMY GOODMAN: I was speaking with a non-Native person who had come to the reservation casino to see a concert, and I asked him what he thought about the pipeline. DR. And so, the safest way is for us to change to renewable energy. And North Dakota should be in the lead of harnessing that wind energy. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: How that relates is that the state of North Dakota and the Public Health Department and the Public Service Commission had recently voted to raise the level of radioactive waste in the state of North Dakota, the level that could be stored here. The companies, a lot of times, have been using subcontractors who were dumping radioactive waste just in random warehouses. So those are things that we have to be aware of and continuing to fight against the lack of regulation of these environmental waste products in North Dakota and the lack, really, of a public health discussion in our state, that have not been given a voice in the Public Service Commission process or really a voice in the media, either. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: Right now those SLAPP suits had been dismissed. And so will many of the water protectors, as well. DR. DR. AMY GOODMAN: Thank you. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: Yes. We see a pattern of corporations doing this. DR. Stay with us.

But last year as the oil pipeline began operations, authorities jailed him and charged him with felonies stemming from his involvement in the demonstrations. The cases stemmed from clashes with police in late 2016 when thousands gathered at Oceti Sakowin and other campsites by the pipeline, facing a highly militarized operation, brutal shows of force, mass arrests and widely condemned jail conditions.

Photograph: Courtesy of Leoyla Cowboy Under Trump, who has had financial ties with the pipeline company, the US Department of Justice has pressed forward with six cases against Native Americans. North Dakota prosecutors meanwhile have pursued more than 800 state cases against people at Standing Rock, including 165 still pending, according to the Water Protector Legal Collective, a legal support team. More than 140 people were arrested. We got their attention, and they are scared of us If the men were convicted, they faced a mandatory minimum of 10 years. Activists argued the charges were excessive, and some thought the men would prevail in a courtroom, especially considering reporting by the Intercept, which uncovered how a private security firm had used military-style counter-terrorism methods to target and infiltrate the protests. But the defendants and their attorneys ultimately had concerns about the risks of a trial. Red Fawn Fallis was originally accused of shooting at law enforcement, facing a potential life sentence. The case moved forward even after it was reported that a paid informant for the FBI had developed a romantic relationship with her during the protests and was the owner of the gun she allegedly fired. Prosecutors eventually dropped the charge in exchange for her pleading to lesser offenses, and on Monday, she is expected to receive a seven-year prison sentence. Rattler, who is expected to get three years in prison, said the pending case meant he was restricted from freely traveling to indigenous ceremonies and other events. But her husband has been incarcerated since last March when police pulled them over and arrested him while the newlyweds were traveling to an indigenous march in Washington DC. With sentencing over, there was some relief in knowing he would eventually come home, Cowboy said. But she also recognized that there would be lasting consequences. While she was inspired to see the momentum from Standing Rock spread to other fights, she said, it sometimes felt like those still suffering from the North Dakota movement had been left behind."}, {"URL": "http://enoughisenough14.org/2017/04/01/italy-repression-worsens-against-activists-fighting-tap-gas-pipeline", "Timestamp": "20180919001544", "Sentences": "In extraordinary scenes the non-violent protest has been dealt with by sending in a full force of armoured riot police and soldiers, who have intimidated and bullied protesters as they blocked the site entrance before eventually hauling them away. 3.

Just minutes earlier, she and the rest of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe learned that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers won't grant an easement that would have allowed construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) to cross under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River. Her joy is tangible, her infectious laugh punctuating every sentence. Klein asks her how she feels about the news. Then, she breaks down in tears. It's a short video, just over a minute long. Now, young Native American activists are looking ahead, focused on the very future Iron Eyes mentioned. While Sunday's victory is historic and certainly cause for celebration, Indigenous people have quickly called for continued vigilance, especially from young activists on social media. She says there's been an atmosphere of celebration as well as apprehension over the past few days, especially because they don't know what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Sunday's decision was made by the Obama administration, which will transition power to an administration that supports the completion of the pipeline project. But we must remain cautious, Trump is right next in line. And many activists and water protectors say the good news won't erase the reported human rights abuses that have taken place. While Reuters reported that Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, asked those who are not Sioux to leave the area for the winter on Tuesday, water protectors aren't planning to leave anytime soon. In March, when they heard about plans to reroute the Dakota Access Pipeline away from Bismarck and through sacred land, they took action. As part of the Standing Rock Youth, a group of about 30 young people from the Standing Rock Sioux community, they decided to go online, and make their issue known. By now, it has more than 460,000 signatures, including endorsements from celebrities and influencers like Leonardo DiCaprio, Shailene Woodley, Bill McKibben and Ndaba Mandela. And those are the very people they wanted to galvanize. Native American Kids Standing Up Against Big Oil Company. READ, SIGN & SHARE our petition. On July 15, the group also organized a 2,000-mile relay race to Washington, D.C. to deliver their petition. That same day, the camp received notice that construction on the pipeline would begin. Like the young people before her, Ladonna Brave Bull Allard grabbed her iPhone, made a video and posted it to Facebook. While Native-led news outlets, such as The Last Real Indians and Indian Country Today, have covered the pipeline and its threat of sacred land since the beginning, most mainstream news outlets didn't give the story attention until August. That's when thousands of water protectors and allies assembled to physically block construction, and when the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia heard the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's lawsuit. Since then, the movement's grown exponentially. When the situation at Standing Rock became especially tense in September, as North Dakota law enforcement unleashed dogs and pepper spray on water protectors, those at Standing Rock uploaded videos to Facebook and Twitter to show the rest of the world what was happening. In October, Native American activists and allies started using Facebook Live and other videos on the social network to further broadcast standoffs with police. She witnessed, in real-time, a police officer macing her little sister in the Youth Council with a large canister for an extended period of time. And they seemed pretty shaken by that. The tool, Wise says, has allowed large numbers of people to understand what's actually happening on the ground. Later that month, thousands of allies started checking in to the Standing Rock Reservation on Facebook, in an attempt to confuse police after rumors that they were monitoring the social network to keep track of water protectors. However, local law enforcement denied this, which meant the effort, while well-intentioned, didn't achieve what allies hoped. Dallas Goldtooth (Mdewakanton Dakota and Dine), an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, told Mashable in October that he felt the Facebook check-ins actually helped generate support. Beyond media attention, the impact of these social media campaigns is felt within Indigenous communities, too. Wise says the movement has very much been about the youth reclaiming their own power, especially since many elders may not live to see the true impact of their decisions. But it's also about showing the incredible solidarity across various Indigenous communities that have converged on Standing Rock, and the powerful moments they share. The wide sentiment among activists is that it's a temporary victory, especially as a Trump administration looms. That includes further honing their social media skills. Wise says one thing Indigenous youth and other water protectors have learned is to make hard copies of everything they post online. They've encountered instances in which Facebook has removed posts, or technical issues randomly shorten or delete posts. They're also learning how best to navigate Facebook's algorithm, working to make sure people can see what's happening in real-time and remain educated. The fight is NOT OVER. Let's kill the Black Snake. The Sacred Stone Camp released a series of 10 questions water protectors encourage everyone to ask in the coming days and weeks, including when the Army Corps will conduct an Environmental Impact Statement, and to what extent will there be tribal input.

For now, water protectors at Standing Rock are standing firm, showing no signs of going anywhere and making sure their allies know the fight isn't over. I don't know. And that uncertainty is terrifying. But she also feels that the water protectors' prayers have gotten stronger. For the foreseeable future, they still will. youth used social media savvy to start the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline.

To see a video of the militarized assault on one camp by police, see this link. And on November 25th, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a letter to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe warning that the military will forcibly displace the main camp of water protectors and allies on December 5th. For more than 200 years, since the United States government claimed ownership over enormous stretches of Indigenous territory with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the Oceti Sakowin have defended the Mni Soce against poisoning by resource extraction corporations, commodity transportation infrastructure, and its agents in the US Army Corps of Engineers and private resource extraction corporations. This fall Oceti Sakowin are protecting the river, and the water it carries, against its latest threat, the Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline, which Oceti Sakowin land defenders call the black snake, is being pushed by Energy Transfer Crude Oil Company, LLC to move crude oil from oil fields in Three Forks North Dakota to a terminus in Illinois, where the crude would be shipped to refineries. Land defenders are stopping the pipeline from crossing underneath the Mni Soce. The defense of this site has stopped the construction of the pipeline, blocked the shipping of crude oil, and therefore interrupted the accumulation of the wealth of the land from Indigenous nations by a capitalist corporation through colonial means. Alliance Against Displacement supports this interruption of capital accumulation. Alliance Against Displacement (AAD) fights capitalism and colonialism because we believe that in Canada and the United States both non-Native working class and Indigenous people cannot successfully struggle against one force without struggling against the other. Our activist strategy is to engage and support community struggles across Turtle Island against displacement and dispossession. Most of our day-to-day community struggles face this two-headed snake in its capitalist form: urban (and suburban) displacement. Because of the pressing demands of these community struggles that occupy our time and therefore often dominate our political perspectives, we talk and write a lot about gentrification, mass evictions, police brutality and harassment, poverty, and the rule of private property as a dehumanizing force in the lives of our communities. From these mostly urban places in western Canada, on paved over but still embattled territories of the Coast Salish people, we declare that the fight to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is inseparable from our daily struggles. Rather than cancel the pipeline, the Dakota Access company redirected it through a sacrifice zone. What is currently happening at Standing Rock must be situated within a broad context and history. It also constitutes a specific and significant moment of conflict with colonialism, convergence between Indigenous nations, and solidarity from non-Native activists. Image credit: Adam Alexander Johansson Continuation of colonialism and the continuation of resistance The state violence at Standing Rock is a continuation of colonialism, and the resistance against it must continue. We oppose the building of this pipeline and all others that would cross Indigenous territories without free, prior, informed consent. We oppose the police violence used against the people and against the land at Standing Rock. We support all water protectors and land defenders. We honour and thank those who are putting their lives on the line to save the land and Mni Soce. We will continue to resist the continuation of colonial violence and accumulation.

For the hundreds of people camping near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in opposition of the Dakota Access pipeline, winter has arrived in full force. The view from a nearby hill, looking down on the Oceti Sakowin camp in North Dakota, shows a blanket of snow with teepees, tents, RVs and refurbished buses peeking out. Children toboggan down the hill. A snowman holds an anti-pipeline flag. Volunteers stack firewood. Diana Barker plans to eventually rebuild her makeshift tent home at the Oceti Sakowin Camp near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. But she has been here for three weeks, helping to provide food, coffee and warm clothes to others staying in the camp. Yes. Not a chance. Theresa Burns, originally from Pine Ridge, S.D., has been here off and on since September. She has an RV that she is planning to insulate with bales of straw and isn't planning on leaving any time soon. Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners is behind the 1,885-kilometre Dakota Access pipeline, which, if completed, will cross four American states, carrying Bakken oil from North Dakota to Illinois. The largest of the anti-pipeline protest camps is the Oceti Sakowin Camp, located just north of the Cannonball River. Others say the pipeline is safer than moving oil by other modes of transportation, such as rail. For months, thousands of people have descended upon a handful of camps in the area to voice opposition to the pipeline. The largest is the Oceti Sakowin Camp, north of the Cannonball River. Standing Rock pipeline protesters repelled by force at bridge crossing TD scholarship recipient calls on bank to stop funding Dakota Access In the past week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the federal land on which the Oceti Sakowin Camp sits, and North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple have both issued evacuation orders. They point to the onslaught of a harsh winter, the need to protect the public from violent confrontations between law enforcement and protesters, and a lack of ability to effectively provide proper emergency services in the area. asked Barker, questioning the public safety rationale. She is referring to a recent confrontation where protesters were hosed down with water in freezing temperatures by law enforcement. Protesters say they've also been hit with rubber bullets and tear gas. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier says officers only use reasonable force. There have been 563 arrests since Aug. 10, Kirchmeier said, mostly of people from outside North Dakota, including some Canadians. Authorities say they won't be stopping vehicles heading to the prohibited camps, nor will they block supplies of food, water and clothing. What we don't want is confrontation. N.D. officials back away from Standing Rock blockade plans Neil Young calls on Obama to end 'violence' at pipeline protest The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has publicly stated it will not forcibly remove people from the area. Neither will Morton County police. Kirchmeier says it is up to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to figure out how to remove people from the area. Still, some say they are staying until the end.

As a snowy drizzle fell on the gathering march packed into G Street NW, organizers had to move the front of the march up the block a number of times to accommodate the new forces arriving from every bus and metro stop in the area. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers headquarters has been the site of numerous protests in the battle against DAPL because of the Corps' role in ignoring treaties and the law as the project was fast-tracked and rerouted so Energy Transfer Partners could complete its pipeline. The Corps did nothing to stop construction until December 2016, just as U.S. military veterans were joining the Standing Rock camp, vowing to defend the water protectors from an imminent eviction order. In order to avoid scenes of militarized North Dakota police and sheriffs fighting military vets, the Corps suddenly demanded an environmental impact study--which it had not ordered earlier, in contradiction to its own standard practices. The announcement about the impact study was seen as an important victory in the fight against DAPL. However, under pressure from the new Trump administration, in late January, the Corps reversed itself and issued a permit necessary for drilling under the Missouri River to complete a critical section of the pipeline. In February, the Corps and the Standing Rock Tribal Council agreed that protest camps near the reservation would be cleared. At several locations, law enforcement had parked K-9 units--an unusual sight for marches of this size in D.C. and a provocation to water protectors following a police-dog attack in North Dakota last year. There was also a special anger among marchers for Donald Trump. As the demonstration turned up Pennsylvania Avenue, a squad of protestors carrying poles and canvas ran ahead to the Trump International Hotel to erect a tipi in defiance of the obscene display of profits over people. For the next 30 minutes, marchers chanted, sang and drummed outside the hotel. Many of the marchers had traveled hundreds of miles to join the Native Nations Rise events. People like him will do anything for a buck. Money is what is important, not people. It should be the other way around: People should be important. Cindy Schunk and her daughter, of the Yankton Sioux, came from just six miles downriver from Standing Rock. Cindy said: I'm here for my daughter. We fish in that water, we swim in it, we live in it. They don't know when that pipeline will leak or burst, and it will leak, affecting all of us downriver. This is the greatest rising of Natives in years. Trump signed an executive order to continue DAPL and the Keystone XL. Water is life. Mni Wiconi. It's time we have our voice. Native lives matter. The tipi was disassembled and the march continued to Lafayette Square, across from the White House. Thousands poured into the area to drum, sing and hear speakers. But a different set of politics came from the rally stage. Not a single water protector from Standing Rock was part of the scheduled lineup of speakers. Instead, the stage was dominated by celebrities, leaders of non-governmental organizations and politicians, including Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II, who has been sharply criticized by some water protectors for agreeing to the dismantling of the camps. A particularly low blow to Indigenous Hawaiians marching in D.C. was the inclusion on the stage of Hawaiian Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. Gabbard actively repressed the fight against the Thirty Meter Telescope project on the island of Hawaii. Gabbard, an opportunistic self-promoter, used her military veteran status to grab the spotlight during the self-deployment of 3,000 vets to Standing Rock in December 2016. The rally and other events of Native Nations Rising were organized by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Indigenous Environmental Network and the Native Organizers Alliance. It was an important symbol of the ongoing struggle for justice that came into the spotlight because of Standing Rock. While Archambault's and the tribal council's strategy of confining the fight against DAPL to the courts has been rightly criticized, it was important to revive the spirit of solidarity so evident at Standing Rock--and bring it to Trump's doorstep. But it was deeply disappointing to those who have been devoted themselves to the struggle for this past year to have the voices of water protectors themselves missing at the rally. After the official speakers had finished, a small group of water protectors forced their way onto the stage and, bullhorn in hand, challenged what was taking place. During a peaceful prayer action at Backwater Bridge on January 19, the night before Trump's inauguration, Marcus was hit in the face with a bean-bag round fired by Morton County Police, which left him partially blind and damaged his sense of smell, taste and hearing. Marcus was later discovered by fellow water protectors at a hospital in Bismarck, North Dakota, handcuffed to a bed with an armed guard at his side. He had been denied water and any means of communicating with his family. Immediately following his release from the hospital, Morton County put out a warrant for his arrest. The fact that this story--one among many similar ones--was deemed by organizers to be unimportant or perhaps too divisive to be heard by the thousands who marched in D.C., is an insult to those called by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe to protect the water. There is a burning irony in the fact that Native Nations Rise promoted the march and rally with an iconic photo of water protector Helen Red Feather, right fist in the air--yet excluded the voices of water protectors from the stage. In a video released shortly before she was evicted from the Oceti Sakowin camp, Red Feather was critical of the tribal government's use of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). A NUMBER of water protectors, members of The Red Nation (TRN) and International Socialist Organization (ISO) members gathered on the evening of March 10 to discuss these issues and how to organize the fight going forward. Denetchiley talked the impacts of environmental and personal racism on her nation. In the Four Corners area of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona, the number of suicides rose in the 18 months following the August 2015 Gold King Mine waste water spill. In the spill, some 3 million gallons of wastewater--contaminated with heavy metals, including cadmium and lead and poisons like arsenic--blew out of the mine during an Environmental Protection Agency-monitored cleanup activity. The poison slime flowed into Cement Creek, and then into the Animas River in Colorado, a part of the San Juan River watershed, turning the water a sickly orange. It took the EPA more than a day to warn the Navajo nation of the pollution of the waters used for drinking and irrigating crops. Heavy metal toxicity can cause a number of fatal outcomes, and is often linked to birth defects. Yet such environmental racism is just one injustice directed at Natives. Others are much more direct. However, Denetchiley noted that more and more Natives are organizing and working against the priorities of profit-grabbing extractive enterprises. It means opening up the land; stopping privatization of native lands. THE NATIVE Nations Rise events in Washington helped energized the movement for Native rights and against poisonous pipelines, but it also highlighted a number of discussions about how to best organize these struggles that need to continue in the months to come as we continue to mobilize and protest. On the one hand, there is the strategy of depending on elected politicians and on federal laws to take care of the problems for us. But this leaves untouched the earth-killing drive for profits that is at the heart of capitalism. On the other hand, there are the politics of self-organization and solidarity. These politics challenge the belief that the earth and the people who live on it can continue to live with capitalism. While there are many fights ahead, and the push to complete DAPL is a setback to the struggle, the meeting pointed to the need for continued united action to beat back the pipelines and fight for Native liberation.

Odd. That means MoCs are enormously sensitive to their local image, and they will work very hard to avoid signs of public disapproval from constituents. Some MoCs have clearly made the calculation that they can lay low, avoid their constituents, and hope the current storm blows over. This toolkit describes how local groups can make missing MoCs more accessible. MoCs are gambling that out of sight means out of mind. It will take some work, but their constituents have power win at this game. This works--and this brief describes the nuts and bolts of getting it done. Town halls are a basic part of our democratic heritage and every Member of Congress should have them. Town halls are a time-honored tradition for listening to constituents. In addition to allowing constituents to communicate their views directly to a MoC, rather than through staff, it gives MoCs the chance to take the temperature of their constituents and discuss their positions in greater detail. Now, some MoCs find the prospect of a town hall, or even a large group meeting, pretty scary. If they handle a controversial policy question or a heartfelt personal story poorly, a whole lot of people are going to hear about it. As a constituent, you deserve opportunities to share your views and personal stories about how policy affects your lives with your representative. And you also deserve opportunities to hear directly from your MoC about where they stand on the issues you care about. Check if your MoC has a calendar of events on their website. Some MoCs will use their own channels or other mailing lists to advertise public events so that only their supporters will know about them. Other good mailing lists. Check out open-source listings. Connect with local media. To do this, research on Google News what local reporters have written about your MoCs. Find and follow those reporters on Twitter, and build relationships. Before you attend or plan a town hall, reach out and explain why your group is going, and provide them with background materials and a quote, including how many members your group has and how many times you have called your members to ask for a town hall or public event. Reach out to organizations with civic missions and ask them to weigh in or invite MoCs to community forums or events. MoCs might be willing to dodge your Indivisible group but hesitate to alienate a local civic association, PTA, or church group. Collect data. Try to find out when your MoC last held a public event. So, your next step is to draw attention to the fact that your MoC has gone into hiding. If the drumbeat gets loud enough, they may back down. Here are some ways you can creatively press for them to come around: Gather RSVPs. Demonstrate the demand for a town hall by collecting a list of interested constituents who want to come. You can do this via Facebook, or whatever platform is easiest for you. Get the attention of the press. Call or write local political reporters and explain the situation to them. Be concise, clear, and as specific as possible. Draft and distribute a statement about the lack of opportunities for constituents to engage with your MoC. Take it to Twitter and Facebook: post about your experiences trying to get a public meeting with your MoC. Tag local reporters for additional visibility. Find prominent people to amplify your message. If you know any local celebrities or prominent people, ask them to help spread the word. Do some research to find out what else they might be doing. If your MoC is attending a fundraiser (you can check here for a partial list), meeting with lobbyists, or being interviewed by friendly press, this can reflect poorly on them. Asking whatever it is your MoC is doing with their time instead of meeting with the constituents they represent. Finding out what public meetings other MoCs are having, and highlighting that as a point of comparison. This requires some additional preparation, but it can be extremely effective in drawing attention to your missing MoC. Explore holding your event at a local school, library, or conference or convention center where a space can be obtained for low cost. Find out if basics like chairs and audio equipment are already available at the venue. Invite your MoC. There are a couple of ways to invite your MoC to an event: Official invite to the office. You can also hand deliver an invitation to a district office. To drum up extra excitement about the event, document the process and post about it on social media with photos and video. Begrudgingly accept staffers instead. Your MoC very well may not come, and they might even hide from you entirely. Publicize widely that your MoCs are keynote speakers who have been invited. Think about the visuals and get creative. For instance, be prepared with a cardboard cutout or an empty chair. This is a classic political campaign tactic for when your opponent refuses to debate. It also works well for highlighting an absentee MoC. Plan a segment of the event where participants highlighting the fact that your MoC is acting cowardly and hiding from constituents. Plan for other speakers. Ask for attendees to plan to come prepared to speak out on specific policies that they care about, or that have personally affected them. In addition to individuals from your own group, these speakers could include: Advocacy and community groups that work on behalf of those threatened by the Trump administration (e.g., your local immigrant rights group), and ask them to come speak. Other local public officials who are happy to speak to their constituents. This is a great way to start a discussion with your own local leaders about ways local action can be part of pushing back against the Trump agenda. Publicize the event. Get in touch with press ahead of time. Issue a media advisory and send it to local reporters. Old-fashioned advertisement work. Put up flyers at coffee shops, bus stops, community centers, etc. Write an op-ed for your local newspaper making clear why your group is holding this event. Social media works too. Spread the word on Facebook and start inviting your friends, allies, and other constituents. Tell people on Twitter, and come up with a hashtag for your event. Post the information on your neighborhood listservs. Get ready to cover the town hall live. Assign people in your group to livestream the event via Facebook Live or Periscope and to live-tweet. Remember: the more attention, the more pressure on your MoC; and the more pressure, the more impact. Always remember: be polite, be respectful, and be persistent. In all your actions, you will do best if you model the respect and thoughtfulness that you want to see from your MoCs. For more information, contact Jane Doe at 222-222-2222. We will win. The tactics for making your voice heard at these events are similar but a bit different from the public town hall events: Optimize visibility. Unlike in town halls, you want your presence as a group to be recognizable and attention-getting at this event. Be prepared to interrupt and insist on your right to be heard. Agree beforehand with your group on a simple message focused on a current or upcoming issue. Coordinate with each other to chant this message outside, or during any public remarks that your MoC makes. This can be difficult and a bit uncomfortable. Identify, and try to speak with, reporters on the scene. Be polite and friendly, and stick to your message. You may want to research in advance which local reporters cover MoCs or relevant beats (e.g., politics), so that you know who to look for. Emphasize that all of you are constituents. Give your hometowns and emphasize your roots in the community. Hold organizational hosts accountable. Reach out to them directly to express your concern that they are giving a platform to pro-Trump authoritarianism, sexism, racism, and corruption. If they persist, use social media to express your disappointment. This will reduce the likelihood that these organizations will host the Trump-friendly MoC in the future.

Now women are at the frontlines of the fight to save the rainforest. Their scattered villages along the banks of the Xingu River are so remote that until the 1950s, the Kayapo people had virtually no contact with or knowledge of the outside world. Over the past three decades, Kayapo communities have been increasingly exposed to the outside world, bringing major shifts in the tribe's social structure. One of the more recent and unexpected changes has been the emergence of three women chiefs, who are now in charge of villages spread across a vast swath of Amazonian rainforest. Tuire is the chief of Kapran-krere village. Last month, photographer Pinar Yolacan visited her there. When my uncle died and there was nobody to take his place, I decided to fight for his place. Traditionally, the roles of Kayapo have been divided strictly by gender and age. Watch: Inside China's Last Matriarchy Chiefs such as Tuire at the forefront of protests against illegal logging and mining, and have proved themselves to be valuable leaders and passionate, brave spokespeople. Just a month ago, the New York Times published a troubling report on the increasing violence against indigenous tribes in the Amazon, following a machete attack on a village by a group of ranchers who wounded 22 people in the northeastern region. There are now three female chiefs in total, including Ngreikamoro in the village of Aukre. Bephnhoti is clearly impressed by her. Deforestation in Mato Grosso, northwestern Brazil. The FP's role is to support communication between the village chiefs and with the outside world, assist with administration, and aid sustainable development and financing for the villages so that they are better equipped to defend themselves. Territorial monitoring and control is another of their principal concerns, Bephnhoti said. In striking similarities with the Sioux Standing Rock Reservation in the US, the government is under pressure from large corporations and landowners who want a lucrative slice of the Amazon. In mid-January this year, the government passed a federal decree that shifted the power to make decisions on indigenous land demarcation from FUNAI to the Ministry of Jutice. This means that decisions about indigenous land will now be made by Congress. Just as Trump has pushed the Dakota Access Pipeline through, the Kayapo could see their lands rights quashed by the government. I am only a woman, a fighter, a warrior, but they need to respect me. This is my nature, this is my land. The decree follows PEC 215, a proposed constitutional amendment that means that only land occupied by indigenous people since 1988 would be considered as reserves. Any land they had been evicted from prior to that date would not be eligible for consideration. According to Barbara Zimmerman, an ecologist and Kayapo program director at the International Conservation Fund of Canada, the latest legislation is a disaster for all indigenous groups and the environment they safeguard. Tuire became chief of her village after the death of her uncle. Last year, deforestation in the Amazon increased by 29 percent. They aren't protecting it in the same way we western environmentalists think of protecting nature, like any of us protect our homes. One of the Kayapo's most publicized protests was at the Brazilian port city of Altamira in 1989, against a mega-dam project on the Xingu River. The international publicity that followed forced the World Bank to abandon their funding for the project. Protest and global media attention might be the most potent tools at the Kayapo's disposal, but as the Standing Rock case proved, it's not enough. Organizing travel for tribe members from Para to the federal capital of Brasilia is also very expensive, and with their limited funding, indigenous protests are becoming smaller and less frequent. During the dam project, Tuire confronted the then leader of FUNAI (National Indian Foundation) very directly. I am only a woman, a fighter, a warrior, but they need to respect me.

This post is a work in progress, I will continue to add to it as learn more about the interests involved. Environmental activists have been on the offensive against pipelines and fracking developments, and the industry views it as a war. To regain public relations ground, companies formed coalitions, establishing news sites, social media accounts, as well undertaking more traditional lobbying efforts.

North Dakota Pipeline News claims to take no position, merely to present the facts. Port is also editor of the SayAnything blog, a political news site busy with criticism of the pipeline protest, and is a columnist for Forum News Service, whose parent Forum Communications owns a network of conservative print and online publications throughout the US, several in the Midwest which are steeped in pro-pipeline coverage. A ProDAPL Facebook page is also managed by Port. The Fact Checker is a project of the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now, which according to its website is a partnership of entities from the agriculture, business, and labor sectors aimed at supporting the economic development and energy security benefits associated with infrastructure projects in the Midwest. Journals that have sprung up to cover the Bakken lode include Bakken Oil Business Journal, Bakken Magazine, and the Bakken Oil Report. No matter how essential the DAPL may be for fuel supply, which is questionable, there is no denying that police response to protests has often been brutal, as Amnesty and the UN have both observed.

A great mountain of a man with thick black hair to his waist and a disarming gentleness, Rattler made the objects around him look small. The sofa on which he sat, the phone he held, the homey living room where we met, the whole city of Bismarck seemed too small for Rattler. But his bail conditions and an ankle monitor confined him to the area for over half a year as he awaits trial. He put the phone down. She ventured that the line he was seeking might be from the Declaration of Independence. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Rattler, 45, legal name Michael Markus, is one of six native activists facing near-unprecedented federal charges related to the Standing Rock protest camps against the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The authorities razed the last major holdouts of the camps on February 23, by which point numbers had already dwindled as blizzard conditions pummeled the prairie lands. The camera crews packed up and most of the country went back to focusing on Trump. But for Rattler, his federal co-defendants, the many hundreds of arrestees facing state charges, and their lawyers, the fight on the ground in North Dakota is far from over. They face a terrain as brutal and unforgiving as any winter on the Standing Rock reservation: a small-town court system in conservative rural counties with no experience of anything nearing this scale or political valence. Rattler Jonathan Klett, Liminal Films The fate of the DAPL standoff does not only reside in judicial decisions about the flow of oil. Those who stood on the frontlines for clean water, for indigenous struggle, for their ancestors and for our future, are being brought to alleged justice in an area where the very possibility of an impartial jury is in serious doubt. North Dakota prosecutor Ladd Erickson told me over the phone that prior to the Standing Rock cases, the only mass arrest incidents that these local counties had dealt with involved breaking up graduation parties of drunk high-schoolers. And while thousands flocked to the protest camps, only a few dozen lawyers and supporters remain and return to continue the arduous and overwhelming task of defending these cases in an area where towns consist of interconnected parking lots, strip mall restaurants and boxy houses, surrounded by unending sightlines of rolling grassland. She is one among a small cadre of lawyers and legal support workers who have put their normal lives on hold in order to seek justice for water protectors facing trial in the conservative, rural midwest. There has already been one spill, albeit small. A major spill would contaminate the main water source of the Standing Rock Sioux and 17 million people who live downstream. The decision is a partial victory for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, but too little too late and oil is still flowing through the DAPL. Since February, anti-pipeline activists have taken their fight from North Dakota to new camps across the U.S., against pipeline construction and fracking operations in Nebraska, Iowa, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. On it were the lines of the Fort Laramie treaties, which drew up the Great Sioux Reservation in 1851 and 1868. His great-great-great-great grandfather was Chief Red Cloud, the storied Oglala Lakota leader who oversaw successful campaigns against the U.S. Army in 1866 and signed the 1868 Fort Laramie treaty, delineating the Indian Country through which the DAPL now runs. Red Cloud died at Pine Ridge in 1909. The same Pine Ridge where over 250 Lakota were massacred and buried in a mass grave in 1890 at Wounded Knee; the same Wounded Knee where, in 1973, American Indian Movement (AIM) activists and supporters from every Indian nation occupied the town. Unlike the Standing Rock standoff, the Wounded Knee occupation was armed. But like the water protectors four decades later, the AIM resistance at Wounded Knee faced militarized, multi-agency law enforcement repression, followed by protracted court battles aimed at defanging and punishing the movement. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Native American protesters and their supporters are confronted by security during a demonstration against work being done for the Dakota Access Pipeline oil pipeline on September 3, 2016. The other, the Freshet Collective, works largely on arrestee support, such paying nearly a half a million dollars in cash bail, coordinating criminal defense, travel, accommodation, and logistics for the out-of-state lawyers and hundreds of defendants who live nowhere near the site of their court dates. Freeman moved to North Dakota, leaving her family and her regular legal practice in Denver for months at a time. The Standing Rock federal trials are not likely to begin until October, at the earliest. Police deployed armored vehicles, lashes of pepper spray and LRAD sound cannons to clear water protectors from one of the campsites, while barricades were set alight and DAPL equipment was damaged. AIM members from the Wounded Knee occupation faced the very same charge. Protesters build a tipi at Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on December 2, 2016 outside Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Each defendant now faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted. Meanwhile the state cases are already trickling through Morton County, with hundreds still unresolved. The pipeline fight provided a visual language of indigenous resistance and frontline militarized battle: the bright flags of every tribal nation flying, the temporary tent and tipi towns, hundreds of bold banners, water protectors in traditional dress on horses, law enforcement officers and National Guardsmen in riot gear. Tear gas. Water cannons. Fire. Just over 70,000 people live in Bismarck, where the federal court is small enough to share a building with the post office, the granite stone entrance of which became a regular backdrop for protests. If you squint, it could almost be quaint; a late 19th-century railroad town with morning-trimmed store fronts and saloons. But to look at it clearly is to see cheap, beige concrete facades and dilapidated motels, sports bars and chain restaurants. Here, the lawyers and legal support workers live and work out of a former hotel-turned-flophouse, with a makeshift office on the ground floor. A Christmas wreath hangs on the wall in mid-Spring. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below The curtains are drawn over the office windows and there are no signs on the door. They work in one large room with mismatched felt sofas and plastic chairs, a shit-brown carpet, a defunct popcorn machine, and a poster of Leonard Peltier pinned to the wall. According to Freeman and her colleagues, the first two buildings in which they tried to rent turned them down after hearing that they were in town to defend water protectors. Rattler told me in the previous weeks, on two occasions, two different unmarked cars pulled up beside him on the street and a passenger brandished a Glock 10 before the vehicles sped away. I came to North Dakota three months after the February eviction. There was all but no sign of the once sprawling camps that had stood 40 miles south of Bismarck. Riot police had used the wire to surround and block off a sacred burial site named Turtle Island after water protectors crossed near-freezing water to pray there in November. I traveled to the site with Freeman and some of her co-workers. An ebullient paralegal named Jess in gold eye-shadow and a floral skirt pointed out where the various camp areas had stood. Nor had Dandilion Cloverdale, a sex worker and educator from Montana who now works for the Freshet Collective in North Dakota to coordinate travel and lodging for defendants. Cloverdale walked around solemnly, eyes streaming from the winds blowing sideways on the plains. Cloverdale had been the camp manager for the small Two Spirit Nation camp at Standing Rock, which brought together the intersection of the indigenous and LBGTQ struggle and many Two Spirit youth. Native teens and young adults are 1.5 times as likely to kill themselves as the national average. Water protectors and land defenders see themselves in a struggle to affirm and sustain life, which is as much spiritual as it is material and environmental. Native American and other activists celebrate after learning an easement had been denied for the Dakota Access Pipeline at Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on December 4, 2016. Files and paperwork take up every table surface, with extension cords and wires from four to five laptops at a time snaking around the sparse furniture. Outside of their temporary lodgings, the Freshet and WPLC workers stand out in white Trump country; their ranks include Native Americans, gender nonconforming and queer individuals, trendy New Yorkers and what your grandparents might call hippies. Freeman concurred. But only about ten local defense council are working directly with the WPLC. North Dakota as a whole has an entrenched conservative bent with Republicans in firm control of the state house and executive. Local landowners and residents in the surrounding rural areas described the camps as a source of disruption, crime and vandalism. Protesters stand their ground on the bridge between Oceti Sakowin Camp and County Road 134 in North Dakota on Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016 while being sprayed with water cannons. Getty Images On top of a uniquely brutal winter, these were unwelcome interruptions, which provoked ire against protesters, but not the pipeline that drew them to North Dakota. I met Hintz, a friendly, athletic 46-year-old with a shaved head and bright blue eyes, in his well-lit shop just a short walk from the federal court-cum-post office. Local fear and antipathy was further stoked through the concerted efforts of law enforcement officers, county authorities and mercenary security contractors (hired by DAPL owner Energy Transfer Partners) who spent months painting the water protectors as criminals and security threats. Getty Images It worked. One hundred percent of respondents admitted prior knowledge of the issues involved in the cases. Motions have been filed by attorneys in both state and federal court for a change of venue, to move the cases out of rural areas directly affected by the camps; at the time of writing, none have been granted and concerns about the very possibility of fair trials runs high. For Freeman, the jury survey is a reflection of the sort of hostility she and clients and colleagues have felt in the area. US veterans and native americans hold hands in prayer and solidarity on the road near Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on December 4, 2016. A striking admission from a prosecutor about the risk of local bias. If an individual defendant did want to raise the fact that 99 percent of the arrests took place on land accorded to the Lakota tribe in either the 1851 or 1858 Fort Laramie treaties, the point would have little legal traction. If they had been historically respected, they would be no DAPL in the first place. The grim irony that many of the arrests led to trespass charges for natives on what should be their land is one that animates the history of this country. Snow covers Oceti Sakowin Camp near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on November 30, 2016. But according to the lawyers I spoke to, including Bruce Ellison, a veteran attorney who represented AIM leaders after the 1973 standoff and continues to represent Leonard Peltier as well as a number of Standing Rock defendants, many of the cases are eminently defensible on points of law and proof, regardless of a treaty defense. The challenge is to defend what they believe to be defensible in this tough rural context with only a small legal operation handling hundreds of cases. After a group dinner in her living room one night, Freeman and I sat in her equally jumbled adjoining bedroom. In early July, Freshet published a tally of case statistics. Six hundred and four state cases were unresolved (517 open cases, 85 warrants issued and two cases going through appeal), with charges ranging from minor disorderly conduct violations to felony arson and assault on an officer. There had been eight convictions and three not-guilty rulings; the courts will take well over a year to get through the caseload. But by early August, prosecutors, lacking witnesses, evidence, and appropriate paperwork by arresting officers, began to dismiss cases by the dozen, often at the eleventh hour as court dates approach, but hundreds remain. Accounting for every arrestee and finding each defendant appropriate representation has been a mammoth task in and of itself, and one that is not yet complete. And for the prosecutors, mass arrest days, which involved law enforcement officers from around the country and state, are proving a challenge. At the time of writing, over 168 charges have been outright dismissed by prosecutors before even attempting to extract pleas or go to trial, evidencing the illegitimacy of these charges in the first place. US Navy deep sea diving veteran Rob McHaney holds an American flag as he leads a group of veteran activists back from a police barricade on a bridge near Oceti Sakowin Camp on December 4, 2016. Getty Images The fact that numerous cases have already been dismissed, and juries have delivered not-guilty verdicts in three cases already, including those of Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault and Tribal Councilman Dana Yellow Fat gives hope to the defense attorneys. Meltzer-Cohen scoffed at the editorial. The lawyer does not see the recent wave of dismissals as an outright victory, but evidence of vast police misconduct and original prosecutorial overreach. And for hundreds of arrestees, particularly the federal defendants, a reprieve is not on the near horizon. Freeman believes that in the many cases that remain, only 10 percent of defendants will seek to settle out of court, but that the majority of water protectors will want to fight their cases. White Wolf was born and raised in Louisiana and comes from the Houma tribe. For the next generation. But for the Lakota, the black snake is not just one pipeline. It harkens back to a prophecy in which a great black snake would come to the Lakota lands and devastate the earth. He carefully felt along the mass. A six-foot long poisonous diamondback had wedged itself head down along the side of his sleeping bag. In one move, Rattler grabbed his service knife, grabbed the snake, and cut off its head. His lieutenant, emerging from a tent, watched on. He retells the story with gusto, a grin and dramatic hand gestures. The name Rattler stuck, now an appropriate nom-de-guerre for a man who came to North Dakota to fight the black snake, and whose liberty is under threat because of it. Back in South Dakota, Rattler worked as a truck driver and a handyman, preferring to barter his trades and skills for items he needed to live, rather than money. He had first come to Standing Rock to deliver donated supplies from Pine Ridge in Betty Boop (his truck, for which he uses bio-fuel whenever possible). He made three return trips until one event in September prompted him to stay for good. In early September, protesters claimed that private DAPL security guards released attack dogs and sprayed mace on protesters. Freeman nodded as she listened to him, a hand on his shoulder. During his months stuck in Bismarck, the water protector has been waiting and praying. Most days, he stays inside, reads, writes and sketches. Rattler re-reads letters of support and solidarity he received from supporters around the country while he was in jail. When we returned to her apartment above the office that night, Freeman briefly burst into tears, wiped her eyes, and got back to work.

I want to say I got involved in resisting the Sabal Trail Pipeline (STP) back in October of last year. Firster, handed me a flyer about a weekend workshop they were organizing to resist a local pipeline in FL, the STP. Once I went to the workshop I was hooked. I got rid of a lot of my belongings, sold my van, put what I was keeping in storage and by Christmas Day, I had joined Sacred Water Camp. From that point on I lived at the various camps for about 3 months. For me the campaign seemed to start when that first workshop happened. Folks from all over the country came to the workshop, even folks who had been at Standing Rock, it was really successful. It really evolved when Sacred Water Camp became a solid encampment. This gave folks who were traveling some distance a place to stay, do some action, and move on. I see this type of fluidity as very valuable to a movement. Hundreds of people came from all over the country and many of them had been at Standing Rock. Elders and youth were getting involved, protesting, organizing, donating supplies. There have been police stationed at each site where STP crosses under rivers. The State has sent their dogs out in mass during our protests, one in which we had about 300 protesters show up and about 80 police lined the fences, protecting the drill going underneath the Suwannee River. There have been about 30 arrests so far, the most recent was 3 at a protest on June 10th. Other actions have included folks standing directly in front of the trucks that carries water to the drills, multiple lock downs to these trucks, and people locking down inside the pipeline with a 200 pound cement block. The resistance has been strong, but I always feel it can be stronger. There are many ways to support those who put their lives on the line to save the Earth and its inhabitants. A main way is throwing some money their way. Often times folks want to cheer on activists while they are organizing, protesting, and doing direct action, but then folks tend to leave others in the dust during times their support is truly needed. In this case, taking a plea deal with restitution seemed better than being felons for the rest of our lives. Even though the gas has been turned on there are still protests happening, in addition to a memorial service for James Marker, a man who shot up the pipeline with a high powered rifle and was chased and then killed by police. At this point the folks who really need support are the ones who have thrown down and now have to deal with probation and court costs. Some things to keep in mind going forward is that it takes a large amount of bodies in order to get any sort of attention and to make headway, especially folks willing to do direct action. Also there needs to be consistent communication, especially about the various tactics folks wish to use.

This is Kim's account of her time at Standing Rock. We arrived around 9 p.m. at night. Before we got there I did a lot of research and reading on what was going on. And some of it, I have to be honest, I didn't believe. I had seen one photo online that showed bright lights shining from the top of a hill across the river and directed at the camp. I thought that image looked photoshopped and didn't believe those lights were there. But they are. Lights near where the Dakota Access Pipeline is being built shine over the camps at Standing Rock, North Dakota. It is on and across from reserve land. It is rural and wild. At night when the sun goes down it should be pitch black with a million stars overhead. And those lights are where the pipeline is being built.

Sullivan, a 35-year-old navy veteran from San Diego, who returned home from Standing Rock on Monday, had not heard he was a suspect until a Guardian reporter called him on Thursday afternoon. The arson accusation, which police said could lead to prosecution, is the latest in a series of arrests and charges filed against veterans aiding indigenous groups fighting the pipeline, which could soon be in operation. Last month, police filed charges against two veterans supporting Standing Rock, holding one in jail for several days. The prosecutions raised concerns that police were trying to prevent them from going to the camps. The Guardian interviewed Sullivan last week on the day a highly militarized police operation began raiding the camps and making arrests. Throughout the day, some activists were setting fire to remaining structures at Oceti Sakowin, the main Standing Rock camp that is now completely evacuated. Sullivan told the Guardian at the time that he witnessed an explosion in a tipi and helped two people to safety. On Thursday, he said the photo that police took from his Facebook shows him near a different burning structure. He said he was on the other end of camp when people first lit it on fire and that he briefly came over later and took a photo of it. Sean Sullivan says the photo on his Facebook page was taken near a burning structure, but he had nothing to do with the fire. Photograph: Facebook Sullivan said many journalists saw him take a photo and that the image he put on Facebook is from Vice News. The veterans charged last month were accused of drug offenses after they were searched and found to have small amounts of cannabis, which they said they were prescribed to treat post-traumatic stress disorder. Some Native American activists are already facing serious arson charges and potentially hefty prison sentences. Many similar charges, however, were also dropped or rejected by a judge last year due to lack of evidence. Keller said he suspects Sullivan could face charges, but did not provide further details. Crane said he suspected Sullivan became a target since he was a visible member of VeteransRespond who had talked to multiple reporters. Mark Sanderson, executive director of VeteransRespond, said he was shocked by the news.

Tom Berry, of Dandelion Spring Farm in Newcastle, and Annie Bayer, of Buckwheat Blossom Farm in Wiscasset, had a 2,000-mile road trip they needed to get started on. By late afternoon, they had received word that the roads were beginning to clear and they started their trek south in a 10-foot insulated box truck filled with winter provisions that were destined for the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota. While the Army Corps of Engineers said Dec. 4 that it would not permit the advancement of the pipeline, some protesters remain in camps on the reservation. Having recently retired the 10-foot insulated truck from their fleet, Schiller said the decision to donate it to the Standing Rock community was easy. However, Schiller said she was truly surprised by the outpouring of support from fellow community members, farmers and otherwise, in their willingness to help them collect items to donate. Money was also raised to fund gas costs for the trip, with any extra money being donated to the Standing Rock community. However, Schiller said the ethics behind the donation and solidarity with a community 2,000 miles away extended beyond the issue of the pipeline. Beyond the ethical motivation to continue with the donation, contact that those involved in organizing the donation had with people at Standing Rock indicated that a need was still there. One of the people Schiller had been in contact with was Lauren Pignatello, an herbalist from Whitefield who recently returned to Maine after spending three weeks at Standing Rock treating the injured with homeopathic healing techniques."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/259988164t?referring_akid=.2363176.RPAnIy", "Timestamp": "20180919005438", "Sentences": "You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities.

This means that in order to ensure that global warming does not rise to 2C above pre-industrial levels, the target agreed to in the COP21 Paris Agreement which went into effect on November 4, 2016, these reserves cannot be extracted. However much oil ends up being taken out of the ground, much of it will go through pipelines. A corollary of stranded assets is that, in addition to oil reserves, some amount of pipeline capacity will become stranded assets as well. And just as oil and gas companies continue to drill, pipeline companies continue to build. This pipeline goes through the drinking water, sacred sites, and traditional lands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe (SRST), leading to an increasingly contentious conflict. ETP contends that it obtained all necessary permits and licenses from the federal government to build DAPL. Starting earlier this year, the SRST staged a protest to block construction of DAPL. The protest has grown to an encampment of 7,000 people, many of whom vow to hold out through the brutal North Dakota winter. The SRST is also taking ETP to court and as of November 2, the Army Corps was considering options for alternate routes. In the meantime, protesters are being arrested, attacked by dogs, pepper sprayed, and shot with rubber bullets. ETP has a terrible water track record, with pending contamination lawsuits in four states. One would think that by now pipeline companies have learned the lesson that their social license to operate is critical, and would seek to constructively work with communities to get that license. In Canada, the Northern Gateway Pipeline has been mired in delays caused by litigation with First Nations along its route. People gather to join the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's protest against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipe. I think there are two underlying forces that will make such conflicts more numerous and more brutal despite the economic evidence of their costs. The first is dramatic differences in time frames. This land has belonged to the tribe for generations and they feel a deep economic, cultural, and spiritual responsibility to the environmental consequences of pipelines. On the other hand ETP, and the banks supporting it, have a very short time frame. The stakes are high for DAPL. The sooner the pipeline is built and oil starts flowing, the sooner ETP starts making money and the banks start getting paid back. ETP is feeling intense pressure from both its oil company customers and its banks. The second powerful force is the ironic one of stranded assets. The rational response from these companies facing short-term market pressures is to get as much of these assets out of the ground as quickly as possible. This desire to pump is magnified if boards of directors are putting pressures on their CEOs (who have limited tenure in their jobs) because they believe the long-term prices of these assets will only decline. These pressures then translate to the pipeline companies who help bring these assets to market. Here they confront the legitimate rights of Indigenous Peoples over whose lands these pipelines must traverse. We are looking at a combustible mix of stranded assets due to environmental issues, closing windows of opportunity to get these assets out of the ground, and the rights of Indigenous Peoples and other communities to provide FPIC. Within this conflict is a potential solution. Just as capital markets are increasingly addressing environmental issues raised by oil and gas (such as pricing down these assets, pressuring companies to more accurately represent the value of these assets on their balance sheets, and demanding greater transparency on strategies for transitioning to a 2C world), they must do the same for social issues. Investors have enormous leverage to ensure FPIC before committing money and have an obvious self-interest in doing so, as the frequency and scale of conflicts between companies and communities continues to rise.

Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. The War and Peace Report. Well, in recent months, the repression against the water protectors and journalists covering the movement has continued to intensify. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple has also activated the National Guard. Water protectors also report near-constant surveillance from police planes and helicopters. Over 400 people have been arrested so far, and many report being subjected to strip searches while in the Morton County jail in North Dakota. Well, on October 31st, we spoke with Dakota and Dine Nation activist Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network about a violent police raid on a frontline camp established at the site of the same sacred tribal burial ground where unlicensed Dakota Access security guards attacked Native Americans with dogs and pepper spray on September 3rd. Dallas Goldtooth began by telling us about shocking video footage that emerged from the day of the raid of a man who worked with the Dakota Access pipeline. He was a pipeline guard. But he was wearing a bandana covering his face, carrying a rifle, apparently attempting to infiltrate a group of water protectors. DALLAS GOLDTOOTH: Thanks for having me on, Amy. And it was a very terrifying moment for a lot of us watching, I mean, to see this man pointing an assault rifle at our water protectors. You know, your description is accurate. And they did their very best to incapacitate the vehicle and did their very best to de-escalate the situation, which they were successful in doing. And so, it was pretty straightforward. And it just clearly paints that Dakota Access has no regard for common decency or any kind of corporate responsibility. DALLAS GOLDTOOTH: From what I understand, the initial response from Dakota Access is that they state that this individual does not work for Dakota Access, even though he had clear identification as a Dakota Access worker. It says Kyle Thompson. DALLAS GOLDTOOTH: Yes, yes. His name is on it. You know, he has an ID card with DAPL written on it. AMY GOODMAN: Right. DALLAS GOLDTOOTH: No, this happened last night. It was just to the immediate west of the Oceti Sakowin camp across Highway 1806. And immediately after that, flames were seen on top of the hill to the west. I mean, it was very, very clear that that brush fire that happened was an act of arson by unknown individuals. And thank God that the wind was pushing away from the camp. The fire spread pretty large. They asked. Morton County never gave them the permission to fight that fire. They just let it burn. And that collusion is causing a very, very dangerous situation for our water protectors and for the main camp, that houses women, children, elders and just people that care and love for the land and are there for one sole purpose: to protect the water. AMY GOODMAN: Dallas, we got word that a horse had to be put down after being shot with rubber bullets by police. DALLAS GOLDTOOTH: This is true. And we were being pushed back, and batons are being swung, cracking over the heads and arms of our water protectors. And then we looked to the east, and over the hills to the east comes a herd of a couple hundred buffalo, bison, roaming, like stampeding towards the police line. And immediately behind them came some horseback riders, some young riders, men and women, who were actually guiding these buffalo towards the police line in an act of resistance and defiance. They were like flying like 30 feet off the ground to scare the buffalo off. And then they deployed ATVs to attack the horseback riders. They were shot with rubber bullets. One of the horseback riders was pulled off their horse. And sadly, one horse was injured so badly by the police that it had to be put down. Like, the pipeline is literally within miles of the Missouri River. But we need to do everything in our power to keep it from getting to that place. We enacted a form of eminent domain, claiming the land back for ourselves as Oceti Sakowin folks. And we set up a beautiful encampment on that piece of property, which severely threatened Dakota Access, and, obviously, Morton County sheriff, for their intents to build this pipeline. And so they came in with a large force. And you described, you know, a lot of the equipment that was there. And it was terrifying. I mean, we had elders, women and children who were put at severe risk because of the actions of law enforcement. A lot of folks know the Ponca leader Casey Camp. She stood in defiance, in peaceful prayer, in front of an armored personnel carrier, because she loved the land and wanted to protect the Missouri River, not just for the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, but for all nations and all people and the millions of people who depend on the Missouri River for drinking water. So this movement is not founded out of hate for the police officers or for the workers themselves, but out of love for the land and for all of us as human beings. Our enemy is not the police. He works with the Indigenous Environmental Network. Special thanks to Laura Gottesdiener, John Hamilton and Denis Moynihan.

Indigo Girls have played the festival and had a song on the tribute record. Now we know. We are simply saying that building this pipeline is the wrong thing to do, and its disregard for Native land, water, and rights is in direct conflict with our philosophy as artists and people who care about Indigenous peoples and the environment. We wrote to Mr. Warren, asking him to reconsider and stop the pipeline. Many of us who have played your festival have invested time and energy into the fight for human rights and environmental justice. For some of us, this mission is the moving force and spiritual foundation of our larger community of musicians, and one of the inspirations to play such rich gatherings as the Cherokee Music Festival. This pipeline violates the Standing Rock Sioux Nation's treaty rights, endangers the vital Missouri River, and continues the trajectory of genocide against Native Peoples. Many of us have also participated in projects affiliated with Music Road Records, another company of yours. While this company does a lot to promote incredible music that comes from the roots of our country, many of us, as artists, take offense and are mystified by how someone with such a deep passion for organic and traditional music can own a company that is so blatantly tearing at the heart of the fabric of our American community. The American tradition of music that is so diverse and rich depends on the respect for human rights and that includes environmental justice for Native Peoples that contribute to the great tapestry of this land. In order to stay true to our music and respect the Native Nations that are united against the Dakota Access Pipeline, we will no longer play your festival or participate in Music Road Records recordings. We stand with Standing Rock, the Standing Rock Sioux, their friends, and allies in protecting their sacred land and water by stopping the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline and all pipelines that threaten massive ecosystems.

By Camille Erickson The fight to protect Water Protectors who face state and federal charges from the Indigenous-led Dakota Access Pipeline resistance at Standing Rock is far from over. Beginning in 2016, the WPLC provided legal support on the front lines of the Dakota Access Pipeline resistance at Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota. Led by Executive Director Terry Janis (Oglala Lakota), the organization continues to provide accessible criminal defense and legal representation in state and federal court at no cost to Native and non-Native Water Protectors. Stretching over 1,170 miles across the Midwest, the pipeline cuts directly through sacred land and threatens to contaminate the drinking water for both the Standing Rock Sioux and over 17 million people along the Missouri River. Yet, Water Protectors faced violent responses from private security forces and arrest from law enforcement during their encampment. Mounting tensions came to a head on September 3, 2016, when security guards used dogs to attack Water Protectors, harming at least six people. Private security also pepper-sprayed 30 people. As a member of the WPLC legal team, Carter remains fiercely committed to Indigenous rights. She arrived at Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in October 2016 from California to provide legal support. She watched the camp rapidly grow as thousands of Water Protectors, galvanized by the movement, poured into North Dakota from across the globe. As the camp swelled with people, arrests of Water Protectors, coupled with police and security misconduct, only increased with charges, including trespassing, resisting arrest, and participating in a riot. In one month alone, Water Protectors were met with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber pellets, sound cannons, and arrest from law enforcement in its attempts to evacuate individuals occupying roads near the camp. On Oct. 27, 2016, during a confrontation, 147 Water Protectors were arrested and some slapped with felony charges of Civil Disorder and Use of Fire to Commit a Federal Felony Offense. The following month, Brandy Toelupe, an attorney with WPLC, described the conditions arrestees endured following their arrest that day. Former Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault also submitted a complaint to the Department of Justice. In the wake of these mass arrests, what started as an informal legal tent at the camp quickly grew into a tenacious organization defending hundreds of lives afflicted by persecution. Over the course of a year, the number of Water Protectors facing state charges ballooned to 835 people. An urgency developed to formalize the legal entity into a fiscally sponsored nonprofit organization. WPLC now leads the fight to protect each of the individuals who were charged. While the organization maintains on-the-ground operations in North Dakota, its support for these hundreds of legal cases reaches far beyond state lines. As of June 5, 2018, of the 835 state cases, 664 cases have been concluded, with a majority of them dismissed (333) and acquitted (24). 19 defendants have been convicted on the state level. To her, these victories set a precedent for future movements for Indigenous rights. On May 24, a charge against Water Protector Peji Hota Win (Saige Pourier) was dismissed in court. Two days prior, her two other charges were also dismissed. As an indigenous person we know this system is unjust, so to be able to walk away with this victory is a victory for us all. Challenges of caseload, geography, and bias WPLC sees accessible and free legal representation as a vital need to justice, and it remains resolute in protecting the most vulnerable. Still, in the case of Standing Rock charges, its ability to obtain effective representation for Water Protectors was outmatched by the state. As soon as attorneys began taking on cases in defense of Water Protectors in 2016, geography became a challenge. WPLC knew immediately that the quantity of cases far outstripped the supply of licensed attorneys in the state who could effectively represent the accused. In December 2016, WPLC filed a petition in the North Dakota Supreme Court to revise the pro hac vice statutes, thereby enabling out-of-state attorneys not licensed to practice in North Dakota to represent Water Protectors facing state criminal cases. Last September, judges asked the North Dakota Supreme Court to reverse the special provision that admitted out-of-state attorneys. The judges were denied this request. Despite the ruling in their favor, WPLC has continued their steep climb to obtain justice for Water Protectors in North Dakota. There have also been repeated legislative attempts to change laws that would increase penalties for mass mobilization efforts, such as protests and expressions of dissent. Trumped-up charges and penalties against Water Protectors also have ramifications on future movement building. The stakes are high. Since late 2016, the National Lawyers Guild reports that 58 anti-protest bills have been put forward in 31 U.S. states. In the North Dakota Legislature, a bill was introduced to eliminate any liability for drivers who harm protesters occupying public roads. The bill did not pass, but these efforts point to a systematic effort to further criminalize peaceful dissent and First Amendment rights. The justice system disproportionately targets Native lives. Implicit bias in the courtrooms of North Dakota runs deep, too. To Carter, the most significant challenge was the implicit bias she witnessed against Water Protectors in the criminal justice system, public opinion, and police force in North Dakota. Having witnessed Little Feather navigate the criminal justice system, she thinks the bias they experienced stems in part from the high number of North Dakota residents depending on extractive industries for their livelihood. Given these barriers, WPLC continues to recruit attorneys from across the country to defend Water Protectors. Water Protectors with federal charges face high risk These challenges extend to Water Protectors facing charges on the federal level. On May 30, Little Feather, a member of the Coastal Band of the Chumash Nation, was sentenced to 36 months in federal prison in a non-cooperating plea agreement. Incarcerated since March 9, 2017, he is the first Water Protector to have a federal case conclude with substantial prison time. In this historic movement moment it is critical to maintain solidarity with those who stepped up and are now being targeted as leaders. The legacy of genocide and broken treaties has shown us that when indigenous people stand up to protect the water and the land from the colonization of resources, we will always be met with repression and violence. Even if Water Protectors have a strong basis to fight their cases in court, the looming threat of high penalties discourages people from going to trial. The federal cases have often resulted in non-cooperating pretrial resolution offers, which mitigate the risk of high penalties and save defendants from the cumbersome psychological and financial consequences of sitting through unpredictable trials. According to WPLC, over 90 percent of state criminal cases in the United States are resolved without trial, either with a plea deal or a postponed dismissal agreement. Although WPLC has significant grounds to fight these cases in court, the organization is dedicated to ensuring that Water Protectors with open cases are aware of and can choose from as many positive options as possible. In April, WPLC announced its development of a new strategic plan. It hopes to gather input from Indigenous communities and allies about what future legal organizations serving movements to advance Indigenous sovereignty and rights should look like. In the meantime, WPLC is committed to fighting the 171 ongoing cases on behalf of Water Protectors. Free WordPress Theme created with by WPIon.

Today, the City of Seattle took an unprecedented stand against unethical banking practices by unanimously passing the Socially Responsible Banking Ordinance. The move sends a clear and powerful message that the people of Seattle expect our money to reflect and uphold our values. They can absorb some losses and afford lengthy court proceedings that those with little or no capital cannot. Without access to the same level of funding, we must use many different strategies to even the playing field, like direct action and media pressure. But our most effective weapon against well-moneyed opposition is divestment. In other words, when businesses or institutions show that they do not speak for us, that they do not value us, or that they are willing to put profits ahead of people and the planet, then we do not give them one dime. We must make it painful for institutions that elect to harm Native communities in the interest of the Dakota Access Pipeline. There are 17 banks that directly finance the pipeline construction by Dakota Access LLC. Seven of them also provide significant lines of credit to parent companies Energy Transfer Partners, Energy Transfer Equity, and Sunoco Logistics. Divesting from these institutions is more important than ever now that Donald Trump has signed an Executive Action to continue construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. This Executive Action will be challenged in court, but that will be a costly, drawn-out process. And even then there are no guarantees that the courts will side with the will of the people. The financial backing of the Dakota Access pipeline is, of course, just one of the many reasons to cut financial ties with major institutions such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, US Bank, JP Morgan Chase and Citibank. These corporations have a history of predatory lending practices and fabrication of personal bank accounts. For many of us in Seattle, however, financing DAPL was the final straw. City and Municipality Divestment The Seattle City Council was only recently introduced to the notion of divestment by Matt Remle (Hunkpapa) of Last Real Indians and Seattle City Councilwoman Kshama Sawant. Aided by the urging of local organizers and amplified by national movements like the Injustice Boycott, the ordinance was passed within a matter of weeks. This was no small victory. It was proof that collective economic protests work, and that we should use them to hold big business and our public representatives accountable. For Native people and their allies, divesting from unethical institutions like Wells Fargo is only one step in our multi-faceted fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, We must band together to be successful against such well-moneyed, politically connected opposition.

Now, if you are not prepared to do that, we do have an agenda that we must follow. They can absorb some losses and afford lengthy court proceedings that those with little or no capital cannot. Without access to the same level of funding, we must use many different strategies to even the playing field, like direct action and media pressure. In other words, when businesses or institutions show that they do not speak for us, that they do not value us, or that they are willing to put profits ahead of people and the planet, then we do not give them one dime. We must make it painful for institutions that elect to harm Native communities in the interest of the Dakota Access Pipeline. from these institutions is more important than ever now that Donald Trump has signed an Executive Action to continue construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. This Executive Action will be challenged in court, but that will be a costly, drawn-out process. And even then there are no guarantees that the courts will side with the will of the people. financial backing of the Dakota Access pipeline is, of course, just one of the many reasons to cut financial ties with major institutions such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, US Bank, JP Morgan Chase and Citibank. These corporations have a history of predatory lending practices and fabrication of personal bank accounts. Aided by the urging of local organizers and amplified by national movements like the Injustice Boycott, the ordinance was passed within a matter of weeks. This was no small victory. Native people and their allies, divesting from unethical institutions like Wells Fargo is only one step in our multi-faceted fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, We must band together to be successful against such well-moneyed, politically connected opposition.

On February 22, the Oceti Oyate camp, formerly known as Oceti Sakowin, as well as all other camps on treaty land claimed by the US Army Corps, were ordered to evacuate by 2pm. Hundreds flocked back to Standing Rock to pray as the company resumed drilling under the Missouri River following the granting of the final easement by the US Army Corps on February 7th. Ten unarmed water protectors were arrested and one was badly injured in a violent crackdown. Several of those arrested were journalists and legal observers, clearly targeted for their role in documenting police violence and rights violations. One water protector was tazed Fires kept law enforcement from entering the camps, but they continue to build presence at Standing Rock, preparing to forcibly remove water protectors from unceded territory affirmed in the 1851 and 1868 Ft. Laramie Treaties as sovereign land of the Great Sioux Nation. A contingent of nearly two dozen National Park Service rangers and U.S. Park Police officers arrived at the request of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe with tactical gear ranging from gas masks and riot gear to rifles, protective vests, and night vision goggles. The Sacred Stone Camp is standing ground, but raids on the remaining camps could happen at any moment. If you witnessed an arrest today at Standing Rock, are arrested, or are concerned about the possible arrest of a relative or loved one, please call the legal jail support line: 605.519.8180. With law enforcement preparing to advance, the legal teams are standing by (Freshet Collective and Water Protector Legal Collective - www.waterprotectorlegal.org ) and will continue to work around the clock to support and stand in solidarity with water protectors. Over 700 water protectors are now fighting criminal cases, and North Dakota is handing down convictions. Six people face federal charges, which carry sentences of up to 15 years. At least one grand jury is active and issuing indictments. Federal agents are knocking on doors at the homes of water protectors and their families. Meanwhile, reactionary legislation targeting water protectors continues to advance through the North Dakota House and Senate. The legal defense of those needing support is going to take a long time, possibly years, and will be very expensive. We are very grateful for your support. The runners delivered 140,000 petition signatures to the US Army Corps of Engineers and rallied at the White House to ask President Obama to pressure them to repeal the water crossing permits. The threats this pipeline poses to the environment, public health, and tribal and human rights are strikingly similar to those posed by the Keystone XL. We are not expendable.

Just minutes earlier, she and the rest of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe learned that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers won't grant an easement that would have allowed construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) to cross under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River. Her joy is tangible, her infectious laugh punctuating every sentence. Klein asks her how she feels about the news. Then, she breaks down in tears. It's a short video, just over a minute long. Now, young Native American activists are looking ahead, focused on the very future Iron Eyes mentioned. While Sunday's victory is historic and certainly cause for celebration, Indigenous people have quickly called for continued vigilance, especially from young activists on social media. She says there's been an atmosphere of celebration as well as apprehension over the past few days, especially because they don't know what will happen when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Sunday's decision was made by the Obama administration, which will transition power to an administration that supports the completion of the pipeline project. But we must remain cautious, Trump is right next in line. And many activists and water protectors say the good news won't erase the reported human rights abuses that have taken place. While Reuters reported that Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, asked those who are not Sioux to leave the area for the winter on Tuesday, water protectors aren't planning to leave anytime soon. In March, when they heard about plans to reroute the Dakota Access Pipeline away from Bismarck and through sacred land, they took action. As part of the Standing Rock Youth, a group of about 30 young people from the Standing Rock Sioux community, they decided to go online, and make their issue known. By now, it has more than 460,000 signatures, including endorsements from celebrities and influencers like Leonardo DiCaprio, Shailene Woodley, Bill McKibben and Ndaba Mandela. And those are the very people they wanted to galvanize. Native American Kids Standing Up Against Big Oil Company. READ, SIGN & SHARE our petition. On July 15, the group also organized a 2,000-mile relay race to Washington, D.C. to deliver their petition. That same day, the camp received notice that construction on the pipeline would begin. Like the young people before her, Ladonna Brave Bull Allard grabbed her iPhone, made a video and posted it to Facebook. While Native-led news outlets, such as The Last Real Indians and Indian Country Today, have covered the pipeline and its threat of sacred land since the beginning, most mainstream news outlets didn't give the story attention until August. That's when thousands of water protectors and allies assembled to physically block construction, and when the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia heard the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's lawsuit. Since then, the movement's grown exponentially. When the situation at Standing Rock became especially tense in September, as North Dakota law enforcement unleashed dogs and pepper spray on water protectors, those at Standing Rock uploaded videos to Facebook and Twitter to show the rest of the world what was happening. In October, Native American activists and allies started using Facebook Live and other videos on the social network to further broadcast standoffs with police. She witnessed, in real-time, a police officer macing her little sister in the Youth Council with a large canister for an extended period of time. And they seemed pretty shaken by that. The tool, Wise says, has allowed large numbers of people to understand what's actually happening on the ground. Later that month, thousands of allies started checking in to the Standing Rock Reservation on Facebook, in an attempt to confuse police after rumors that they were monitoring the social network to keep track of water protectors. However, local law enforcement denied this, which meant the effort, while well-intentioned, didn't achieve what allies hoped. Dallas Goldtooth (Mdewakanton Dakota and Dine), an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, told Mashable in October that he felt the Facebook check-ins actually helped generate support. Beyond media attention, the impact of these social media campaigns is felt within Indigenous communities, too. Wise says the movement has very much been about the youth reclaiming their own power, especially since many elders may not live to see the true impact of their decisions. But it's also about showing the incredible solidarity across various Indigenous communities that have converged on Standing Rock, and the powerful moments they share. The wide sentiment among activists is that it's a temporary victory, especially as a Trump administration looms. That includes further honing their social media skills. Wise says one thing Indigenous youth and other water protectors have learned is to make hard copies of everything they post online. They've encountered instances in which Facebook has removed posts, or technical issues randomly shorten or delete posts. They're also learning how best to navigate Facebook's algorithm, working to make sure people can see what's happening in real-time and remain educated. The fight is NOT OVER. Let's kill the Black Snake. The Sacred Stone Camp released a series of 10 questions water protectors encourage everyone to ask in the coming days and weeks, including when the Army Corps will conduct an Environmental Impact Statement, and to what extent will there be tribal input.

For now, water protectors at Standing Rock are standing firm, showing no signs of going anywhere and making sure their allies know the fight isn't over. I don't know. And that uncertainty is terrifying. But she also feels that the water protectors' prayers have gotten stronger. For the foreseeable future, they still will. youth used social media savvy to start the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline.

In preparation, we've been helping plan the next international day of action targeting banks to divest from the dangerous project. Today, Bank DNB announced it is going to sell its assets in the Dakota Access Pipeline project. Original petition text: Over 100 water protectors were brutally arrested by Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) security forces -- some locked in dog kennels and shot at with rubber bullets and pepper spray -- just for standing up for their ancestral lands and our most precious resource, water. Thousands have peacefully gathered in person and in solidarity to stop this 570,000 barrel-per-day pipeline that would endanger the water and ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. And while this inspiring work is going on, the banks that we use every day are backing the project with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and investment each. Demand your bank to stop financially supporting from the Dakota Access Pipeline and associated projects such as Energy Transfer now. North Dakota recorded nearly 300 oil pipeline spills in less than two years -- and none were disclosed to the public. The DAPL was originally going to be routed near the city of Bismarck -- but was rejected because it would have run so close to municipal water sources. Bank DNB, BBVA, TD, Wells Fargo, Mizuho Bank, BayernLB, Citibank, ING, Deutsche Bank, RBC, Credit Suisse, UBS, Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole, Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, and ABN Amro Capital all support the project financially. These banks are vulnerable to public pressure. We are their customers and shareholders -- and they need our business. Stop the money, stop a pipeline. Tell your bank to stop funding the project now. What we are bearing witness to at Standing Rock is a moment of history. We can't all be in North Dakota, but we can all stand in solidarity with those who are. Which is why after you sign the petition, we will list other ways you can support to help the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe stop the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of CREDO activists who stood with our indigenous and climate movement allies in North Dakota, we temporarily blocked construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, but our fight to stop the pipeline once and for all is not yet over. But we have the collective financial power as consumers and account holders to stop the pipeline. We must call on these banks to divest from this massive project immediately before Trump can approve the construction of the pipeline. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline. As of Jan. 1, ETP has effectively failed to meet its contractual obligations to deliver oil through the Dakota Access pipeline. Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline. By staying invested in these projects, these 17 banks are tacitly waging a coordinated campaign to destroy sacred Native lands and silence peaceful protest. This could be our last shot at stopping the Dakota Access pipeline before Donald Trump takes office on January 20. We stood with the water protectors and our allies in the climate justice movement to put a halt to the pipeline once before, and we must stand with them again to shut this project down for good.

Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline.

This could be our last shot at stopping the Dakota Access pipeline before Donald Trump takes office on January 20.

The fourth camp, (yet unnamed) will be in Dunnellon for the people who wish to support opposition to the compressor station.

We need many protectors to help record and document violations and to file reports. Come and join us if you want to learn more about this process and build resistance with respect and community. Workshops are filling up. Remember, it's everyone's responsibility to protect Florida and our environmental resources. These camps will be the first indigenous led camps in the state. The grassroots activists and Water Protectors of Stop Sabal Trail were the original online organizers working to stop the Sabal Trail Pipeline and are joining the camps to form an environmental protector alliance sanctioned by the Seminole Tribe of North Florida. The already existing Crystal Water Camp that was located at Ft. Drum, Florida will be moving to one of these locations. Experienced activists, water protectors, trainers, campers and families are welcome. The campers will adhere to peace and creative non-violence. No weapons, drugs, alchohol, violence or pets (except service animals) at any of the locations. These will not be direct action camps. No signage, markings or public identification by participants will be permitted for security reasons. In Levy County, Sabal Trail Transmission is installing a portion of a 516 mile, fracked gas (methane) pipeline. Violations have been duly noted and documented at the work sites by activists as the crews are rapidly installing this pipeline with no oversight. Today a concerned resident who has been carefully documenting the violations being done by the Sabal Trail Transmission employee's, Price Gregory workers and crews from affiliated companies had her modem melt down while sending her documentation to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and other agencies.

Complete shut down and modem disabled. Phone also disabled. Guess someone wants to silence her. In addition, members of Stop Sabal Trail in Levy County have had issues with full voice mail inboxes on their phones, scrambling of audio once calls are connected and repeated disconnections when dialing specific phone numbers.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has directed agents handling terrorism prevention to investigate a number of activists involved in the Dakota Access Pipeline protests at Standing Rock, The Guardian writes in an extensive new report. Their line of inquiries and the scope of the investigation is not yet known, and the F.B.I. declined comment to The Guardian. Each protector refused to do so. All of the visits were conducted after President Donald Trump's inauguration, Regan said. Last week, Trump signed an executive order resuming construction the Dakota Access Pipeline after protests forced the Obama administration to halt construction in 2016. On Wednesday, drilling beneath the Missouri river resumed. Regan believes that allegations of protestor violence by the Dakota police led to the F.B.I.'s investigation, which may have began in November 2016 when F.B.I. officers visited Sophia Wilansky, an environmental activist who was severely injured at the Standing Rock protests by what witnesses claim was a police concussion grenade (police say activists set off the explosion). The F.B.I. has a long history of persecuting civil rights and activists groups. COINTELPRO was launched in 1956 by F.B.I. director J. Edgar Hoover to target domestic political groups. Martin Luther King Jr. was a prolific target, and Black Panther leader Fred Hampton was assassinated in a COINTELPRO-sponsored raid. The agency was condemned after the program's dissolution in 1971 in a report from the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations.

Having shares in the pipeline could give First Nations communities a stake in the success in the project, and give the federal government some leverage in its pro-pipeline stance, despite opposition from several Indigenous groups living on or near the coast. That will be the focus of a meeting between First Nations and the federal government later this month. Roughly 23 other First Nations in B.C. that are not directly on the route have signed mutual benefit agreements. Matthew's main concern about the pipeline getting a green light is the environment he said. Traditional territory identified by the Simpcw First Nation extends over 5,000,000 hectares, a third of the Trans Mountain Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion route.

But Trump's right-wing admirers around the country have seized on a strategy to push back against mass protest--by criminalizing it. Lawmakers in multiple states are proposing measures explicitly designed to curtail dissent. In perhaps the most stunning example, a Republican lawmaker in North Dakota has introduced a bill, known as HB 1203, that would exempt motorists who unintentionally injure or kill people engaged in protests on public roads from facing any criminal penalties or damages. Yes, you read that right--a North Dakota lawmaker wants to make it legal to run over protesters who have taken over a road--a tactic that, of course, has a long history, notably among civil rights activists. North Dakota Rep. Keith Kempenich introduced the bill explicitly in response to the protests against construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. With the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announcing that it would be approve an easement needed to complete the DAPL, the potential for new confrontations--and a violent attack on protesters--will only increase if Kempenich gets his way. IN SOME cases, the proposed laws against dissent target specific groups of protesters--like a Michigan law that passed by the state House in a lame-duck session in December, which is aimed at hobbling unions and the right to strike and picket. While Republicans tried to claim the legislation would only affect those engaged in violent protest, in reality, it would give the state and employers wide latitude to clamp down. There are also novel new interpretations of existing laws as well. Recently, Martinville Police Chief Calder Hebert told KATC News that the Blue Lives Matter law applies to those who resist arrest--meaning arrested protesters hit with the common-enough charge of resisting could also face hate crimes charges. But the most ridiculous proposal so far has to be legislation North Carolina state Sen. Dan Bishop is vowing to introduce that would protect public officials from being heckled. ATTEMPTS TO curtail the right to free speech and protest are nothing new, but this latest wave not only betrays the fears of the right at the tide of opposition toward their hero in the White House. And squelching burgeoning protests and growing movements is definitely in their interests. Nothing is as threatening to those in power as when masses of ordinary people begin to organize and mobilize--which is why we will likely see more such laws proposed. We need to be prepared to fight to protect our right to speak out at each turn--like protesters did in Minnesota, when a House committee voted the measure to make protesters financially liable for police costs. That bill is specifically meant to crack down on the Black Lives Matter protests that erupted following the police shootings of Jamar Clark and Philando Castile. After voting in favor of the proposed legislation, Republican lawmakers abruptly adjourned the meeting when protesters erupted in shouts. It will be up to us to build movements strong enough to make that lesson clear to those in power.

Now, Wood Jr. and Clark Jr. are attempting to organize a mass, nonviolent protest against police action in North Dakota. Just this past weekend, a female protester was hit with a concussion grenade, causing severe damage to her arm and requiring surgery.

Charger was shocked. In the weeks that followed, more teenagers on the reservation killed themselves with belts, knives and handfuls of Benadryl. Native American teenagers and young adults are 1.5 times as likely to kill themselves as the national average, with suicides often clustering in epidemics that hit and fade. By the end of that summer, Jasilyn told me, 30 Cheyenne River kids attempted and eight completed. Their elders liked to talk about them as the future, but no one seemed to pay much attention to how their lives were hard, bordering on hopeless. Cheyenne River kids had families struggling with poverty and parents and relatives with serious drug-abuse problems. Often there was violence at home, to the point that many youths had nowhere safe to go at night. And amid all this, there was a hard-edged social pressure to drink or use drugs. Charger had seen all of this. But her mother called her in as a runaway one too many times, and the South Dakota Division of Child Protection Services took both girls, sending them to group homes on opposite sides of the state. She got so depressed she was moved to a psychiatric unit, where she often got into fights. She aged out of the system at 17, but when she returned to the ranch developments and trailer parks of Eagle Butte, she struggled with depression. She fell into a monthslong cocaine binge, crashing in abandoned cars with other homeless kids. Her weight had dropped to 80 pounds by the time that her cousin, Joseph White Eyes, intervened. In early 2015 she moved to Portland, as far away as she could get. Together with White Eyes and their friend, Trenton Casillas-Bakeberg, she formed a youth group. They raised money for basketball tournaments and for a youth trip to the Red Nation Film Festival in California, where the kids were able to see the ocean for the first time in their landlocked lives. They went to the tribal council, demanding and getting funds for a safe house for young people. Most of all they counseled young people, urging them to look out for one another and get involved. As the suicide wave crested and broke, the youth group, now called the One Mind Youth Movement, turned to something more political. They spent that fall as part of the local campaign against the Keystone XL pipeline, whose route would cut under the Cheyenne River just upstream from the reservation that bears its name. And after the Obama State Department denied the Keystone XL permission to cross the U.S.-Canadian border in November 2015, they moved their focus to the neighboring Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where the company Energy Transfer Partners was trying to build the Dakota Access Pipeline. That pipeline would move half a million barrels of oil a day beneath the Missouri River, the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux, which is one of the cousin bands to Cheyenne River, as well as for other downstream Sioux reservations. The youths came to believe that the Dakota pipeline was not only a threat to their drinking water but also a harbinger of the larger environmental crisis their generation was set to inherit. Over the next six months that camp grew into an improbable movement that united conservative farmers with the old radicals of the American Indian Movement; urban environmentalists with the traditional chiefs of hundreds of tribes. As Donald Trump pushes forward with the Keystone XL and Dakota Access, he will face a movement emboldened by a victory on Dec. 4, 2016, when the Department of the Army denied an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline and directed the Army Corps to consider an alternate route. It was a rare triumph for both the environmental and land rights movements, as well as for the American left in an otherwise dark moment. But little remarked upon at the time was the unlikely seed from which the movement had grown: an anti-suicide campaign among a tight-knit group of youths, most younger than 25, impelled by tragedy and guided by prophecy. At the start, the camp seemed like a quixotic undertaking. One Mind Youth made the two-hour drive north to propose setting up a prayer camp modeled on the ones raised against the Keystone XL. The tribal council agreed to set up the camp but offered little other support, pessimistic about the effort. The youths were undeterred. In early April, a handful, joined by a few former Keystone activists, moved into tepees in a protected ravine beside the Cannonball River, on the extreme north end of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Those days, the temperatures were in the 30s and there was still snow on the ground. The youths dubbed the camp Sacred Stone and lit the sacred fire. At first, they lived on little more than bologna sandwiches, potato chips and water. But then residents from the small reservation town of Cannon Ball, up the hill from Sacred Stone, began to bring donations: leftovers from dinner, cut-up wooden corrals for the campfires, a chain saw.

The previous fall, they rented a hotel room in Eagle Butte as an informal crash house for Cheyenne River youth, where sometimes as many as 20 teenagers stayed, sleeping and showering, safe from bullying or the lure of alcohol or drugs. The prayer camp at Standing Rock provided something similar. Members of One Mind would drive home every week to resupply and pick up youths who wanted to experience the camp. For Charger and other leaders, as important as the idea of the safe space was the idea that activism would teach children the skills to survive more immediate threats, like bullying and drug abuse. They hoped to pass on skills at the camp that they themselves had been taught by Keystone activists in their community. Every direct-action training against the Keystone XL, for example, referenced the prophecy of the black snake, a figure out of Lakota myth that in recent times has been identified with pipelines. The message was clear: The struggle against the pipeline was part of the same struggle against alcoholism, suicide and abuse. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After weeks at the Standing Rock camp with minimal tribal support, the young people decided that they needed to carry out some sort of public action. Bobbi Jean Three Legs, a young mother and long-distance runner from Standing Rock who had become active in the camp, had a vision. Her daughter woke her one night to ask for water, and she suddenly saw a day when, thanks to water pollution, there would be no water to give. Soon after that, she and White Eyes proposed a 500-mile relay run from the Sacred Stone Camp to Omaha to deliver a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers, asking it to deny the Dakota Access Pipeline permission to cross the Missouri River. The I.E.N. began a social-media campaign announcing the run and organized a blitz of calls and letters from tribal members on various reservations. Within days, far sooner than expected, an Army Corps representative from the Omaha district agreed to meet with members of the tribe. To some, this meant the youths could call off the run. But they insisted on going ahead. Not only did they still want support from the tribal council; they had also begun to believe that this run could bring together young people from all the Sioux reservations. One Mind saw water as an issue that could unify all Oceti Sakowin youth. And their run had rich cultural resonance: Before Europeans brought horses, long-distance messenger runners held the scattered tribes of Oceti Sakowin together. Three Legs, White Eyes and Charger mapped a route to pass through as many reservations as possible. The run would use a traditional method in which a messenger ran a short distance, about a mile, and then rested while another runner took his or her place. It allowed people who were not very good runners, like Charger, to go on a long-distance run. Daniel Grassrope, now 25, came from the Lower Brule, a band whose reservation lay down the Missouri from Cheyenne River. As a child, he dreamed of being taken away from his family and adopted by whites, something he associated, vaguely, with having his own bedroom and a mother who came to his basketball games. The run immediately gave him what Standing Rock would later give many other youths: a sense of purpose he had been lacking. It also inspired something more radical, in a way, than antipipeline activism: the belief that a group of lost people from scattered nations could still find kinship. Grassrope wrote to Three Legs immediately. On April 24, the runners set off south from the Sacred Stone Camp. They ran along the Cannonball River to Highway 1806, then down toward Cheyenne River, their first stop. Grassrope ran next to Charger, who was carrying a heavy staff that represented their ancestors. When she got too tired, Grassrope carried it. In doing so, according to Lakota belief, they were literally carrying all those who had come before. At every reservation, they met not only with tribal leaders but also with reservation youths, whom they talked to just as they had in Cheyenne River, telling them about the old ways and the camp upriver where those ways were being revived. Because the Native American community has become heavily networked on social media as a modern means to keep the bands united, word spread far beyond the communities they visited. When the youths arrived in Omaha on May 3, a representative of the Army Corps of Engineers met with them on the steps of the office. They still felt motivated as they went back to Standing Rock. Grassrope quit his job in Lower Brule and settled into the camp with them. On July 15, 30 runners set out from Sacred Stone, adding more as they made their way along their route. She was in bed asleep when Jasilyn, passing through Cheyenne River, ran into their house, threw her clothes into a bag and urged her onto their support van. Over the course of the next week or so, a dozen more joined. But on July 26, the runners learned the Army Corps of Engineers had approved the Dakota Access pipeline easements. The black snake was on its way. The runners decided to carry on to Washington, but the focus shifted back to the camp, as I.E.N. activists at Standing Rock urged people via Facebook messages to rise to the standard set by the youths. They loaded cars and buses and camper vans with donations and headed for Standing Rock. Twenty-six-year-old Eryn Wise moved to the camp in late August, at the beginning of what organizers called the big boom, when the population spiked from dozens to thousands. A native of Minneapolis, Wise was raised by her grandmother on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation after a suicide attempt at 11. On the reservation, she was picked on for excelling at school but was surrounded by her siblings, with whom she formed a close bond. But she returned to Minneapolis when she was 16 to care for her mother. When she read an article about the youth run she felt a pull and quit her job. She found her twin siblings, Alex and Lauren Howland, already at the camp. Photo Eryn Wise in Washington following the inauguration. The run, Goldtooth told me, had forced their support by transforming the Dakota Access pipeline from a regional Lakota issue into an international one. Standing Rock council members began to visit the camps and pay for emergency services, propane and portable toilets. The Council Lodge was the traditional meeting place of the Oceti Sakowin in the 19th century, when the bands would gather on the Plains. It was part of a larger move toward formalizing the prayer camps under a council government. By then, the protests against the pipeline had, for the traditional leadership, become about far more: They had become a long-prophesied end to history. Not just to its people. Many of the youths that I spoke with took this to mean the Seventh Generation had a sort of messianic role to help restore order, on behalf of all beings, to a world thrown out of balance by modernity and greed. The Seventh Generation tracks roughly with millennials of all races, but they share their own unique history. The generation between Goldtooth, 34, and Charger, now 20, is the first to have grown up free to be Indian. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

In early September, the Seven Council Fires and Chief Arvol Looking Horse, who, for the Lakota Sioux, is something like their head of religion, gave the youths a gift: a chanupa, the ceremonial pipe that is the most sacred element of the Plains religion, a symbol of the knitting together of the human community and nature, ancestors with the living. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this gesture. We said they had to be of pure mind. After the ceremony, the youths, who had begun to call themselves the International Indigenous Youth Council, or I.I.Y.C., to symbolize their desire to unite all nations behind a traditional way of life, moved together into a tepee by the Cannonball River. The I.I.Y.C. was the first experience of family for many members. She shrugged. Charger was referring to Native American history, not just what happened on the frontier but also in more recent decades. After federal campaigns reduced the Oceti Sakowin in the late 1800s, there were nearly 100 years of calculated assault as the state tried to force Native Americans to assimilate. The unified nation of Oceti Sakowin was broken into widely separated reservations, and after Congress privatized reservation land, many starving Lakota families had to sell off their property to white farmers, further cutting the size of reservations. But perhaps most devastating to their psychological health were the boarding schools, in which generations of Indians were sent to schools to be taught white culture. This system reached its nadir in the forced assimilation campaigns of the 1940s and 1950s, when the grandparents of many of the I.I.Y.C. youths were taught English literally under the lash. At Standing Rock, the youths felt they were developing the means to overcome that trauma. The key, as Charger explained it, was to let their history go, which they took as an almost holy responsibility: Forgive, and then take action to spare those who are coming in the future. For many, this provided a means to re-establish difficult relationships with parents or siblings. But it also helped bind them together into their own sort of family. In the final months of 2016, the camps at Standing Rock grew to more than 10,000, filling with indigenous peoples from hundreds of nations, climate-change activists, members of the Rainbow Family and Burning Man communities and those who simply felt a call. By that point, the role of the I.I.Y.C. had become a sort of advance guard, taking risks and pushing actions forward and winning new young converts to the cause. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thomas Tonatiuh Lopez Jr. was one. A 24-year-old Lakota and Latino from Denver, Lopez grew up the child of AIM and Chicano activists, and as the adopted grandson of the powerful medicine man Leonard Crowdog. Once he found himself at the camp, Lopez was touched by the message of activism and reconciliation. One afternoon, he was sitting with I.I.Y.C. members, rolling cigarettes for everyone in front of a fire, as Charger talked about the role of youth. He thought about it as he drove home to Denver, and when he got there, he helped establish a local I.I.Y.C. chapter, drawing from local indigenous and Latino youths. In mid-November, the group took hundreds of Denver high-school students for a march through downtown to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline. The images of campers being maced or attacked by dogs spread anger across the country, and many brought that anger to Standing Rock. For traditional leadership, any violence was deeply concerning. Part of the matrix of prophecy that underlies their movement is the idea that should the Oceti Sakowin or their allies resort to violence, they could be wiped out. The youths took this seriously, even as they found themselves under physical threat. Wise, the camp mom, remembers, for instance, watching on Facebook Live as her sister was maced. Furious, she raced to the scene and threw herself at the police. Suddenly there were six hands on her shoulders: I.I.Y.C. members, pulling her back. She saw her brother Alex, his face white with what appeared to be war paint. But on Dec. 2, when the department posted on Facebook soliciting donations of granola bars, fruit soda and socks, the I.I.Y.C. showed up with large plastic containers filled with granola bars, warm clothing and water. The station was on lockdown; after a while, an officer looking sheepish in his helmet, faceplate and full body armor, opened the door and accepted the containers. Lopez half turned. It was a small gesture, but one that prompted thanks from the officers and anger from some in the camps. Wise remembers people asking. But prophecy was important to the youths; they worried that if the movement became too violent, it would ruin everything they had been trying to build. On Dec. 4, 2016, as thousands of military veterans from across the country crowded the camp in solidarity, the Department of the Army announced its decision to deny an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline route. The decision was a shock and an unexpected triumph. Now, with winter bearing down, he said, everyone could begin to go home. For them, leaving was more complicated. There was also a more personal problem. Many of them had nowhere else to go. They had become dependent on the I.I.Y.C. for a support network and a place to live. Over their months spent in close quarters, the members of the youth council had bound themselves together not only as friends but as family. The stakes of dissolving the group had become obvious in a more immediate way, too: One of the youth runners had already attempted suicide and been rushed to the hospital in Bismarck. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the camps emptied out, though, there were not enough resources for everyone to stay, and most of the young people dispersed for the winter, leaving behind a skeleton crew of 10. Wise went home to Minneapolis to begin a job as an organizer for Honor the Earth, an indigenous environmental activist group. Grassrope went back to Lower Brule. Charger was couch-surfing with friends in Eagle Butte. But the I.I.Y.C. were in the process of setting up a 501(c)(3), a nonprofit organization that would allow them to establish some formal order to what had been an ad hoc group. And in January, after a month apart, the I.I.Y.C. youths reunited in Washington for the mass protests against Donald Trump. They were still in Washington when the news came that he had signed executive orders allowing the Dakota Access and Keystone pipelines to proceed. After that, Jasilyn Charger made the trip back to Standing Rock. She planned to spend a couple of days there before heading south to Eagle Butte, where she would organize against the Keystone. He offered a practical reason as well: In December, back home in Denver, he got a call from a young person on the verge of suicide. Even if you feel no one loves you, no one cares about you, I love you, I care about you. I want to pray with you again. He paused.

NITV: You talk about the fight against the pipeline in relation to climate change and colonialism. KPW: Colonialism is essentially climate change. So at one level, when one society colonises another they force that society to live under different environmental conditions, often times climate conditions, than it was living in before. We were displaced and colonised to make way for the industries that would bring us climate change. We know now today, through numerous scientific reports, that its Indigenous people widely who will be harmed the most from the climate change impacts. MORE ON THIS STORY North Dakota pipeline protest: the largest gathering of Native Americans in more than 100 years Thousands of people from across the United States and Canada have set up camp in North Dakota in recent weeks to block the construction of a pipeline that would run through Standing Rock Indian Reservation. With Standing Rock, the US acknowledges that there are treaties in place, but over time have neglected those treaties to such a degree, that it no longer makes sense from a US perspective or a settler perspective to honour those treaty areas. In that sense, one of the big issues in the US regarding treaty rights is the interpretation of what the treaty means. Treaty rights are not the only way in which native people fight for our rights, for our freedom, for our wellbeing, but for tribes that they have them, they are one way that we can attempt to protect ourselves.

Photo courtesy of Jaida Grey Eagle . The Standing Rock movement continues the momentum of Indigenous and other women-led social and environmental movements. As a Dakota, one way I interpret these movements is as caretaking kin, but I must clarify this designation. First, I use kin in ways that contradict patriarchal White settler ideas of it. Second, although I see women-led movements as caretaking, I do not view caretaking as the sole domain of cisgendered, biologically-reproductive women. Nor do I view women as being the only members of our communities who caretake. Men and gender-nonconforming people, and brave youth (who deserve particular recognition) also help caretake our peoples, make relations, and add to our collective strength. But nevertheless, the women-led condition of these movements is striking (see Wilson 2015). It organized round dances in public spaces as well as blockades of rail lines and highways in order to call attention to fossil-fuel and other industry infringements on Indigenous land rights. Ladonna Bravebull Allard, Standing Rock Sioux, has written about the DAPL in the context of histories of settler colonialism and Indigenous genocide. While Indigenous people have been killed outright, another eliminatory tactic has been to sever our sustaining relations with other-than-human relatives. Bravebull Allard writes about continued police violence against nonviolent, prayerful Water Protectors while the all-White, heavily armed militia led by Cliven Bundy was acquitted after its armed takeover of federal land. Today, as in earlier centuries, the colonial U.S. state and its White supremacist citizens, whether armed ranchers or oil industry executives and their private security henchmen, work to eliminate Indigenous peoples from these lands and they work to eliminate our relations with these lands, ensuring White occupation and profit in the process. They heard them talking about the campfires and the Horse Nation. Here, Nation and people are translations for the Lakota word Oyate. Rather, Indigenous women-led movements provide alternative visions for being better relatives with each other and the planet. Their work will go beyond these camps. I have faith in these women-led movements. Two Spirit leadership is also key. A Two Spirit camp was established at Standing Rock. BLM emerged in 2013 after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, killer of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin. BLM responded to multiple acts of police brutality against Black people nationwide. Black Lives Matter. . . . BLM activists also work for criminal justice reform, the rights of trans and gender non-conforming people, domestic workers, immigrant justice, and human rights. Their organizing demonstrates powerful (queer) women-led governance. I see them caretaking their peoples and others as they defend bodies marginalized in a brutal anti-Black, antitrans, anti-immigrant, and antiworker world. References Wilson, Alex. 2015.

Original petition text: Over 100 water protectors were brutally arrested by Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) security forces -- some locked in dog kennels and shot at with rubber bullets and pepper spray -- just for standing up for their ancestral lands and our most precious resource, water. Thousands have peacefully gathered in person and in solidarity to stop this 570,000 barrel-per-day pipeline that would endanger the water and ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. And while this inspiring work is going on, the banks that we use every day are backing the project with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and investment each. Demand your bank to stop financially supporting from the Dakota Access Pipeline and associated projects such as Energy Transfer now. North Dakota recorded nearly 300 oil pipeline spills in less than two years -- and none were disclosed to the public. The DAPL was originally going to be routed near the city of Bismarck -- but was rejected because it would have run so close to municipal water sources. Bank DNB, BBVA, TD, Wells Fargo, Mizuho Bank, BayernLB, Citibank, ING, Deutsche Bank, RBC, Credit Suisse, UBS, Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole, Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, and ABN Amro Capital all support the project financially. These banks are vulnerable to public pressure. We are their customers and shareholders -- and they need our business. Stop the money, stop a pipeline. Tell your bank to stop funding the project now. What we are bearing witness to at Standing Rock is a moment of history. We can't all be in North Dakota, but we can all stand in solidarity with those who are.

Several dams are scheduled to be removed in 2020, but a proposed pipeline has raised fears that construction and leaks could threaten a revitalized river. For millenniums, the Klamath, Modoc and Yahooskin Band of Snake Indians fished salmon from the lake and the river. After dams were built on the river starting in 1912, the salmon were blocked. The Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline would run 229 miles from Malin to Coos Bay, Ore., crossing underneath the Klamath River near the city of Klamath Falls. It would extend, via interconnections, the Ruby Pipeline, carrying natural gas from Wyoming to a huge planned storage and export terminal for sales to countries in the Pacific Rim. The company behind the pipeline, Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline LP, and the export terminal, Jordan Cove Energy Project LP, are both owned by the Pembina Pipeline Corporation, based in Calgary, Alberta. Now the companies are trying again, though the commission said they had failed to show there was market demand for the project. Image A protest in 2016 against Jordan Cove LNG and its plan to build the Pacific Connector natural gas pipeline in Oregon. If the pipeline gets built, the initial construction jobs will disappear as soon as it is done. As far as the Klamath people are concerned, this pipeline is a bad idea even if the price of gas were predicted to skyrocket. The Klamath people oppose this project because it puts at risk their watersheds, forests, bays, culture, spiritual places, homes, climate and future. If the pipeline catches fire or leaks, the Klamath River and its fish will be put at risk. The track record of fossil fuel pipelines suggests such a calamity is only a matter of time. Though natural gas generates lower greenhouse gas emissions than coal, it is still a fossil fuel. Leaks during extraction, transport and burning of gas all contribute to climate change. Notably, several state agencies do have the power to deny permits and stop the pipeline from being built. The Klamath Tribes, along with the Yurok and Karuk, hundreds of landowners, conservation groups, and concerned citizens, have registered as intervenors to have legal standing to dispute this pipeline. Just as the tribes along the river shared the salmon in the old days, those tribes will work together to protect their shared river today. As long as this proposal hangs over the river, the Klamath will stand in fierce, firm and unwavering opposition.

With Medea Benjamin, Vijay Prashad, Jillian Schwedler, and Ingar Solty. Focusing on different regions, we will look at what to expect in terms of strategic alliances, shifting partnerships, conflict resolution, multilateralism, environmental policies, and more. This panel will bring together international and American experts who will try to explain how the new administration might reshape the current world order, and what the progressive global community should expect in coming years. Medea Benjamin will lead the discussion, providing an overview on the potentially radical shifts expected in US foreign policy. Ingar Solty will then discuss impacts on Europe. Jillian Schwedler will tackle the challenges facing the Middle East under this new administration, and Vijay Prashad will close by analyzing the implications of a Trump presidency for the global South. Afterwards, the speakers will sit together for a more open-ended discussion of US foreign policy under Trump. Triggered by the unpredictability of a Trump administration, this event will seek to offer a peek toward the deeply difficult years ahead of us. It will also try to provide tools to help us make sense of the world we live in and to understand how the struggle for a new system of global governance is more relevant today than ever. A Palestine Action Time: Fri. BRING FAMILY AND FRIENDS. SHARE WIDELY. WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. There will also be cash and Venmo donation options at the event. This event will use the story of Lower East Side squatters, who occupied abandoned city-owned buildings in the 1980s, fought to keep them for decades, and are now completing a long, complicated process to turn their illegal occupancy into legal cooperative ownership, to explore these questions. Ours to Lose not only tells a little-known New York story, it also shows how property shapes our sense of ourselves as social beings and explores the ethics of homeownership and debt in post-recession America. In this listening party and discussion Amy Starecheski, an oral historian, anthropologist, and former squatter, will play some of the oral histories on which the book is based and facilitate a conversation about the relevance of this history in the present moment. All are welcome. Books will be for sale, and refreshments will be served. All royalties from the sale of Ours to Lose go to Picture the Homeless. Amy Starecheski is co-director of the Oral History Master of Arts program at Columbia University. She received a PhD in cultural anthropology from the CUNY Graduate Center, where she was a Public Humanities Fellow. Readers will include Emily Skillings, Catherine Pond, and Jen Hyde among others. The floor will be open to any and all writers. Please feel free to bring any work to present, either your own or by others, that has helped you through this turbulent political season. We also welcome reflections, commentaries, and discussion. This event will be hosted by Gabriela Garcia and Halley Furlong-Mitchell. We hope you may join us as we mobilize together through poetry to help process this moment and to empower and support each other, especially those most at risk. We hope that this will be a gathering in the spirit of community and togetherness, meeting intolerance and atrocity with love, empathy, imagination and resistance. NYC Socialists Red Holiday Party Time: Fri. From millions supporting an open socialist Presidential candidate to the election of billionaire bigot Donald Trump. And 2016 is the year in which the Standing Rock Sioux have stood up to the combined forces of the oil companies and the state to protect their sovereign land rights and our water. There could also be no better time to become an organized socialist. Capitalism is certainly not working for most of us and we need a answer to this madness. All proceeds from the door and bar will be donated to a) the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council and b) the Water Protector Legal Collective (formerly Red Owl Legal Collective). Cash bar. No byob. Saturday, December 10 Organizer Training Time: Sat. OPEN TO EVERYONE. Non-CUNY peeps have to sign in at the West Building, so have an ID. Please note: Some portions will be CUNY-centric, but the techniques we will be going over are easily applied elsewhere. Please RSVP so a head count can be determined. All are welcome Send Love Through the Walls Time: Sat. This event is always a lot of fun, the food outstanding, the camaraderie lively, and the handmade cards flat out amazing. This year will be no different. So plan to bring your friends, your creativity, and a healthy appetite. When you go into the building, take the elevator to your left. This is manifest through the dual expectation that cultural producers work for exposure whilst institutional staff and contracted laborers work for less than a living wage. Arts-activist campaigns like W.A.G.E. and Gulf Labor have strategically focused on correcting certain inbuilt inequalities, but neither have yet incorporated a discussion of the economic underpinnings of white supremacy in the art system, despite it regularly being cited as one of the least diverse professional sectors. Decolonize This Place has operated on a maintenance economy that is more germane to movement-building work than the professional compensation structure of the established art world. In the years to come, with a Trump presidency likely to be hostile to the lifeblood of free and critical expression, movement art will be needed more than ever. Nitasha Dhillon Lise Soskolne (W.A.G.E.) Mabel Wilson David Joselit Eva Mayhabal Davis A Gallery Intern NoDAPL Party & Fundraiser with DJ Red Daughter & Flwrshrk Time: Sat. Late night dance party with DJ Red Daughter and FLWRSHRK spinning. The fight still continues. They are the on-the-ground legal support at Standing Rock. There are about 500 legal cases that lawyers are still trying to get through (and there are certain to be more coming up). Sunday, December 11 On the Ground Running: Protest Support Training Time: Sun. Our comrades are putting their bodies on the line, and they need our support in specific and tangible ways. In the spirit of solidarity and sustainability, join us as we practice and share skills for the difficult times ahead. The training is co-sponsored by the A.J. Muste Institute. Time: Sat. We are hosting a letter writing party where members, the local community and market shoppers can write and sign letters for the 12 Amnesty International cases identified for this campaign. These letters have been known to: help convince government officials to free prisoners of conscience, support human rights defenders, and end other urgent cases of abuse. Illumination Against Gentrification: Sign-Building Workshop Time: Sun. Meanwhile, anarchists, Black nationalists, communists, and socialists debate how to oppose capitalism and build the world anew. Anti-racist and anti-fascist brigades create marches, fundraisers, defense trainings, and direct actions. Cultural workers weaponize arts and literatures to counter the rise of a new imperial order. As post-Depression fascist regimes arose in the Dominican Republic, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain, Black and Jewish radicals co-organized against Jim Crow and anti-Semitic terror to form mass anti-capitalist coalitions. The event will be livestreamed and recorded, and a guide will be shared for future studies. Our informal gathering allowed us to connect with what is at stake for each of us in this work and continue building deeper together. In extension of community defense, we want our neighbors to visualize themselves in scenarios where they can protect their community members by plugging into a rapid response network that aims to intervene and can connect folks to sanctuary spaces in cases of emergencies. All are welcomed to attend and join the work, please bring some food to share. The State of Trans Health Care in New York Time: Sun. This workshop will broadly address some of the changes that may occur with the next administration change, featuring insight from legal, medical and public health experts in transgender medical care services.

The event will feature organizers who have been working on the front lines of climate, anti-police brutality, prison abolition, queer health, anti-War on Terror, anti-racist, and anti-bigotry movements. It will be livestreamed and recorded. SOHO20 is an organization that started in response to a time when women were disenfranchised in the art world and beyond. DAPL has used mace, attack dogs, rubber bullets, and now water cannons against peaceful and unarmed protestors. Please come by for a night of live music and words by indigenous artists and allies. Mission: Mobilizing women and allies to leverage our collective power as citizens for immediate action against any effort to erode the rights of women and other vulnerable groups. Strike out message: The president-elect has demonstrated overt contempt for women and a troubling sexual misogyny before and during his campaign. So we must take action ourselves.

In addition, we stand in solidarity with the myriad other groups the president-elect has maligned during his shameful campaign. Victory: On the 12th of December, women and allies in cities across the country unify to demonstrate our collective power. We deliver the message in a unified voice that we are ready to stand against any government action that would serve to erode the rights of women and other vulnerable groups.

Special guests who will share their experience in movements and as composers of rebel music are Abiodun Oyewole of The Last Poets & Mahina Movement. Free event. Spread the word. New York must end mass incarceration, promote community empowerment, stop state violence and torture, and end structural racism while protecting the rights of Black, Latino, Muslim, and Native people; women; LGBTI people; poor people of all backgrounds; people with mental health needs; and all New Yorkers. Toward these ends, New York must adopt parole and bail reform, HALT solitary confinement, close Rikers and Attica, raise the age of criminal responsibility, revamp all sentencing, restore voting rights and college access to people in prison, protect domestic violence survivors, and promote racial justice including through a truth, justice, and reconciliation commission. Please join us in the launch of this collective effort on Tues., Dec. 13 at the NYC City Hall front steps. Revolutionary Role Play: De-Escalation Time: Tues. The space is accessible for people with disabilities, with the exception of the restroom down a flight of stairs. An agenda will be sent out via email ahead of time. We need people with all skills and interests. Crimethinc: Preparing for the Trump Era: An Anarchist Viewpoint Time: Tues. This talk will be presented by Crimethinc: The Crimethinc. Politics in Public Space in Words and Pictures Time: Tues. LEN (a lawyer in history) provides us with historic perspectives on occupation from the case of the Chicago 7, and the newly re-issued War in the Neighborhood gives insight into gentrification and displacement from the viewpoint of the 1980s Lower East Side. LEN (A LAWYER IN HISTORY) is a a graphical biography of radical attorney Leonard Weinglass who represented the Chicago 7, Daniel Ellsberg, the Cuban 5 and many other political defendants. This book examines 60 years of American history through the life and work of one man, and is available now from AK Press. Now available in a new edition with an introduction by AK Thompson, it is a first hand account of the Squatters movement during which abandoned buildings were seized to make low income housing, and then had to be defended within a divided community. So many, that not all could fit in the space and many held a speak out at a nearby park. Committees are meeting this week. The anger is ripe, women are showing up for the movement in droves. We have the momentum to build real power. Wednesday, December 14 Panel on Intergenerational Trauma Time: Wed. The collective impacts of oppression and harm are passed down from one generation to the next. Light reception will follow. This evening was organized by the Icarus Project and co-sponsored by the Barnard Center for Research on Women. This event is located in the James Room on the 4th Floor of Barnard Hall. Barnard Hall is located immediately upon entering through the main gate of the Barnard College campus at Broadway and 117th Street (Manhattan). We must also expect that Trump and his cronies will halt, abandon or repeal recent progressive improvements in workers rights protections at the federal level. This forum will be an opportunity to strategize how we will continue to fight for economic justice and respect in the workplace, but also to tell our legislators, regulators, and allies the ways in which we expect them to stand up for and defend immigrant workers in New York. While this seems like a positive step in the right direction, we all know how Trump likes to say one thing and then do the exact opposite. Sort of like how he denounced White Supremacy and then appointed Stephen Bannon as his Chief Strategist. The same children who have appeared at numerous state functions and Trump administration planning meetings. He needs to understand that he will be held accountable every step of the way, and that we will hold him to his promises. Protest against the racist, misogynistic, anti-science appointments Trump has made, Protest against his implicit encouragement of hate crimes across the country, and against government corruption, nepotism, and favoritism to special interest groups. I will update when we have more info. Bring signs and most of all energy and a loud voice. Art After Trump Time: Thurs. Line-up to be announced. This event will directly benefit Housing Works, and no other entities involved are spending money or making money on the event. All performances at Housing Works are donations. Housing Works was started out of ACT UP, and we knew then that raising our own money would be essential to our survival and the survival of the communities we served, because the state and federal government was refusing to help. Trump and the Republican Party have pledged to overturn the Affordable Care Act, a critical platform Housing Works has leveraged to address disparities in health based on poverty, race, sexual orientation, and other markers. And we now know we are facing a federal assault on reproductive rights, LGBT rights, on immigrants and the cities and states that protect them. On December 15, we will gather members of the creative and artistic communities to speak for human rights, just as the founders of the AIDS movement did thirty years ago. We hope you will join us.

Protest Hillary Clinton Party to Thank Millionaire Donors Time: Thurs. Limousine Democrats gave us Trump and weve just about had it with them. At a time where change was demanded, the DNC decided to give us the same type of campaign that catered to the millionaire and billionaire class as well as Wall Street while ignoring the working people.. This is exactly why the Democratic party lost. Americans are turned off by the tone deaf approach that was carried out throught the primary and election. No we dont want Pelosi as minority leader and we want a DNC chair that will bring about the transformation that we desperately need.

This week's high-profile intervention was not the first time unarmed protesters have encountered police violence. Keene says part of the reason for the strong solidarity among Native tribes across the country is because the dispute over the the pipeline is part of a long-standing fight to have the sovereignty of their nations respected by the US government. These lands that the pipeline is cutting through right now are their homeland from time immemorial.. One advantage, however, is that Native people from the Plains are teaching the folks from warmer climates how to adapt, using lots of traditional methods from bonfires to longhouses. 6.

Originally from Bosnia, Beslik has seen his share of war and says that the Oceti Sakowin Camp reminded him of a war zone. The Standing Rock movement has brought a wave of financial rabble-rousing to the United States. He says activism aimed at banks is common in Europe. But the Standing Rock movement has brought a wave of financial rabble-rousing to the United States, and Beslik is just one of many people who believe it can strengthen the greater movement for divestment from fossil fuels, which is growing quickly. Think of divestment as the opposite of investment. By convincing firms to sell off stocks, bonds, and other investment assets in companies involved in extracting fossil fuels, activists hope to make it more difficult for these companies to get financing. Nordea has holdings in three companies behind the Dakota Access pipeline: Energy Transfer Partners, Sunoco Logistics, and Phillips 66. Nordea then sent Beslik to Standing Rock to meet with tribal representatives, including Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman David Archambault II. While there is widespread agreement on the goals of the divestment movement, advocates approach them differently. This week, Nordea came to a decision. The bank demanded that the companies behind DAPL reroute the oil pipeline so that it is does not pass near the reservation. Greenpeace regards this decision as significant. Its goal is not only to stop this pipeline completely but also others that imperil indigenous communities. While there is widespread agreement on the goals of the divestment movement, advocates approach them differently. Indeed, Standing Rock has set off campaigns focused on at least three major forms of divestment. First is the individual withdrawal of funds and bank account closures by tens of thousands of concerned citizens. Second is divestment by mutual funds and institutions, which sell off stocks and bonds invested in the companies. That may sound like a lot, but the numbers are relative. He points to the Royal Bank of Scotland, which has issued a statement saying it did just that. Beslik says Nordea and other banks interested in responsible investing need more information to guide any divestments they make. Clark Williams-Derry, director of energy finance at the Sightline Institute, a sustainability think-tank based in Seattle, agrees. Beslik thinks the movement needs to get better at doing this. Divestment activists should become more proactive in their strategies, he says, especially in regard to the financial, legal, and analytical data they provide banks. Prior to coming to Standing Rock, he slogged through 20 hours of reading material provided by the companies behind the Dakota Access pipeline. He says he would love to see indigenous communities, NGOs, and environmental organizations provide something comparable. Greenpeace USA spokesperson Mary Sweeters says a number of NGOs already do this kind of work, including Rainforest Action Network, Food & Water Watch, and Bank Track. Greenpeace, too, has campaigners dedicated to engaging the finance sector. For example, Citibank has internal corporate responsibility policies on indigenous, human, and environmental rights. These are based in part on the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet Citibank is a leader among the 38 banks offering credit to the Dakota Access pipeline companies. The role of Greenpeace is to put pressure on the banks to make sure they really do that. Indigenous financial advisers are joining the conversation, too. Instead, she says, the priority is to coordinate the divestment movement that rose up against the Dakota Access pipeline with larger, global divestment initiatives. Jamie Henn, a co-founder of the environmental group 350.org, agrees. And its successes are having an effect. Not surprisingly, the companies behind the pipeline oppose the strategy. No Paywall.

You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of CREDO activists who stood with our indigenous and climate movement allies in North Dakota, we temporarily blocked construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, but our fight to stop the pipeline once and for all is not yet over. But we have the collective financial power as consumers and account holders to stop the pipeline. We must call on these banks to divest from this massive project immediately before Trump can approve the construction of the pipeline. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline. As of Jan. 1, ETP has effectively failed to meet its contractual obligations to deliver oil through the Dakota Access pipeline. Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline. By staying invested in these projects, these 17 banks are tacitly waging a coordinated campaign to destroy sacred Native lands and silence peaceful protest. This could be our last shot at stopping the Dakota Access pipeline before Donald Trump takes office on January 20.

Attacks on the Media and Internet Critical to the success of movement actions is drawing public attention to them. A goal of popular movements is to grow by attracting more people to the movement, and especially to divide power holders (e.g. political parties, elected officials, business people, the media) and bring them to support the movement. The corporate mass media has always been a problem for movements seeking transformational change. Now, that is under attack.

Signs from ResistJ20 Inauguration protest by Megan Cloherty for WTOP. Responsibility of the Movement These attacks on dissent in court and in the media are reasons for the movement to escalate. While they continue their policies of concentration of wealth, as well as environmental destruction and war, they know people are organizing, responding and resisting. When we plan our actions, we must expect criminal or civil prosecution and use tactics that protect us while still allowing the movement to proceed with aggressive, strategic and sustained actions. Everyone in the movement should know that they will not be alone when the power holders go after them. And, with the attacks on the media, it becomes an important political act to re-post an article from Popular Resistance and other sites. It becomes a political act to tweet or forward social media posts. Our job has always been to spread the word and actions of the movement, now that becomes even more important. Let these attacks by government and big business become reasons to grow and unify the movement. There are people in the government, including in law enforcement, as well as people who work for corporate interests, including corporate media, who will recognize these actions as going too far and defect. We must pull these people into the movement, urge them to join us and to use their position as an insider to expose what is occurring. Every attack on the popular movement is more reason for us to join together, grow and mobilize. Every attack must be turned into an opportunity for us to build the strength of people power.

Wicks organized a 50-person brigade to provide a hearty Thanksgiving dinner to demonstrators - given in gratitude, she said, to those who have put themselves on the dangerous front line of a battle over clean water. That gesture of thanks and honor became part of a larger, uncertain tableau after Sunday, when police unloaded rubber bullets, tear gas, and water from hoses on protesters in 26-degree cold. Native medics said 26 people were taken to hospitals, including a woman whose arm was shattered by a projectile. Wicks, 69, initially wasn't sure how the offer of Thanksgiving food would be received. For many American Indians, Thanksgiving is a day of mourning, a time to consider the genocide carried out against their peoples. What began as a Philadelphia woman's plan to provide meals and moral backing has grown to include chefs and celebrities. Chef Jeremy Stanton is coming from Massachusetts to cook turkeys over open fires, Ben & Jerry's is sending ice cream, and the actress Jane Fonda will help serve - and contributed five butchered bison and four Mongolian yurts.

Charger was shocked. In the weeks that followed, more teenagers on the reservation killed themselves with belts, knives and handfuls of Benadryl. Native American teenagers and young adults are 1.5 times as likely to kill themselves as the national average, with suicides often clustering in epidemics that hit and fade. By the end of that summer, Jasilyn told me, 30 Cheyenne River kids attempted and eight completed. Their elders liked to talk about them as the future, but no one seemed to pay much attention to how their lives were hard, bordering on hopeless. Cheyenne River kids had families struggling with poverty and parents and relatives with serious drug-abuse problems. Often there was violence at home, to the point that many youths had nowhere safe to go at night. And amid all this, there was a hard-edged social pressure to drink or use drugs. Charger had seen all of this. But her mother called her in as a runaway one too many times, and the South Dakota Division of Child Protection Services took both girls, sending them to group homes on opposite sides of the state. She got so depressed she was moved to a psychiatric unit, where she often got into fights. She aged out of the system at 17, but when she returned to the ranch developments and trailer parks of Eagle Butte, she struggled with depression. She fell into a monthslong cocaine binge, crashing in abandoned cars with other homeless kids. Her weight had dropped to 80 pounds by the time that her cousin, Joseph White Eyes, intervened. In early 2015 she moved to Portland, as far away as she could get. Together with White Eyes and their friend, Trenton Casillas-Bakeberg, she formed a youth group. They raised money for basketball tournaments and for a youth trip to the Red Nation Film Festival in California, where the kids were able to see the ocean for the first time in their landlocked lives. They went to the tribal council, demanding and getting funds for a safe house for young people. Most of all they counseled young people, urging them to look out for one another and get involved. As the suicide wave crested and broke, the youth group, now called the One Mind Youth Movement, turned to something more political. They spent that fall as part of the local campaign against the Keystone XL pipeline, whose route would cut under the Cheyenne River just upstream from the reservation that bears its name. And after the Obama State Department denied the Keystone XL permission to cross the U.S.-Canadian border in November 2015, they moved their focus to the neighboring Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where the company Energy Transfer Partners was trying to build the Dakota Access Pipeline. That pipeline would move half a million barrels of oil a day beneath the Missouri River, the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux, which is one of the cousin bands to Cheyenne River, as well as for other downstream Sioux reservations. The youths came to believe that the Dakota pipeline was not only a threat to their drinking water but also a harbinger of the larger environmental crisis their generation was set to inherit. Over the next six months that camp grew into an improbable movement that united conservative farmers with the old radicals of the American Indian Movement; urban environmentalists with the traditional chiefs of hundreds of tribes. As Donald Trump pushes forward with the Keystone XL and Dakota Access, he will face a movement emboldened by a victory on Dec. 4, 2016, when the Department of the Army denied an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline and directed the Army Corps to consider an alternate route. It was a rare triumph for both the environmental and land rights movements, as well as for the American left in an otherwise dark moment. But little remarked upon at the time was the unlikely seed from which the movement had grown: an anti-suicide campaign among a tight-knit group of youths, most younger than 25, impelled by tragedy and guided by prophecy. At the start, the camp seemed like a quixotic undertaking. One Mind Youth made the two-hour drive north to propose setting up a prayer camp modeled on the ones raised against the Keystone XL. The tribal council agreed to set up the camp but offered little other support, pessimistic about the effort. The youths were undeterred. In early April, a handful, joined by a few former Keystone activists, moved into tepees in a protected ravine beside the Cannonball River, on the extreme north end of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Those days, the temperatures were in the 30s and there was still snow on the ground. The youths dubbed the camp Sacred Stone and lit the sacred fire. At first, they lived on little more than bologna sandwiches, potato chips and water. But then residents from the small reservation town of Cannon Ball, up the hill from Sacred Stone, began to bring donations: leftovers from dinner, cut-up wooden corrals for the campfires, a chain saw. Photo Jasilyn Charger in Washington. The previous fall, they rented a hotel room in Eagle Butte as an informal crash house for Cheyenne River youth, where sometimes as many as 20 teenagers stayed, sleeping and showering, safe from bullying or the lure of alcohol or drugs. The prayer camp at Standing Rock provided something similar. Members of One Mind would drive home every week to resupply and pick up youths who wanted to experience the camp. For Charger and other leaders, as important as the idea of the safe space was the idea that activism would teach children the skills to survive more immediate threats, like bullying and drug abuse. They hoped to pass on skills at the camp that they themselves had been taught by Keystone activists in their community. Every direct-action training against the Keystone XL, for example, referenced the prophecy of the black snake, a figure out of Lakota myth that in recent times has been identified with pipelines. The message was clear: The struggle against the pipeline was part of the same struggle against alcoholism, suicide and abuse. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After weeks at the Standing Rock camp with minimal tribal support, the young people decided that they needed to carry out some sort of public action. Bobbi Jean Three Legs, a young mother and long-distance runner from Standing Rock who had become active in the camp, had a vision. Her daughter woke her one night to ask for water, and she suddenly saw a day when, thanks to water pollution, there would be no water to give. Soon after that, she and White Eyes proposed a 500-mile relay run from the Sacred Stone Camp to Omaha to deliver a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers, asking it to deny the Dakota Access Pipeline permission to cross the Missouri River. The I.E.N. began a social-media campaign announcing the run and organized a blitz of calls and letters from tribal members on various reservations. Within days, far sooner than expected, an Army Corps representative from the Omaha district agreed to meet with members of the tribe. To some, this meant the youths could call off the run. But they insisted on going ahead. Not only did they still want support from the tribal council; they had also begun to believe that this run could bring together young people from all the Sioux reservations. One Mind saw water as an issue that could unify all Oceti Sakowin youth. And their run had rich cultural resonance: Before Europeans brought horses, long-distance messenger runners held the scattered tribes of Oceti Sakowin together. Three Legs, White Eyes and Charger mapped a route to pass through as many reservations as possible. The run would use a traditional method in which a messenger ran a short distance, about a mile, and then rested while another runner took his or her place. It allowed people who were not very good runners, like Charger, to go on a long-distance run. Daniel Grassrope, now 25, came from the Lower Brule, a band whose reservation lay down the Missouri from Cheyenne River. As a child, he dreamed of being taken away from his family and adopted by whites, something he associated, vaguely, with having his own bedroom and a mother who came to his basketball games. The run immediately gave him what Standing Rock would later give many other youths: a sense of purpose he had been lacking. It also inspired something more radical, in a way, than antipipeline activism: the belief that a group of lost people from scattered nations could still find kinship. Grassrope wrote to Three Legs immediately. On April 24, the runners set off south from the Sacred Stone Camp. They ran along the Cannonball River to Highway 1806, then down toward Cheyenne River, their first stop. Grassrope ran next to Charger, who was carrying a heavy staff that represented their ancestors. When she got too tired, Grassrope carried it. In doing so, according to Lakota belief, they were literally carrying all those who had come before. At every reservation, they met not only with tribal leaders but also with reservation youths, whom they talked to just as they had in Cheyenne River, telling them about the old ways and the camp upriver where those ways were being revived. Because the Native American community has become heavily networked on social media as a modern means to keep the bands united, word spread far beyond the communities they visited. When the youths arrived in Omaha on May 3, a representative of the Army Corps of Engineers met with them on the steps of the office. They still felt motivated as they went back to Standing Rock. Grassrope quit his job in Lower Brule and settled into the camp with them. On July 15, 30 runners set out from Sacred Stone, adding more as they made their way along their route. She was in bed asleep when Jasilyn, passing through Cheyenne River, ran into their house, threw her clothes into a bag and urged her onto their support van. Over the course of the next week or so, a dozen more joined. But on July 26, the runners learned the Army Corps of Engineers had approved the Dakota Access pipeline easements. The black snake was on its way. The runners decided to carry on to Washington, but the focus shifted back to the camp, as I.E.N. activists at Standing Rock urged people via Facebook messages to rise to the standard set by the youths. They loaded cars and buses and camper vans with donations and headed for Standing Rock. Twenty-six-year-old Eryn Wise moved to the camp in late August, at the beginning of what organizers called the big boom, when the population spiked from dozens to thousands. A native of Minneapolis, Wise was raised by her grandmother on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation after a suicide attempt at 11. On the reservation, she was picked on for excelling at school but was surrounded by her siblings, with whom she formed a close bond. But she returned to Minneapolis when she was 16 to care for her mother. When she read an article about the youth run she felt a pull and quit her job. She found her twin siblings, Alex and Lauren Howland, already at the camp. Photo Eryn Wise in Washington following the inauguration. The run, Goldtooth told me, had forced their support by transforming the Dakota Access pipeline from a regional Lakota issue into an international one. Standing Rock council members began to visit the camps and pay for emergency services, propane and portable toilets. The Council Lodge was the traditional meeting place of the Oceti Sakowin in the 19th century, when the bands would gather on the Plains. It was part of a larger move toward formalizing the prayer camps under a council government. By then, the protests against the pipeline had, for the traditional leadership, become about far more: They had become a long-prophesied end to history. Not just to its people. Many of the youths that I spoke with took this to mean the Seventh Generation had a sort of messianic role to help restore order, on behalf of all beings, to a world thrown out of balance by modernity and greed. The Seventh Generation tracks roughly with millennials of all races, but they share their own unique history. The generation between Goldtooth, 34, and Charger, now 20, is the first to have grown up free to be Indian. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

In early September, the Seven Council Fires and Chief Arvol Looking Horse, who, for the Lakota Sioux, is something like their head of religion, gave the youths a gift: a chanupa, the ceremonial pipe that is the most sacred element of the Plains religion, a symbol of the knitting together of the human community and nature, ancestors with the living. It is difficult to overstate the importance of this gesture. We said they had to be of pure mind. After the ceremony, the youths, who had begun to call themselves the International Indigenous Youth Council, or I.I.Y.C., to symbolize their desire to unite all nations behind a traditional way of life, moved together into a tepee by the Cannonball River. The I.I.Y.C. was the first experience of family for many members. She shrugged. Charger was referring to Native American history, not just what happened on the frontier but also in more recent decades. After federal campaigns reduced the Oceti Sakowin in the late 1800s, there were nearly 100 years of calculated assault as the state tried to force Native Americans to assimilate. The unified nation of Oceti Sakowin was broken into widely separated reservations, and after Congress privatized reservation land, many starving Lakota families had to sell off their property to white farmers, further cutting the size of reservations. But perhaps most devastating to their psychological health were the boarding schools, in which generations of Indians were sent to schools to be taught white culture. This system reached its nadir in the forced assimilation campaigns of the 1940s and 1950s, when the grandparents of many of the I.I.Y.C. youths were taught English literally under the lash. At Standing Rock, the youths felt they were developing the means to overcome that trauma. The key, as Charger explained it, was to let their history go, which they took as an almost holy responsibility: Forgive, and then take action to spare those who are coming in the future. For many, this provided a means to re-establish difficult relationships with parents or siblings. But it also helped bind them together into their own sort of family. In the final months of 2016, the camps at Standing Rock grew to more than 10,000, filling with indigenous peoples from hundreds of nations, climate-change activists, members of the Rainbow Family and Burning Man communities and those who simply felt a call. By that point, the role of the I.I.Y.C. had become a sort of advance guard, taking risks and pushing actions forward and winning new young converts to the cause. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Thomas Tonatiuh Lopez Jr. was one. A 24-year-old Lakota and Latino from Denver, Lopez grew up the child of AIM and Chicano activists, and as the adopted grandson of the powerful medicine man Leonard Crowdog. Once he found himself at the camp, Lopez was touched by the message of activism and reconciliation. One afternoon, he was sitting with I.I.Y.C. members, rolling cigarettes for everyone in front of a fire, as Charger talked about the role of youth. He thought about it as he drove home to Denver, and when he got there, he helped establish a local I.I.Y.C. chapter, drawing from local indigenous and Latino youths. In mid-November, the group took hundreds of Denver high-school students for a march through downtown to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline. The images of campers being maced or attacked by dogs spread anger across the country, and many brought that anger to Standing Rock. For traditional leadership, any violence was deeply concerning. Part of the matrix of prophecy that underlies their movement is the idea that should the Oceti Sakowin or their allies resort to violence, they could be wiped out. The youths took this seriously, even as they found themselves under physical threat. Wise, the camp mom, remembers, for instance, watching on Facebook Live as her sister was maced. Furious, she raced to the scene and threw herself at the police. Suddenly there were six hands on her shoulders: I.I.Y.C. members, pulling her back. She saw her brother Alex, his face white with what appeared to be war paint. But on Dec. 2, when the department posted on Facebook soliciting donations of granola bars, fruit soda and socks, the I.I.Y.C. showed up with large plastic containers filled with granola bars, warm clothing and water. The station was on lockdown; after a while, an officer looking sheepish in his helmet, faceplate and full body armor, opened the door and accepted the containers. Lopez half turned. It was a small gesture, but one that prompted thanks from the officers and anger from some in the camps. Wise remembers people asking. But prophecy was important to the youths; they worried that if the movement became too violent, it would ruin everything they had been trying to build. On Dec. 4, 2016, as thousands of military veterans from across the country crowded the camp in solidarity, the Department of the Army announced its decision to deny an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline route. The decision was a shock and an unexpected triumph. Now, with winter bearing down, he said, everyone could begin to go home. For them, leaving was more complicated. There was also a more personal problem. Many of them had nowhere else to go. They had become dependent on the I.I.Y.C. for a support network and a place to live. Over their months spent in close quarters, the members of the youth council had bound themselves together not only as friends but as family. The stakes of dissolving the group had become obvious in a more immediate way, too: One of the youth runners had already attempted suicide and been rushed to the hospital in Bismarck. Advertisement Continue reading the main story As the camps emptied out, though, there were not enough resources for everyone to stay, and most of the young people dispersed for the winter, leaving behind a skeleton crew of 10. Wise went home to Minneapolis to begin a job as an organizer for Honor the Earth, an indigenous environmental activist group. Grassrope went back to Lower Brule. Charger was couch-surfing with friends in Eagle Butte. But the I.I.Y.C. were in the process of setting up a 501(c)(3), a nonprofit organization that would allow them to establish some formal order to what had been an ad hoc group. And in January, after a month apart, the I.I.Y.C. youths reunited in Washington for the mass protests against Donald Trump. They were still in Washington when the news came that he had signed executive orders allowing the Dakota Access and Keystone pipelines to proceed. After that, Jasilyn Charger made the trip back to Standing Rock. She planned to spend a couple of days there before heading south to Eagle Butte, where she would organize against the Keystone. He offered a practical reason as well: In December, back home in Denver, he got a call from a young person on the verge of suicide.

The thousands of people that have arrived in support of the Standing Rock Sioux against the Dakota Access oil pipeline are still sleeping soundly, dreams dancing with victory. The sacred fire is still alive after a night of ceremony and celebration in temperatures well below zero. For a day that many thought might never come has arrived: the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has denied the easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross the Missouri River at Lake Oahe, and ordered a full Environmental Impact Statement. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had chosen today as the deadline for the Standing Rock Sioux Lakota and allies to abandon their resistance camps. Governor Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota had echoed the call with an immediate evacuation order. They declared those that remain will be considered trespassers, and face arrest on their own ancestral lands. Having faced deceit from the U.S. government for hundreds of years, Native leaders are cautious in their celebration. Never trust these crooks we have already seen what they will do to our people. Make them accountable, we need everyone on the ground until every pipe is removed. Allard is a co-founder of the Sacred Stone Camp, located on her land along the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline route. With more than 200 tribes present, now in multiple camps, this is the largest gathering of nations in a century. They are keeping prayerful water protesters from this and other sacred burial sites with razor wire, sound cannons, water hoses, rubber bullets and attack dogs. The evacuation orders from the Army Corps and Governor still stand, despite the temporary respite for the Missouri River and the Standing Rock Sioux people. We know how to live in winter. The 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty designates the currently disputed land as territory of the Standing Rock Sioux nation, though it was later illegally taken into federal control for dam construction by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1948. The easement that was denied yesterday means that Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the Dakota Access Pipeline, will face significant fines if they continue to bore beneath Lake Oahe on this disputed territory. The majority of the 1,178 mile pipeline has already been built, stretching from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to terminals in Illinois. Barclays, HSBC and the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) all have had dealings with the company and its subsidiaries. The connections between European colonisation of the Americas and the struggle at Standing Rock were drawn out further in five UK actions on 1 December, the first day of a month of global solidarity actions. And it is this history that brings me to speak to you today. Genocide and colonisation is still taking place in different forms. The financial institutions of the UK are partners in funding the Dakota Access Pipeline. With your money these banks are complicit in the same old methods of ignoring and harming the indigenous people. Following the action, two RBS employees followed organisers to a nearby cafe. RBS provided financial support to the parent company of Dakota Access LLC but exited the relationship a year ago. While welcoming the news, activists demanded that the bank make a public commitment to funding no further fossil fuel infrastructure. Also on 1 December, activists gathered in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux at the Radcliffe Camera in Oxford, at Barclays Bank in Bristol and in Parliament Square in London. Some supporters also chose to sit in meditation for the 45 minutes before the action, in temperatures two degrees above freezing. This dedication to prayer, honouring of the ancestors and ceremonial action echoes what has been called for by elders and organisers at Standing Rock. We stand by our rights to self-determination and justice. We stand by our territorial treaty rights. So I say, don't panic relatives, we got this. Hard times may be ahead, but we got this.

Overzealous law enforcement officials in North Dakota have jailed journalists and celebrities who were exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech and the press by documenting police attacks on protesters.

The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of over 200 other tribes from across the Americas are leading the resistance to protect sovereign land and drinking water from destruction by the fossil fuel industry. However, in an attempt to quell these historic nonviolent protests, Gov. Dalrymple ordered a state of emergency that has militarized the police force, set up a highway roadblock and mobilized the National Guard to intimidate protesters.

Young challenged those at MIT to partner with Sioux tribes, and that resulted in follow-up meetings, a visit to Standing Rock for the first Oceti Sakowin Energy Summit, and ultimately the fellowship. So it could very likely result in investment or grant dollars. The fellowship is far from the only clean energy win for Native American communities in the Midwest. The six tribes of the Sioux Nation of North and South Dakota have also formed an independent, nonprofit, governmental entity called the Oceti Sakowin Power Authority to jointly develop tribal renewable energy resources. The consortium is working toward developing an immense wind farm, and has landed philanthropic support from the Clinton Global Initiative, Rockefeller Philanthropic Advisors, the Bush Foundation, and the Northwest Area Foundation.

Because of the violence of police, one young woman may lose her arm, and another could be blinded for life, and that's only so far. Law enforcement is picking up on reports that have circulated among some leftists on social media. But the complaints are overblown, based on my own experience, having traveled to Standing Rock twice to stand in solidarity. There has been an influx of tens of thousands of people to Standing Rock over the past several months, and especially during the Thanksgiving holiday period at the end of November. Those who come to Standing Rock aren't unwelcome intruders--they are responding directly to calls from the water protectors to mobilize support. Police crack down on peaceful water protectors with rubber bullets and pepper spray (Red Warrior Camp) The influx has created new logistical problems for the encampments, which should be expected when thousands of people arrive anywhere. The Oceti Sakowin have responded by organizing daily orientation meetings that introduce newcomers, Native and non-Native alike, to Lakota culture and protocols. We can expect that there will be a learning curve for people meeting each other for the first time in solidarity, and that some will be unable or unwilling to abide. But we are talking about a very small subset of people who have acted disrespectfully, violating the prohibitions against drugs, alcohol or weapons in a prayer camp. They, in fact, face the consequences now of being ignored by tribal leaders and water protectors who will not allow their actions to be a distraction from the struggle. Last month, some 500 clergy came to the camp, and on December 4, more than 2,000 military veterans are self-deploying. There is far too much work to be done. This story is actually insulting in its suggestion that sovereign Native Nations aren't capable of democratic organization or leadership, or are so fragile in the face of cultural differences that they can be overwhelmed by a small group of people belonging to an even smaller subculture. ONE REASON why the police are suddenly concerned about the welfare of the camps when they're threatened by hippies is because they hope to set water protectors and supporters against each other. Mostly, the Morton County sheriffs, the National Guard and private security forces working for Energy Transfer Partners have been content to employ brute force: dogs, rubber bullets, water cannons in sub-zero conditions, concussion grenades and more used against peaceful protectors. The level of human rights violations committed by the state of North Dakota on behalf of a private corporation is appalling. It has attracted the attention of groups like Amnesty International and the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, which sent teams to witness and report on abuses. Consider Sophia Wilansky, a 21-year-old from New York City who was acting as a medic when her arm was blown to pieces by a direct hit from a concussion grenade on the night police attacked at Backwater Bridge. Or Vanessa Dundon, who on the same night was hit in the face with a rubber bullet and may be blind for the rest of her life as a result. The idea that the police are there to protect protesters or uphold the rights of Native American people is farcical--yet it has picked up momentum, particularly in the local media. Water protectors are frequently described by North Dakota news outlets as violent rioters impeding the progress of jobs and energy self-sufficiency. Some local residents and officials have gone so far as to start labeling protesters as terrorists--as if being armed with drums and prayers comes anywhere near the militarized equipment deployed against them by the state of North Dakota. To millions across the country, these depictions are obviously racist and rooted in centuries-old colonial stereotypes about restless and backward savages. The net effect will be to impede solidarity. It is beneficial to the state of North Dakota to have potential supporters guilted out of providing solidarity when the Oceti Sakowin are directly asking people for just that. This is especially with the looming threat of eviction and evacuation from Gov. Jack Dalrymple in the middle of a North Dakota blizzard.

He typically works until midnight or 1am, then wakes up at 5am to eat, read newspapers and check the television, he said. And amid signs he began his presidency with the same chaotic operation that marked his campaign, a report has claimed he was not even aware he was elevating Steve Bannon to a senior security post when he signed one of several executive orders. This was reportedly done following the backlash over the haphazard and chaotic rollout of the order halting the refugee programme and suspending travel for people from seven Middle Eastern and North African countries. It said Mr Trump would be looped in on the drafting of orders much earlier in the process. Remarkably, the report says, Mr Trump was not fully briefed on details of the order he signed giving his chief strategist, Mr Bannon, a seat on the National Security Council.

Visibility is low; however, roads are passable with four wheel drive vehicles. As of 2:00PM CST, there have been no confirmed deaths or any critical care patients.

We have developed the capacity to keep the campers safe and warm, but are asking the state of North Dakota to cease its inhumane and unjustifiable blockade of highway 1806. We applaud the water protectors efforts to self-organize and care for each other, the medics & healers who have collectively held space here for months, the Standing Rock EMS for their coordination and expert care of patients, and all other groups working tirelessly to ensure the health and safety of the campers.

First and foremost, this is a struggle that has made the shape and function of colonialism quite clear. Our society can no longer pretend that the atrocities against us have ended, and with that knowledge comes a renewed accountability. These events should also reinforce to everyone the realities of state violence, in all its forms. Native people are killed at a higher rate by police than any other group in the United States. As we have witnessed with police attacks on the movement for Black lives, structural violence is cyclical. It is a remix of old atrocities and abuses. It is the character of law enforcement, born of slave patrols and Indian Constables, on full display, and we must not pretend otherwise. The Army Corps and Obama have repeatedly invoked politicized language of empathy and concern. While our people have converged in peace, police from around the midwest have also converged, to play their role in this moment of colonial and anti-colonial struggle. produce is to further repress us. and retold.

The state of North Dakota issued an emergency evacuation last week for the main camp, formerly known as Oceti Sakowin, that goes into effect today. While the Governor says this evacuation is for the safety of the people and the river, we know better than to believe these claims. Ironically, the Governor also voiced his concerns about flooding and how this puts people at risk. Flooding is happening sooner than anyone anticipated due to warmer-than-normal temperatures. This is why the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, The Indigenous Environmental Network and Native Organizers Alliance among many others have called for Native Nations Rising: Rise with Standing Rock on March 10 in Washington D.C. Our mission is to carry the momentum Standing Rock started to other Indigenous communities and to focus not just on the rights of one tribe but of all Native Nations. March with us. Rise with Native Nations. Click here to sign up and learn more. As another transition takes place for the camps and for this movement, it seems like a good opportunity to reflect on how and why this movement began, what we learned, and where we are going next. Three Lessons from Standing Rock 1. We Need to Work Together This movement taught us that we need to work together, that it no longer works to organize or work in silos as if our issues are separate. Respecting Indigenous rights means climate justice, self-determination for Indigenous Peoples means water systems and ecosystems will be protected for generations, and respecting treaties goes go hand in hand with respecting the rights of Black and Brown people across this nation. 2. We Are Powerful We also learned or we were reminded that collectively we can change history. One tactic of colonization that has been used to eliminate our existence is erasure. Excluding our narratives from history books, media, you name it. With Standing Rock and with the sustained support from our allies, the Indigenous voice became apart of mainstream news and media. Because of this, millions of people, not just in America but across the world, can never unknow what they know now. Together we broke the pattern of erasure. On this day, and since the beginning, standing for the water: Joye Braun, Tania Aubid, Ladonna Allard. Photo by: Toni Cervantes 3. Indigenous People Must Lead Finally, we learned that Indigenous Peoples must lead environmental, climate, and political movements. Indigenous Peoples have an inherent connection to how to live in harmony and in reciprocity with the Earth, unlike the colonized mind that is taught to extract and commodify the resources we have been offered. In doing so they also called attention to the appalling racism and colonization that is still alive in America. The Dakota Access pipeline was originally proposed to go through Bismarck, a predominantly White community. After locals pushed back on the pipeline for fear that it would poison their water system, the pipeline was rerouted through tribal land without proper consultation with the Standing Rock Sioux Nation or their consent. In response to this injustice, the youth began a spirit camp on the land that would become known as Oceti Sakowin. Their courage and determination sparked a unified Indigenous-led movement that not only fulfilled ancient prophecies but also elevated and centered Indigenous issues that go beyond Dakota Access. After months of lawsuits and global mobilizations pressuring President Obama and the Army Corps of Engineers, it was announced that the project would undergo an environmental review. Under federal law, pipelines are eligible for a fast-tracked permitting process, which is how Dakota Access bypassed more rigorous environmental and public review. They plan to continue to use all legal avenues available even if oil starts flowing. People are withdrawing their individual accounts and more Divest Your City campaigns are popping up every day. While the ultimate fate of the legal challenges is unknown, with Trump in office, there is reason to believe that oil could soon flow through Dakota Access and under the Missouri River in a matter of months. Yet, despite what we are up against, because of what Standing Rock has taught us, I feel strong, and I know that our collective resistance, if sustained, will have a long term impact on stopping the fossil fuel industry. From the Trans-Pecos Pipeline in Texas to the Bayou Bridge Pipeline in the Gulf and up to the Line 3 and Line 5 Pipelines in the Great Lakes region, there are numerous places where we can continue to put pressure on the Fossil Fuel Industry and demand that Indigenous Rights and climate science be honored.

In preparation, we've been helping plan the next international day of action targeting banks to divest from the dangerous project. Today, Bank DNB announced it is going to sell its assets in the Dakota Access Pipeline project. Original petition text: Over 100 water protectors were brutally arrested by Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) security forces -- some locked in dog kennels and shot at with rubber bullets and pepper spray -- just for standing up for their ancestral lands and our most precious resource, water. Thousands have peacefully gathered in person and in solidarity to stop this 570,000 barrel-per-day pipeline that would endanger the water and ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. And while this inspiring work is going on, the banks that we use every day are backing the project with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and investment each. Demand your bank to stop financially supporting from the Dakota Access Pipeline and associated projects such as Energy Transfer now. North Dakota recorded nearly 300 oil pipeline spills in less than two years -- and none were disclosed to the public. The DAPL was originally going to be routed near the city of Bismarck -- but was rejected because it would have run so close to municipal water sources. Bank DNB, BBVA, TD, Wells Fargo, Mizuho Bank, BayernLB, Citibank, ING, Deutsche Bank, RBC, Credit Suisse, UBS, Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole, Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, and ABN Amro Capital all support the project financially. These banks are vulnerable to public pressure. We are their customers and shareholders -- and they need our business. Stop the money, stop a pipeline. Tell your bank to stop funding the project now. What we are bearing witness to at Standing Rock is a moment of history. We can't all be in North Dakota, but we can all stand in solidarity with those who are. Which is why after you sign the petition, we will list other ways you can support to help the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. This community is powerful when it comes together. Now, we need to come together now and help the Standing Rock Sioux stop the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Wells Fargo has drawn criticism for its central role in raising funds for the pipeline's construction. But banks aren't the only Bay Area institutions that stand to profit if the pipeline is completed. ETP and Sunoco are the companies building the Dakota pipeline. Results have been slow and mixed. In 2015, CalPERS began divesting from thermal coal. Gov. Jerry Brown later signed a bill requiring both CalPERS and CalSTRS to sell off coal stocks and bonds by July 2017. Last September, the UC announced it was divesting from companies that mine coal and oil sands, two of the dirtiest fossil fuels. But the UC and both state pension funds remain heavily invested in oil and gas. The UC and CalPERS didn't respond to requests to discuss these investments. Pennie Opal Plant, one of the founders of Idle No More SF Bay, called the pension system's engagement policies crazy. Hugh MacMillan of Food and Water Watch has researched the Dakota Access Pipeline's finances. According to MacMillan, the fact that all three are invested in Energy Transfer Partners' corporate bonds, as opposed to stock, matters, as well. According to MacMillan, the bonds are used to finance Energy Transfer Partners ongoing operations and to help build expensive capital projects such as the Dakota Access Pipeline. Opal Plant said that indigenous peoples and their supporters will continue to fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline and similar projects, and that focusing on local companies and investors who are funding the pipeline will remain part of their strategy.

Revealed: FBI terrorism taskforce investigating Standing Rock activists Read more The growing group of military veterans could make it harder for police and government officials to try to remove hundreds of activists who remain camped near the construction site and, some hope, could limit use of excessive force by law enforcement during demonstrations. It is unclear how many vets may arrive to Standing Rock; some organizers estimate a few dozen are on their way, while other activists are pledging that hundreds could show up in the coming weeks. An estimated 1,000 veterans traveled to Standing Rock in December just as the Obama administration announced it was denying a key permit for the oil company, a huge victory for the tribe.

Vets with post-traumatic stress disorder also suffered in the cold and chaotic environment without proper support, said Matthew Crane, a US navy veteran who is helping coordinate a return group with the organization VeteransRespond. On Friday afternoon, as snow rapidly melted during an unusually warm day in Cannon Ball, Jake Pogue helped organize a vets camp area at Sacred Stone, the first camp that emerged last spring in opposition to the pipeline. Since last fall, police have made roughly 700 arrests, at times deploying water cannons, Mace, rubber bullets, teargas, pepper spray and other less-than-lethal weapons. Private guards for the pipeline have also been accused of violent tactics. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, founder of the Sacred Stone camp and a Standing Rock tribe member, said she welcomed the return of the vets. At Standing Rock, indigenous activists say the mass arrests and police violence have led many of them to develop PTSD, suffering symptoms that many veterans understand well.

Published by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis and the Sightline Institute, it spotlights a potential economic weakness of the project: the January 1 deadline by which Energy Transfer Partners had promised oil companies it would have completed construction. Missing the January 1 deadline opens up the possibility the pipeline company may lose its contracts with oil companies. This is viewer supported news. Please do your part today. Michael Vendiola a member of the Swinomish Indian tribal community. Copy may not be in its final form. We refuse to be silent community members in your decision to support the destructive fossil fuel economy, in general, and the Dakota Access pipeline, in particular. It spotlights a potential economic weakness of the project: the January 1st deadline by which Energy Transfer Partners had promised oil companies it would have completed construction. Missing the January 1st deadline opens up the possibility the pipeline company may lose its contracts with oil companies. It kept rising and rising. And all the forecasts said that oil prices were going to remain high and that oil production in North Dakota was going to remain robust. But almost as soon as the companies signed up its first set of shippers, the first commitments from oil companies to ship through the pipeline, you started to see oil markets collapse. And as that happened, oil companies in North Dakota started to pull back. A lot of them were starting to lose money from some of their oil projects in the Bakken region in North Dakota. And so, what you started to see is a decline in production. There have already been a bunch of pipelines built and approved. The extra capacity of the Dakota Access pipeline just may not be necessary. And that poses a real risk for the company. The company really depends on those contracts. You can actually imagine that some of the oil shippers might be thinking, well, you know, with production down, with prices down, maybe this would be a great time to pull back from our commitments to the pipeline. And, in fact, I think the investors in those companies should be encouraging the oil shippers to pull back, to take a second look and to think about whether it makes sense for the long run. AMY GOODMAN: Michael Vendiola, you were one of the organizers of the Wells Fargo protest on Saturday. On Sunday, the decision came down by the Obama administration, the Army Corps of Engineers, to deny the easement under the Missouri. MICHAEL VENDIOLA: Sure. So, this is just another so-called agreement that is put forth, which could be turned over as soon as another president comes in. MICHAEL VENDIOLA: Yes, our action this past Saturday was against Wells Fargo. We have a list of 17 banks that are investors within the Energy Transfer Partnerships and putting the Dakota Access pipeline together. MICHAEL VENDIOLA: Right. You know, that looks to be the West Coast version of DAPL. And really, we were working on providing testimony. Michael Vendiola, thank you for joining us.

It was a shock to each of us to learn, on the morning of December 12th, just before the start of the second day of invite only private dialogue, that the Chair of the Morton County Commission, Cody Schulz had also been in Olso, Norway for the Forum. Unbeknownst to any of us, Mr. Schulz was among the other five hundred ticketed guests for the first day of High Level Dialogue where Ms. Lafferty and other notable indigenous panelists spoke. Apparently, Ms. Smith had reassured Ms. Torry this was acceptable to us when, in fact, Ms. Smith had not consulted with any of us prior to our arrival in Oslo. What Ms. Smith had hoped for anyone to gain from such a setup is beyond my comprehension. Had I known in advance that her intention was to force such an inappropriate dialogue, I would have declined the invitation, as it puts me in a vulnerable and potentially dangerous position legally and emotionally. I still have pending charges in Morton County after being arrested while in prayer, as well as active daily trauma that is a direct result of the inhumane actions of Morton County. With over 300 criminal cases still pending, these violations are on-going. We sent a letter to the Nobel Institute documenting our concerns on December 13, 2017. In no way do we wish for the important dialogue highlighted at the Forum in Oslo to be tainted by this misstep. We hope to have the ongoing support of the Nobel Institute as we continue to strengthen our connections with other indigenous communities and nation states, and with our allies around the world who understand that our rights to protect our aboriginal homelands and sacred sites and to preserve our languages and cultures, are, like our responsibility to protect water as the source of all life, issues of global significance. Angela Bibens, Esq. Chief Arvol Looking Horse Responds To Whom It May Concern, I would like to state that I am very disappointed to learn of how my friends and relatives were treated in Oslo, Norway. My understanding was that there was going to be dialogue concerning Sacred Sites and a panel discussion on human rights. Stephanie Hope Smith had encouraged me to attend this conference, but I had already committed myself to other obligations. Upon return of the delegation it was brought to my attention that the Chair of the Morton County Commission, Cody Schultz, had been invited by Stephanie to attend this conference. This uncomfortable situation has jeopardized the reputation and safety of my friends and relatives that attended, as well as myself. I was not made aware of the plans for any kind of panel discussion involving political figures, which has now been publicized in American media. The media has portrayed the situation to look as if this meeting in Oslo had been planned with all parties in agreement and with prior knowledge, when that was not the case. I have been informed by the delegates that they were taken by surprise at the announcement of his presence. The situation was addressed and Cody Schultz was excluded from any interaction or dialogue with the delegates. I am very disappointed that the event was not what I been informed it would be. Sacred Sites and Human Rights are the focus of my peace work. I am a spiritual leader, I am not a political person to be in agreement with any government official in creating discussion about any issue that pertains to Standing Rock. On 11 December the Nobel Peace Prize Forum Oslo convenes a high-level internationally broadcast two-hour discussion. The Forum brings together a unique constellation of Nobel Peace Prize Laureates and other thought leaders; representatives of governments and international organizations; scholars; international civil society leaders and activists, including those building peace in fragile, conflict and post-conflict situations, business and private sector actors; journalists; and youth across the globe, including students. The discussion will focus on two recent examples of intrastate conflict involving indigenous peoples over energy and environmental resources. More specifically, the speakers will discuss and compare the Standing Rock conflict, which led to war-zone like conditions within the United States from September 2016 to February 2017, and a somewhat similar conflict between the indigenous Sami population in Arctic Norway and the Norwegian state. Both the Dakota tribe and the Sami people will be represented on the panel. We expect an audience of up to 500 people with a variety of backgrounds. The Forum will be broadcast live by NRK, the leading Norwegian radio and TV network, and possibly by another leading international news network. The Forum will be streamed live by Nobel Media, the global digital outreach unit of the Nobel Foundation, and made accessible across the world on YouTube. We also expect extensive coverage by international news media, present in Oslo to cover the Nobel Peace Prize Award Ceremony on 10 December."}, {"URL": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/standing-rock-general-custer-relative-visits-dakota-access-pipeline", "Timestamp": "20180919000846", "Sentences": "On the same day the US government granted permission for the Dakota Access pipeline to drill under the Missouri river, a descendant of General George Armstrong Custer had arrived at Standing Rock.

Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of CREDO activists who stood with our indigenous and climate movement allies in North Dakota, we temporarily blocked construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, but our fight to stop the pipeline once and for all is not yet over. But we have the collective financial power as consumers and account holders to stop the pipeline. We must call on these banks to divest from this massive project immediately before Trump can approve the construction of the pipeline. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline. As of Jan. 1, ETP has effectively failed to meet its contractual obligations to deliver oil through the Dakota Access pipeline. Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline. By staying invested in these projects, these 17 banks are tacitly waging a coordinated campaign to destroy sacred Native lands and silence peaceful protest. This could be our last shot at stopping the Dakota Access pipeline before Donald Trump takes office on January 20.

There, new pictures of the climate fight have emerged, showing communal kitchens, fields of tents and armed guards, hired by the fossil fuel industry, facing off with praying grandmothers. Jade Begay has been stationed in Standing Rock for the last month with the Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN). High winds had sent smoke down the flume of the stove heating her yurt the night before, resulting in a lengthy troubleshooting period and more than a few lost hours of sleep. Resistance against it will continue. And because, as anyone at Standing Rock can tell you, the fight against the pipeline has always been about much more than one piece of infrastructure. At its core has been a centuries-long battle for indigenous sovereignty and an effort to preserve the earth for generations to come. Fight beyond Standing Rock A week ago Sunday, the U.S. Army denied a permit necessary for Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) to complete a crucial part of the pipeline. The next morning a harsh blizzard set in, and Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault asked those camped out along the banks of the Cannonball River to return home. As ETP seeks a speedy green light from the courts, one possible path forward for the pipeline is a reroute, diverting the remaining route away from sacred Sioux sites. We have that ability. North Dakota residents know all too well that energy markets look quite a bit different than they did when the project was first proposed in 2014, at the height of the Bakken shale boom. If the companies are unable to use the pipeline, they could opt to drop their investments in it altogether. Several demonstrations have been held at banks around the country that invested in the pipeline, including giants like Wells Fargo and TD Bank. Long history of struggle While the campaign against the Dakota Access Pipeline continues, there are other long-standing concerns facing the Sioux and indigenous communities around the country. The so-called sacrifice zones pipelines tend to get constructed over are as economic as they are environmental, and delinking the two can be virtually impossible. As of 2014, 43 percent of Standing Rock Sioux reservation residents lived below the poverty line, joining one in four Native Americans throughout the United States. An estimated 32 percent of homes in the Navajo Nation lack electricity; thirty-eight percent lack basic water services. Incarceration rates are similarly unequal; Native men are incarcerated at four times the rate of their white counterparts. Native Americans are also more likely to be killed be police than any other racial group. Despite being a frequent target of regressive policies, Native voices can be hard to find in left organizing spaces. LeBlanc, a member of the Caddo Nation, is a longtime organizer and the director of Native Organizers Alliance (NOA). According to LeBlanc, many of the elders at the Standing Rock encampments were active in these and other struggles, with several having been members of the American Indian Movement (AIM). In other words, many of the leading water protectors in the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline are seasoned organizers, some holding three and four decades of experience in social movements. Neither it is an abstract or radical point to say that a pipeline that spills oil into the Missouri River is a severe danger not just to the Sioux but to the many thousands of people downstream, like climate change itself. And like its leadership structures, the politics behind it are even more finely tuned. Trump recently named ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his top pick to become Secretary of State. If confirmed, Tillerson could hold the final call over border-crossing pipelines like the Keystone XL. The President-elect has also named Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, as his choice to head the Department of Energy. They came out of a militancy around the Fight for 15, Black Lives Matter, Occupy Wall Street. Facing Trump and Tillerson, those movements will need to be stronger than ever.

Maybe some day. The alternatives are becoming more economical but are not there yet in terms of replacing a major amount of fossil fuel energy. The pipeline will be built, not because you are right or wrong, but because that is what will happen. Posted by Bob Fritz on 2016-12-20 15:30:20 You don't know what is happening at Standing Rock. The pipeline will not be built there. The will of the people is just too great. There is also a good chance that the pipeline will never be used. That is their fault for continuing to invest in an energy source that we must stop using ASAP. The cost of using the pipeline will far outweigh any benefits, except for the fossil fuel monopoly, of course. Alternatives are most certainly cheaper than fossil fuels. They are technology disruptors that the fossil fuel monopoly cannot compete against. You cannot prove otherwise. ruling, so there will be no penalty. President Trump will void the current ruling. The investors will rfeturn because they have already spent most of the money to build the portion already built. The January 1 deadline will nave no effect. If the pipeline were to be permanently halted, rail transport would be used. Rail is more expensive and has more spills. Spills harm the environment. Personally I think the Indians know this and are holding out for getting some more cash. The environmentalists probably don't know it (in my opinion). If they were smart and were really concerned about having a clean environment, they would not oppose this pipeline or the Keystone one. They have a Jan 1 deadline, or investors start to pull out, and the pipeline gets shelved. A completed pipeline, jail for those who break the law, lower energy prices, and less pollution risk than shipping oil by rail. In reality, this temporary halt will probably be reversed in a few months. The goal at Standing Rock was limited to moving the pipeline route not shutting it down. The protests never got out any message about stopping the use of gasoline powered personal transportation and limiting profits on gas buying which is the only way any real changes will be made in relation to pipelines..Also, comparing Standing Rock to Occupy Wall Street is strange since many OWS activists and livestreamers were the first to go there and helped promote the Standing Rock protests on social media. I see both alternative and mainstream press headlines saying this is a victory when in fact what happened at a very high cost may be only temporary lasting a few months. Once again people who do not want pipelines but continue to buy gas for personal transport are being hypocritical and need to consider their own lifestyles if they really want change."}, {"URL": "https://trofire.com/2017/02/16/sioux-nation-tribal-leaders-hold-presser-dc-dapl-news-ed/", "Timestamp": "20180919002901", "Sentences": "Ed Schultz is an American television and radio host, a liberal political commentator, and a former sports broadcaster.

On Sunday, December 4, 2016 the Army Corp of Engineers denied the easement for pipeline development under Lake Oahe and made recommendations for an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on the river crossing and exploration for alternative routes. 2. Energy Transfer Partners vows to continue building DAPL under Lake Oahe. In spite of recent snow storms ETP has continued construction. 3. Fracking continues in the Bakken. The Bakken Shale holds an estimated 5 billion barrels of oil, and is producing approximately 900,000 barrels per day. Fracked crude oil is hauled by rail with trains that can haul up to 70,000 barrels. North Dakota officials approved 3 additional pipeline projects in August, 2016. 4.

Red Fawn was arrested with more than 140 people when police attacked the 1851 Treaty Camp at Standing Rock on October 27, 2016. She remains in jail to this date. 7. Lawsuits are being filed addressing excessive force and police brutality. 8. Indigenous peoples have no guaranteed protection for religious freedom. Sacred sites are subject to discretion of public land management agencies when assessing threats to sacred sites. Infrastructure, resource, and other interests currently threaten sacred lands throughout the so-called US such as South Mountain, Red Butte, Oak Flat, Mt. Taylor, Chaco Canyon, Bears Ears, and many more sacred sites. 9. Colonialism and Capitalism. The legacy of colonial invasion and occupation of Indigenous lands is one of genocide and ecocide. So long as Mother Earth is viewed as a commodity, sacred lands will be threatened by resource extraction industries. Upholding Indigenous sovereignty means engaging in anti-colonial and anti-capitalist struggle to ensure the systems that benefit from destruction of Mother Earth and water are abolished.

Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of CREDO activists who stood with our indigenous and climate movement allies in North Dakota, we temporarily blocked construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, but our fight to stop the pipeline once and for all is not yet over. But we have the collective financial power as consumers and account holders to stop the pipeline. We must call on these banks to divest from this massive project immediately before Trump can approve the construction of the pipeline. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline. As of Jan. 1, ETP has effectively failed to meet its contractual obligations to deliver oil through the Dakota Access pipeline. Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline. By staying invested in these projects, these 17 banks are tacitly waging a coordinated campaign to destroy sacred Native lands and silence peaceful protest. This could be our last shot at stopping the Dakota Access pipeline before Donald Trump takes office on January 20. We stood with the water protectors and our allies in the climate justice movement to put a halt to the pipeline once before, and we must stand with them again to shut this project down for good.

No one was arrested that weekend. No one. But the folliwing weekend it started up again with arrests. Yup. Kinder Morgan knew this was an untenable situation because they knew about unceded lands. Justin Trudeau knows this well but chooses to competely ignore unceded rights. Arrogant to the point of not wanting to be told by the Supreme Court of Canada that he has no jurisdiction on land that does not belong to the Canadian Confederation. He knows that jurisdiction is with First Nations all the way. Rule of law is meaningful consultation. But this could be very interesting because your leaders have made agreements with kinder Morgan.

There are currently two full-time encampments in North Florida, and the possibility of more to emerge along the route with your support and participation. You are invited to help build opposition on the ground to this fracked gas pipeline. As the camps at Standing Rock in North Dakota are asking people to stop coming for the time being, this struggle here is beginning to escalate. Camps are prepared to accommodate an immediate increase in participation, and weather conditions are very mild here. Its still warm enough to swim in the water we are protecting. These links provide details and directions to the STR camps: Water Is Life Camp (near Branford) Sacred Water Camp (near Live Oak) The following dates are offered as moments of focused escalation to those who can only come for a limited time. Background Lines have been drawn. The pipeline pushers can see that their days are numbered. But there are many major wetland and river crossings for this pipeline, and these horizontal directional drilling (HDD) operations that are very intensive to complete. The drilling sites offer a choke point to stop their progress and provide a dramatic illustration of the threat posed by piercing into the aquifer to transport such a hazardous substance. HDD drill rig boring into the wetlands surrounding the Santa Fe River. So, while they are working fast across the route, the Santa Fe River crossing, for example, was supposed to be complete over a month ago and has been stalled by still-unknown technical challenges. Mapping a path to victory: Remembering the Defeat of the Cross Barge Canal In 1935, an infrastructure project was initiated in North Florida that would significantly dwarfed the Panama and Suez canals. The military and economic impact was expected to be massive. It was officially cancelled in 1991. In 1998, the right-of-way was turned over to the state and became the Marjorie Harris Carr Cross Florida Greenway, named in honor of Carr, who had led opposition to the canal. It can be done again. We are fighting this pipeline today to stop gas from ever flowing through it. While its painful to see the immediate impacts to thousands of acres of forests, farms and communities caused by the initial construction, we must keep our eyes on the ultimate goal of cancelling this project before it can go online. That means sustained, strategic action that slows down construction, drives up their costs and raises the profile of the issue up to national and international attention. This could send the project back to the drawing board for violations of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). These victories, whether through presidential orders or legal challenges, are often hashed out in the court of public opinion before a favorable decision comes down from a judge, agency or political body. That means keeping the issue in the headlines, and forcing engagement between the opposition, the companies, and as wide an array of government agencies as possible, as often as possible. The Bigger Victory: Decolonization The southern portion of this pipeline project cuts into unceded territory of Seminole and Miccosukee people who fought and won, establishing an agreement with President Polk in 1845 that declared the southwestern portion of Florida was reserved to their people. There is a community of independent indigenous people who have retained their rights by refusing federal recognition as tribal members to this day. Thanks to the dedication of warriors and protectors from Standing Rock and the hundreds of other indigenous tribes and communities who gathered to challenge DAPL in North Dakota, we can no longer talk about oil and gas pipelines without also talking about the ongoing genocide of native people that they represent. Turning the tide on the fossil fuel era and dismantling the energy empire that is killing the planet begins with decolonizing our own minds and declaring solidarity with those who have stood in defiance of this Manifest Destiny mindset for over 500 years.

Surging waves pushed our nose straight up toward the sky. My dad braced his foot against mine. The bow of the Swissaloh crashed into a trough between waves as we pulled through the Salish waters in unison. Within minutes, the turbulence was behind us. But today and into the future, the radical potential embodied in our presence on waters and lands stolen from us by armed settlers abides. In the 1960s and 1970s, Coast Salish nations, whose canoes long navigated these seas, used the 1854 Medicine Creek Treaty to reassert their inherent and treaty rights to fish across ancestral territories. We could have stopped that ship. But our indigenous moment of action was not yet at hand. Ya hey ya ho, hey ya ho. The View From Standing Rock On October 27, police clad in riot gear sweep through a camp of indigenous water protectors along the banks of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers, just north of the present-day boundary of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. A group of water protectors gather in prayer along the banks of the Cannonball River. Police descend a hill to the riverbank, and unleash clouds of pepper spray and a hail of rubber bullets and beanbag rounds. Unarmed protectors hold hands. Thirty yards up the road, two columns of over one hundred law enforcement officers flanked by armored personnel carriers, Humvees, and a high-frequency sound cannon assemble in attack formation. Hundreds of miles around, stretching across present-day South Dakota, Nebraska, and Wyoming, lies the territory of the Oceti Sakowin, or Great Sioux Nation, guaranteed to the Lakota, Nakota, and Dakota people under the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty. The police, batons drawn, march lockstep toward the protesters. The next evening, the cowboys are gloating. They have rounded up 139 protesters. Engaging in a riot, plus conspiracy to endanger by fire and explosion. North Dakota governor Jack Dalrymple declares that the police have successfully cleared out the camp. He says nothing about treaty lands legally claimed and defended by a sovereign indigenous nation. The Indians refuse to recede. Felony charges are later dropped. With each show of police force, more protectors pour into camps already more than five thousand strong. Within weeks, the largest bank in Norway pulls its assets from the project. Pundits call on President Barack Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to speak out against the pipeline. The New York Times editorial board insists that the pipeline be rerouted. The cowboys may have outgunned the unarmed Indians, but they are being outwitted, outflanked, and out-strategized by a massive, transnational, indigenous-led movement. Facebook Live is their primary media channel, but stories about the water protectors are jumping across the divide from social to mainstream media, appearing in the New York Times and on CNN and Saturday Night Live. Support is growing. Indians are broadening the frontier of political possibility. The Dance With the State The next day, the standoff resumes. But this time, law enforcement faces dozens of indigenous women moving to the healing rhythms of the jingle dress dance. According to oral traditions from the Mille Lacs and Whitefish Bay Ojibwe, a father dreamed the dance would cure his ailing daughter and their community of Spanish influenza. The dance emerged just as Washington lawmakers enacted the Dance Order of 1921, which banned ritualistic dance on reservations. This attack on culture built on the Dawes Act of 1887, which partitioned and privatized reservation lands. In flagrant violation of the prohibition, and as the American and Canadian governments ripped indigenous children from their families and cultures to send them to boarding and residential schools, the jingle dress dance spread across the United States and Canada. Harris references the Haka, a Maori dance used to intimidate enemies and welcome guests, as a metaphor for the ways that Maori have effectively resisted, manipulated, and sidestepped the state over time. The Haka, which is emblematic of anti-imperialism, is all over Facebook, offered up by Maori communities in solidarity with the Mni Wiconi cause. Maori have even composed a special Haka for Standing Rock. Many Americans, Canadians, Australians, and New Zealanders believe that indigenous people are long gone and defeated. This racist myth has led empires and states to underestimate indigenous power. Global histories of indigenous resistance, survival, and resurgence tell another story. On these Oceti Sakowin plains in 1876, a cocksure General Custer rushed into the Battle of the Little Bighorn only to be soundly defeated by allied Lakota, Cheyenne, and Arapaho forces. Before defeating Custer, the Oceti Sakowin had a long history of settler handling. In 1862, the Dakota pushed thousands of settlers off the Minnesota frontier. Retribution followed many indigenous victories. In California, entire communities were hunted like animals. Later in 1890, the United States Army gunned down three hundred Lakota at Wounded Knee. This history continues to devastate. Indigenous people remain the poorest of the poor and the most likely to be killed by law enforcement. Four of the fifteen most impoverished counties in the United States include Lakota reservations in South Dakota. The two poorest, Oglala Lakota and Todd County, lie entirely within the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations, where half of all residents live in poverty. In Ziebach County, which includes parts of the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River reservations, 45 percent of the population lives at or below the poverty line. Elsewhere in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, indigenous people are among the poorest, most oppressed, and least visible. They are overrepresented in prisons and underrepresented in universities. Their economic realities are bleak. Their pain is intergenerational. In short, colonialism endures. Yet these same communities are uniquely positioned to resist unjust systems and force them to retreat. We must hold these two seemingly contradictory realities of devastation and resilience in our minds at the same time. The Fourth World lives in devastation. The Fourth World is unconquered and on the rise. Since the 1970s, indigenous people in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have danced impressive victories. They have compelled states to forego assimilationist policies like the involuntary removal of indigenous children to abusive residential schools and the relocation of indigenous workers to cities. Overtly coercive policies have been slowly and steadily replaced with policies that recognize indigenous rights to land, jurisdiction, and sovereignty. Gains are limited, but they are still gains. At certain times over the past thirty years, indigenous claims have prevented corporations from exploiting natural resources. In New Zealand in the 1980s, Maori claims under the Treaty of Waitangi stopped a state drive to privatize fisheries and hydroelectric power. In Canada and Australia, from the 1990s to the present, aboriginal claims have increased risk for prospective investors in extractive industries. But the dance with the state can be perilous. They accepted land claims settlements, treaty agreements, and business deals that enabled states to slash social services for the most vulnerable while restructuring indigenous communities as junior corporate partners in the global economy. As Trump prepares to take power in the US and Brexit changes the economic calculus in Britain and across the world, it is clear that the dance with the state is entering a new age. The New Colonialism The new age has precedents. Any Howard Zinn reader knows that the United States is built on stolen land with stolen labor. However, this is an observation too imprecise to help us understand and predict the trajectory of a global political economy steered and shaped by the likes of Trump and Nigel Farage. If you squint hard enough, Jack Dalrymple might look like a young George Custer, but that does not make him so. To prevail, indigenous people and the Left must fully understand the precise ways that emerging systems will dispossess indigenous communities. In the nineteenth century, the United States Army incarcerated indigenous people on reservations, claimed land for homesteaders, protected prospectors, and cleared the way for railroad barons. In the 1960s, a different set of historical, political, and economic forces erected the Lake Oahe Dam on the Missouri River, flooding two hundred thousand acres of the Standing Rock reservation to provide power to suburban homeowners. Today, the drive for independence from OPEC sees a solution in hydraulic fracturing technology. Inherently unaccountable capitalists are paid big money for being even more unaccountable, and indigenous dispossession continues on new frontiers. He will push to reopen and complete the Keystone XL Pipeline. If he keeps his campaign promises, he will support infrastructure projects and extractive industries, including coal and fracking, in indigenous homelands across the American hinterlands. At the same time, a conservative Supreme Court, an Interior Department led by Sarah Palin or oil baron Lucas Forrest, and a Justice Department led by Jeff Sessions means limited but hard-won Native rights will be rolled back. Native resistance will be policed by Orwellian surveillance systems finely tuned by the Obama administration. Militarized law enforcement will find reinforcements in the booming private security and prison industries. Law enforcement will have more power than ever to quash protesters and silence dissent. Politicians in the Commonwealth will look to roll back or restructure indigenous rights won over the last three decades in ways that are favorable to capital. With the Commonwealth clamoring to cash in on opportunities created by Brexit, new free trade deals with the United Kingdom will be struck, resuscitating and rebuilding the capital networks of the former British Empire, previously weakened by globalization and the European Single Market. The Tory dream of a revived Anglosphere, long derided as fanciful, nostalgic, and bad business by Liberals, may even emerge as a legitimate principle and framework of international relations and trade. It will compete with increasingly powerful Chinese and Indian capital throughout the Commonwealth, as already witnessed in the Canadian tar sands, Australian coalmines, and New Zealand real estate and dairy. If the history of the indigenous dance with the state is any indication, the Fourth World will suffer tremendously while at the same time standing athwart the forces of capitalism and exploitation. The Left must stand with the Fourth World in our collective struggle. The Army told Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the company building DAPL, that construction beneath the Missouri River required explicit approval, and asked the Standing Rock Sioux to negotiate conditions for the pipeline to cross tribal territory. Had it not been for thousands of people mobilizing behind an indigenous-led coalition, DAPL would have been business as usual. ETP would have desecrated the graves of Standing Rock ancestors unimpeded. Workers, lured by relatively high wages, would have taken on toxic and insecure work. Environmental degradation and runaway climate change would have pressed ahead unabated. Carbon dependency would have become even more deeply engrained in our political economy. Eventually, ETP and their investors would have cashed out, and future generations would have been robbed. In 2015, the Obama administration nixed the Keystone XL Pipeline, yielding to pressure from the Cowboy Indian Alliance. In Minnesota, Enbridge shelved plans for the Sandpiper pipeline, after encountering tribal opposition. The American and Canadian oil industries are more vulnerable than we realize. Fracked oil from the Bakken and Tar Sands is expensive to extract and refine. Meanwhile, OPEC is pumping at breakneck speed, driving down global oil prices. Oil infrastructure is costly, not only for indigenous people, workers, and the environment, but for investors too. Canadian oil producers have sold crude at a loss. The North Dakota and Tar Sands oil booms have busted. Indigenous opposition to pipelines through their territories has made investors uneasy. The show of force against indigenous protesters, however brutal, is an act of desperation to protect his infinitely deep pockets. If DAPL is not moving oil by the New Year, shipping contractors can cancel their transportation agreements. Standing Rock, on the other hand, is the future. This is the Fourth Way. The Fourth Way will harness the power and strategic location of indigenous people, exploiting pressure points beyond the workplace to oppose and transform unjust, unequal, and undemocratic systems. Movements working to reshape infrastructure, environmental policy, financial systems, policing, and work will be of particular importance to indigenous people. Regulations that dismantle financial instruments and policies that profit from natural resource speculation could divert and damage returns on capital flows. The abolition of mass incarceration would loosen the death grip of prisons and police on indigenous communities. Unions can turn individual workers into collective forces of resistance, helping drive up costs for developers and protect laborers from unsafe working conditions. Long-term efforts to reimagine work through full automation and a universal basic income could prevent laborers from having to seek such dangerous work in the first place. As Standing Rock has shown, indigenous nations that use their unique standing to advocate for viable alternatives to unjust systems will gain supporters. Our traditional territories encompass the rivers, mountains, and forests that capital exploits with abandon. Ours is a powerful voice envisioning a more harmonious and sustainable relationship with the natural world rooted in the resurgence of indigenous sovereignty. As long as indigenous people continue to make this argument, we are positioned to win policies, court decisions, and international agreements that protect and enlarge our sovereignty and jurisdiction. As our jurisdiction and sovereignty grow, we will have more power to stop, reroute, and transform carbon-based, capitalist, and colonial infrastructure. When the Justice Department halted construction of DAPL in October, they also said they would begin looking into Free Prior Informed Consent legislation. This is a minimal first step, and we must hold them to it. Longstanding alliances with progressive parties and politicians are key to our success. In Canada, First Nations have supported the New Democratic Party. Some indigenous leaders, such as outspoken Aboriginal Australian leader Pat Dodson, a Labour senator for Western Australia, have won prominent positions in these parties. This does not mean, of course, that we should pay deference to elected officials. In 2014, Obama became one of the first sitting presidents to visit an Indian reservation when he travelled to Standing Rock. His visit was historically symbolic and emotionally important, but if Obama fails to stop DAPL, indigenous people should renounce him. Politicians are helpful when they change policies and outcomes. We cannot and should not settle for symbolic victories. If there is to be an enduring indigenous-left coalition, the Left must support indigenous demands for land, jurisdiction, and sovereignty. At their core, these demands undermine the imperial cut-and-paste model of the nation-state, stretching from Hobbes to the present, which insists that there is room for just one sovereign entity in the state apparatus. He pushes us to think beyond the state. Similarly, indigenous demands for lands, jurisdiction, and sovereignty imply that we must think beneath it. As the Fourth World continues to push states to recognize our inherent, constitutional, and treaty rights as sovereign nations, the Left cannot remain neutral. To remain neutral is to perpetuate a long history of colonization. To remain neutral is to lose a valuable, organized, and powerful ally. Struggle Without End On November 15, more than 1,500 protesters gathered in Foley Square in Manhattan. We were just a fraction of the thousands who came together in cities across the country that day. Marching into the street, a few dozen of us locked arms, sat down and stopped traffic in an act of civil disobedience. We refused to move. We became the bodies blocking the behemoth. Police corralled us. An automated announcement warned us that we faced imminent arrest if we refused to move. We responded with even louder chants and songs to drown out the machine. The officers tightened their ranks and arrested us one by one. In jail, I was surprised to learn that I was just one of two indigenous arrestees. We can still stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The police may turn water cannons on us, assault and maim us, and lock us up, but we own the momentum. And even if we fail to defeat this pipeline, we will have prevailed in many battles along the way, and we can still win the long war. As we seek a way forward amid an ascendant right, the Fourth World has opened up a new window of political possibility. The Left must stand with them and start stitching their successful formula for resistance and transformation together with movements for economic, racial, environmental, gender, and sexual justice into a winning coalition. This is, and always has been, a long and difficult struggle of incremental victories and defeats. For the first people of this continent, it has raged for centuries. As we fight on, the songs and dances of our indigenous resistance find new steps, new verses, and new voices. Ya hey ya ho, hey ya ho.

She shares her experiences, and we hear from reflections from other Native people on the front lines. 2. The water protectors' direct actions are peaceful. This week's high-profile intervention was not the first time unarmed protesters have encountered police violence. Keene says part of the reason for the strong solidarity among Native tribes across the country is because the dispute over the the pipeline is part of a long-standing fight to have the sovereignty of their nations respected by the US government. These lands that the pipeline is cutting through right now are their homeland from time immemorial.. One advantage, however, is that Native people from the Plains are teaching the folks from warmer climates how to adapt, using lots of traditional methods from bonfires to longhouses. 6. Wellness teepees are helping campers deal with their mental and physical stress. This is not a Burning Man vibe. There is a protocol for how to enter these spaces, how to earn trust and eventually participate, according to Keene. Everyone has a job to do. 9.

Donate By Amy Goodman & Denis Moynihan No longer just tweeting, President Donald J. Trump has been issuing a stream of executive orders and memoranda since his inauguration. On Tuesday, his pronouncements involved the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Both projects were denied or delayed by the Obama administration, each after massive public protests. Opponents of DAPL fear a pipeline rupture could poison the Missouri River, which provides fresh water for 17 million people. The center of opposition has been at protest camps on and around the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where the pipeline is slated to cross the river. On Dec. 5, 2016, in a second victory for grass-roots environmental activists, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied the easement for DAPL to tunnel underneath the Missouri River, stopping that pipeline. The same language in the memo about the Keystone XL pipeline is addressed to the secretary of the Army, as well as to the secretary of state and the secretary of the interior. Bobbi Jean Three Legs, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, began protesting DAPL before the first resistance camp was set up last April. She helped lead a 2,000-mile relay run for native youth, from the Sacred Stone Camp in Cannon Ball, N.D., to Washington, D.C., to draw attention to their struggle against the pipeline. Bobbi Jean Three Legs and Winona LaDuke worry about increased violence from the police and National Guard. People are still getting maced. This is viewer supported news. Please do your part today.

The report was released by the Center for Native American Youth on Wednesday. The groundbreaking non-profit's efforts have helped draw unprecedented attention to the issues facing American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian youth, who are often overlooked at the national level. Shortly before the November 8 election, the organization released an open letter written by Native youth leaders. They asked the next president -- an unknown at the time -- to maintain the commitments they saw during the Obama administration. Republican Donald Trump secured a historic and surprise victory on that night yet he hasn't said anything about Native youth, or about any Native issues for that matter, as he creates his new team. But once he takes office on January 20, 2017, his actions will have a direct impact on millions of young lives in tribal communities. Key among the concerns is the ongoing crisis in North Dakota. Protecting sacred sites, burial grounds and water resources have been the rallying calls of the effort to keep the Dakota Access Pipeline away from the lands of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Those issues rank among the top priorities of Native youth, according to the report. But, as a result of the concerns raised by Native youth and the tribe, a key segment remains on hold pending further review by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The agency has yet to grant an easement for Dakota Access to drill under the Missouri River on public land less than mile from the northern border of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Beyond the pipeline, Native youth are also focused on health and wellness. Trump's new administration will play a big role on that front once he nominates someone to run the Indian Health Service, which in recent years has taken a greater role in addressing the high rates of suicide among young tribal citizens. So far Trump has signaled big changes that will have a major impact on those efforts. He plans to nominate Rep. Tom Price (R-Georgia) to run the Department of Health and Human Services, the parent agency of the IHS. Price, like many other Republicans, has called for a full-scale repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the landmark law that permanently reauthorized the Indian Health Care Improvement Act. But neither the Congressman nor Trump have said what they will do to replace the programs affected by the IHCIA or how they will address funding for the IHS. The incoming Trump administration will also affect other Native youth priorities like protecting the Indian Child Welfare Act. Whoever the new president picks to run the Bureau of Indian Affairs will be charged with enforcing a new rule that requires state courts and state agencies to ensure they are following the 1978 law by keeping Native children connected to their communities. The rule takes effect December 12 and it's unlikely that Trump could overturn it. Other Native youth priorities, like juvenile justice reform, fall under the purview of the Department of Justice. Trump plans to nominate Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama) as his Attorney General but the lawmaker does not have much of a record or interest in Indian issues. Finally, education remains high on the Native youth agenda. Most Native youth attend public schools and Trump plans to nominate Betsy DeVos to run the Department of Education. DeVos has been a strong advocate of school choice, in which funds from the public school system are funneled to other institutions, often in the private sector. Some Republicans even want to open the Bureau of Indian Education, which is run by the BIA, to the same type of program in hopes of improving achievement levels among Native youth. Historically, they have fallen behind their peers on standardized tests and in high school graduation rates. The National Indian Education Association and Democrats strongly oppose the idea and while Native youth didn't speak directly on the issue in the CNAY report, they say one of the best ways to improve academic performance is to recognize their unique heritages. Retired Sen. Byron Dorgan (D-North Dakota), who founded the Center for Native American Youth with leftover campaign funds, will host Native youth leaders and Interior Secretary Sally Jewell in Washington, D.C., on Thursday to discuss the report. The event, which takes place from 12pm - 1:30pm Eastern, will be streamed live. Dorgan said.

An obscure West Virginia law that came to light during the teachers strike gives police expansive powers to crack down on peaceful protesters.

A bill ostensibly meant to bring the law into the 21st century was introduced before the strike began, but the revisions fall short. But the bill would still allow police officers to commandeer private citizens to help disperse a crowd. In many ways, these dangers mirror the troubling nature of the broader anti-protest legislative trend around the country. In many states, these legislative efforts ignore existing law. If passed, it would not only chill environmental protest, but it would replicate an existing law that already criminalizes property damage. In Wyoming, legislators are considering a similarly repetitive and harmful bill. In West Virginia, lawmakers are now in danger of reaffirming an existing, antiquated law.

On February 22, the Oceti Oyate camp, formerly known as Oceti Sakowin, as well as all other camps on treaty land claimed by the US Army Corps, were ordered to evacuate by 2pm. Hundreds flocked back to Standing Rock to pray as the company resumed drilling under the Missouri River following the granting of the final easement by the US Army Corps on February 7th. Ten unarmed water protectors were arrested and one was badly injured in a violent crackdown. Several of those arrested were journalists and legal observers, clearly targeted for their role in documenting police violence and rights violations. One water protector was tazed Fires kept law enforcement from entering the camps, but they continue to build presence at Standing Rock, preparing to forcibly remove water protectors from unceded territory affirmed in the 1851 and 1868 Ft. Laramie Treaties as sovereign land of the Great Sioux Nation. A contingent of nearly two dozen National Park Service rangers and U.S. Park Police officers arrived at the request of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe with tactical gear ranging from gas masks and riot gear to rifles, protective vests, and night vision goggles. The Sacred Stone Camp is standing ground, but raids on the remaining camps could happen at any moment. If you witnessed an arrest today at Standing Rock, are arrested, or are concerned about the possible arrest of a relative or loved one, please call the legal jail support line: 605.519.8180. With law enforcement preparing to advance, the legal teams are standing by (Freshet Collective and Water Protector Legal Collective - www.waterprotectorlegal.org ) and will continue to work around the clock to support and stand in solidarity with water protectors. Over 700 water protectors are now fighting criminal cases, and North Dakota is handing down convictions. Six people face federal charges, which carry sentences of up to 15 years.

In preparation, we've been helping plan the next international day of action targeting banks to divest from the dangerous project. Today, Bank DNB announced it is going to sell its assets in the Dakota Access Pipeline project. Original petition text: Over 100 water protectors were brutally arrested by Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) security forces -- some locked in dog kennels and shot at with rubber bullets and pepper spray -- just for standing up for their ancestral lands and our most precious resource, water. Thousands have peacefully gathered in person and in solidarity to stop this 570,000 barrel-per-day pipeline that would endanger the water and ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. And while this inspiring work is going on, the banks that we use every day are backing the project with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and investment each. Demand your bank to stop financially supporting from the Dakota Access Pipeline and associated projects such as Energy Transfer now. North Dakota recorded nearly 300 oil pipeline spills in less than two years -- and none were disclosed to the public. The DAPL was originally going to be routed near the city of Bismarck -- but was rejected because it would have run so close to municipal water sources. Bank DNB, BBVA, TD, Wells Fargo, Mizuho Bank, BayernLB, Citibank, ING, Deutsche Bank, RBC, Credit Suisse, UBS, Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole, Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, and ABN Amro Capital all support the project financially. These banks are vulnerable to public pressure. We are their customers and shareholders -- and they need our business. Stop the money, stop a pipeline. Tell your bank to stop funding the project now. What we are bearing witness to at Standing Rock is a moment of history. We can't all be in North Dakota, but we can all stand in solidarity with those who are.

Israeli Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the ban was introduced after some Palestinians barricaded themselves inside the Al-Aqsa Mosque at the holy site -- which is known as the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims and the Temple Mount to Jews -- overnight so they could join protests later. Rosenfeld said the would-be protesters were removed. Clashes erupted Thursday between police and Muslim worshipers shortly after the site in the Old City reopened following an 11-day prayer boycott over metal detectors and other security measures Israel installed at the site, which is administered by Jordan.

Hundreds of people were injured and one woman may have her arm amputated. In response a coalition of groups at Standing Rock are calling for a week of action starting on November 25th that will culminate in a Global Day of Action on December 1st. The main targets are financiers of the Dakota Access Pipeline and the police departments that have been brought in from across the Midwest to brutalize water protectors. In Vancouver Scotiabank, Royalbank and Toronto Dominion are all guilty of supporting DAPL. The financial footing of the Dakota Access Pipeline is in jeopardy if they do not complete the project by January 1st. If this deadline is missed, a majority of the stakeholders with contracts to ship oil through the pipeline will be able to renegotiate or cancel their contracts. This could be devastating to Energy Transfer Partners and the other pipeline companies behind DAPL. With its vulnerabilities exposed, our solidarity efforts are needed now more than ever.

Police and private security forces outfitted in riot gear and armed with assault weapons have unleashed dogs, pepper spray and rubber bullets on peaceful Native Americans and their allies. Overzealous law enforcement officials in North Dakota have jailed journalists and celebrities who were exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech and the press by documenting police attacks on protesters. These actions are a serious affront to the Constitution and sovereign tribal rights and are an egregious abuse of power by the police and government in order to protect the fossil fuel industry. Tell North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple and the U.S. Department of Justice: Stop police abuse and protect the Constitution, not the fossil fuel industry. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of over 200 other tribes from across the Americas are leading the resistance to protect sovereign land and drinking water from destruction by the fossil fuel industry. However, in an attempt to quell these historic nonviolent protests, Gov. Dalrymple ordered a state of emergency that has militarized the police force, set up a highway roadblock and mobilized the National Guard to intimidate protesters. Her reporting went viral, with over 14 million people on Facebook and millions more through the mainstream media viewing her reporting. Tell North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple and the U.S. Department of Justice: Stop police abuse and protect the Constitution, not the fossil fuel industry.

The injustices perpetrated by the government and the fossil fuel industry against journalists, Native peoples and their allies are an unacceptable assault on the First Amendment.

All of this underscores the severe dangers of having our public discourse overtaken, regulated, and controlled by a tiny number of unaccountable tech giants.

And more video footage showing Israeli security forces using excessive force on a handcuffed Palestinian-American boy further called into question who was really inciting this chaos. To ask the question is to answer it. Israel has been particularly aggressive in attempting to blame Facebook for violence and coerce it to censor. But that proposition ignores the unprecedented control this small group of corporations now exerts over global communications. But as is so often the case with censorship, people are content with its application until it is used to suppress views they agree with or like.

Bruce Schneier, a prominent security expert, told BuzzFeed News he thinks more people are installing Signal because they are afraid their communications will be intercepted and read by others. But the wider adoption of encryption is crucial to its success. For Timm, encryption has never been more important. But the prevailing view among Silicon Valley executives, computer scientists, and security experts is that encryption is a crucial defense against an onslaught of criminal hacks, seemingly endless data breaches, and invasive government surveillance. In the past, sales upticks at Silent Circle have been triggered by news coverage of UK surveillance programs, and, on an even greater scale, the Snowden revelations. On the campaign trail, Trump sided with the Justice Department in its fierce dispute with Apple over gaining access to an encrypted iPhone, and he called for a boycott of Apple products until the company agreed to circumvent its own security features. At times, Trump has pushed for increased surveillance of Americans, including monitoring mosques.

Schulz also urged outgoing President Barack Obama's administration to decide whether the company can complete the pipeline by drilling underneath Lake Oahe on the Missouri River. The river passes directly through the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, and the tribe fears any break could contaminate the water. 'Hard times may be ahead' People in that main camp, however, vow to defy the Corps' deadline. While a group called the Water Protector Legal Collective, which has been providing legal assistance to people involved in the demonstrations, issued a press release critical of the Corps' reasons for issuing the eviction.

Some people come for the weekend, others have quit their jobs and made resisting this pipeline their full time work. They spend their days building infrastructure at the camp, chopping wood, sorting donations, praying and singing at the main fire, and putting their bodies on the line between the land and an energy company determined to drill through it. Dedicated volunteers at the Oceti Sakowin Camp, the Sacred Stone Camp, and the Rosebud Camp, all clustered at the edge of the Cannonball River, spend hours a day focused on exactly that. I had the opportunity to visit Oceti Sakowin from November 17-28, and to work in and visit some of these kitchens. Inside the Main Kitchen. Photo by Brian Yazzie I started out in the Main Kitchen, in the upper portion of Oceti Sakowin camp, since this is where my friend Chef Brian Yazzie had been working during his visits, and he wanted me to check and see how they were doing. But by the time I arrived Conan, a vegan chef of Afro-Euro-Asian-Indigenous Caribbean ancestry from the Netherlands, had softened a little. He described how he had once worked for a collective of vegan chefs, cooking in refugee camps in Greece for 8,000 people a day. He described the reactions of the refugees as similar to the Native people he was cooking for here. They needed a traditional soup to feed them all. In one hour. In this way, through a constant series of improvisations, everyone is fed. Photo by Elizabeth Hoover Since the founding of that Main Kitchen, other kitchens have split off, to serve their own style of cuisine or their own distinct communities. Winona Kasto, from the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, arrived at the Oceti Sakowin camp in August with a pup tent and two pairs of clothes, and has been back and forth ever since. Which people are happy to do, in exchange for the food that she offers freely. Her kitchen has received donations from her tribe (Cheyenne River Sioux), as well as buffalo from the Northern Cheyenne Araphao tribe, and lots of eggs and potatoes from Organic Valley Farms. In the week and a half I was there, this camp and kitchen changed by the day, as new tents went up to house produce, dry goods, and a new dining hall. In the background is the water truck that came around every day to deliver fresh drinking water to camps. Photo by Elizabeth Hoover Winona shelling dried sweet corn. Photo by Elizabeth Hoover Rachel (on the right) from All Relations Kitchen. Photo by Elizabeth Hoover Another large kitchen, in the lower half of camp (to the north of flag road) is the All Relations (also known as Lower Brule) kitchen. Rachel, who works along side fellow head chef Maria in this kitchen, has been at Oceti Sakowin camp for two months. To be a good relative we receive people and welcome you. Whatever we have, we can offer. The shelves, the pots, even the floors, extra storage. People whose friends have eaten in her kitchen seek Rachel out, and she welcomes them all in. Diane Hart and Pat Joseph in the California Kitchen. Diane is from Bishop Paiute tribe in California, and her tribe, as well as the Seven Council Fires, has provided much of the infrastructure for this camp. Everything else comes from donations, which were constantly streaming in the door. She retrieved what she could from the wreckage, although was disgusted to report that many of her things were torn apart and urinated on by police, and had to be discarded, and that one of her big tents was destroyed by a bulldozer. She gathered what was left and moved her kitchen back down to the Oceti Sakowin camp. They currently feed hundreds of people a day out of this kitchen, planning the menu on the fly each day depending on what meat is thawed and which donations have come in. Dan set to work pawing through it and pulling out a number of ears to prepare. We then rinsed the corn, and set it aside to add to a wild rice and hominy salad. We never got a photo of the finished product becuase we ran to the front lines of the action on the bridge on Sunday night (November 20), before the salad was finished. We were working in California kitchen when a man rushed in and declared all able bodied people needed to rush to the front lines because the camp was under attack. tear gas, launched at water protectors. photo by Elizabeth Hoover icy water sprayed on water protectors. photo by Elizabeth Hoover icy water sprayed on water protectors. photo by Elizabeth Hoover But some did stay behind, to finish the meal, and make sure cold and injured water protectors had hot food to come back to. Grandma Diane had recounted the night that all of the Main Kitchen staff were arrested on the front lines, which then meant all of the other kitchens had to step up to feed everyone. Now to prevent this, she makes sure some stay behind to do the important work of keeping everyone fed. Oglala (Wounded Knee) kitchen Southwest camp kitchen Two Spirit camp kitchen New kitchen being built at Sacred Stone camp. Photo by Elizabeth Hoover All of these kitchens are powered through donations, some of which go directly to the individual kitchens, and many of which go directly to the Main Kitchen to be stored in the army tent pantries. By November, the white rice had formed its own mountain, along side bean mountain. Most of the food was good; some arrived years expired, or in unlabeled home canned jars with mysterious contents.

Photos by Elizabeth Hoover AIM chapter out of California delivering food supplies to the Main Kitchen. Becuase Brian had cooked at the camp before, he knew what to bring. People came from various kitchens across camp to collect fresh fruit and produce, cooking pots and pans, cutting boards and knives, and other necessary camp supplies. Brian Yazzie handing off produce to Winona. Photo by Elizabeth Hoover Shark meat and venison tacos made by chef Brian Yazzie. Shark meat from California was one of the more unusual food donations, along with 2,000 lbs of alpaca meat donated by a couple from Oregon, that Winona turned into stew. Photo by Elizabeth Hoover Chef Brian Yazzie with smoked buffalo burgers. Hasty photo by Elizabeth Hoover (before stuffing them into my mouth) In addition to much needed fresh produce, there have also been efforts to bring traditional indigenous foods to camp to feed water protectors.

Photo by Dan Cornelius Dan dropping wild rice off to Lee Sprague, of the Cold Water Rescue Team, at Pueblo camp. Photo by Elizabeth Hoover Traditional foods are considered an important tool in, and motivation for, winning this fight against polluting fossil fuels. Dried red chile, Green chile, Elk meat, Deer meat, Buffalo Meat, Tamales, Pueblo pies, Pueblo Cookies. Frybread being made at Pueblo Camp. They were later rescued by a group of veterans, although they have been rendered unusable. Photo by Elizabeth Hoover In addition to fueling bodies with traditional foods, the methods and tools used to procure them are being repurposed to the fight. He lamented how those canoes had gone out hundreds of time to gather traditional foods, and were now intended for his daughters to learn this skill. Undeterred, the Cold Water Rescue Team is procuring new boats. Canoes being used to ferry water protectors over to Turtle Island, the day before they were stolen and destroyed. Photo by Elizabeth Hoover The action on Turtle Island was happening at the same time as Native chefs back at camp were coordinating an epic Thanksgiving dinner. Jane Fonda and Shaylene Woodley coordinated with cafe owner Judy Wicks to cater and serve dinner to water protectors at the Standing Rock High School. People at the camp had mixed feelings about Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving was a holiday that appropriated Native peoples and she refused to take part in it. She and others were going to have their big meal the next day instead. People were not celebrating a fabricated scene between Pilgrims and Indians, they were there celebrating life and unity, and praying for the protection of their camp and the water. Native elders, then women and children and then men were served first. Then non-Native people were invited into the dome to eat. Thanksgiving Dinner in the geodome. There were bean salads, maccaroni salads and green salads. There were also a number of wild rice dishes, cut up fruit, pies, and fry bread. Serving Thanksgiving dinner inside the geodome. Photo by Brian Yazzie Prayerful march to Turtle Island on Thanksgiving Day. Photo by Elizabeth Hoover I want to conclude just by saying how I continue to be amazed with, and touched by these food providers. I was impressed with their generosity of time, spirit, and food. The determination with which they approached each morning and each meal. The absolute fierceness with which they loved each person who came into their kitchens, and each person who went to the front lines for this movement. On December 4th cheers erupted around the country when it was announced that the Army Corp of Engineers was denying DAPL a permit to drill under Lake Oahe. But many people at this camp, including the chefs, are skeptical and not packing up yet. As I write, Winona is currently coordinating an emergency kitchen at the Casino Pavilion for people who are being evacuated from Oceti Sakowin during a blizzard. The movement continues. Winona Katso and her immense soup pot. On the evening of the Nov 20th bridge action, Winona was cooking soup until 3am, making sure that each cold and wet water protector who came back to camp had a hot meal.

Many on social media cautioned that this was not the Santa-is-real everything-is-OK-forever victory and we should not celebrate. But the people most involved seemed to realize that this is not necessarily the end of the road, but a really great milestone. But it might be a really big victory, and mid-January might be too late to salvage some of what the frenzied pipeline builders were hoping for as they raced toward their deadlines. Global oil prices began to collapse just a few months after shippers committed to using DAPL, and market forecasters do not expect prices to regain 2014 levels for at least a decade. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Saudi artist: Standing Rock protesters are warning us to save what we can Which this gift from the US Army Corps makes quite unlikely. False omniscience is a habit that makes people as politically destructive as they are personally annoying, and plenty of people made pronouncements about what was going to happen and what would never happen at Standing Rock that turned out to be wrong. Another is standing up for what you believe in, even when victory seems remote to impossible. Sunday was the pipeline victory. Monday was the 61st anniversary of the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott. Surely more than integrating the public transit system. They could hardly have expected that they would help launch a movement that not only changed the nation and led to national legislation, but offered a toolbox of nonviolent strategies and visions to the world, used in South Africa and Egypt, in Czechoslovakia and the Philippines. They bet that the future would be different than the past and did everything to make it so. Consequences are often indirect. The movement at Standing Rock may yet stop a pipeline. Whether it does or not, it has brought together perhaps the greatest single gathering of native North Americans (from Canada as well as the United States) ever, and that has been a profound and moving watershed for the affirmation of cultural identities and political rights. It has demonstrated yet again that the environmental movement and human rights campaigns are often inseparable, reminded us that worldwide, indigenous people are in the forefront of the climate movement. Many things we cannot foresee may come of this gathering and its vision, tactics and power. In this moment of rightwing and white supremacist triumphalism, we are hearing a lot about hate crimes: beatings, insults, swastikas, threats and the rest. But also rising into view is another America: the people who stand up for racial justice, for the vulnerable, for women and LGBT people, for science, for nature and for democracy. Standing Rock prefigured and modeled those possibilities and was radiant with this beauty. I went to Standing Rock in early September, when the weather was delightful and the landscape green. The people who persevered into this brutal winter were heroic, enduring harsh conditions and risking bodily safety for the wellbeing of the river, the tribal rights and their principles. Sometimes in direct ways, when we remake history. And on Sunday the people there and those protesting in banks, writing letters, sending donations, organizing marches around the country won something worth celebrating. We are facing a lot of trouble on all fronts. Standing Rock reminds us to come together and stand up to it. Please choose your username under which you would like all your comments to show up.

One of the Stanley Mission walkers celebrates the group's arrival in the main Standing Rock protest camp in North Dakota. (Submitted by Susan ThreeIrons) When the Stanley Mission group first began its march to Standing Rock, thousands of protestors had already gathered in North Dakota, and tensions were high as they fought to stop construction of the Dakota Access pipeline along the Missouri River. We are trying to save the future. Ricky Sanderson departed from Stanley Mission, Sask. in November 2016 arrived at the Standing Rock camps on Jan. 10. Now that they have arrived, Sanderson said that protestors intend to stay, worried that if they do pull up stakes in the camps that the pipeline construction companies will move right back in.

The Water Protector Legal Collective is still fighting 427 criminal cases against water protectors who were arrested in prayer and nonviolent action opposing the construction and operation of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). WPLC is also mounting an offensive against the Morton County Sheriff and other agencies who subjected hundreds of water protectors to brutal repression and wrongful arrests. We need your donations to successfully defend all of the remaining criminal charges and to stop the government and security company misconduct and obtain redress for the water protectors who were harmed. WPLC is the indigenous led legal team on the ground in North Dakota. WPLC has been providing legal representation, coordination and advocacy for all 838 water protectors who have been arrested in resistance to DAPL since August, 2016. Through our efforts, 289 cases have been dismissed to date, and there have only been a handful of convictions for minor charges, none of which have resulted in jail time. We also work in collaboration with the Freshet Collective to provide jail and court support for the arrestees. More cases are being dismissed each week but we expect to be fighting the criminal cases through the spring of 2018 and prosecuting the civil litigation for years. The pipeline struggle is far from over. Construction of the DAPL is currently complete and the pipeline is operational, carrying fracked crude oil from the Bakken fields of North Dakota, to Patoka, Illinois. On June 14, 2017, a federal court ruled that the permit hastily granted by the Trump administration violated the National Environmental Policy Act in several key respects, including by not adequately considering the risk of an oil spill, and the impacts of an oil spill on the Sioux Nations and their treaty rights. But the court has not yet decided whether it will halt pipeline operation. The pipeline crosses through unceded lands of the Oceti Sakowin (Great Sioux Nation), with many sacred sites, historic cultural sites and burial sites in its path, and crosses the Missouri River just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Mni Sosa (Missouri) is the primary source of drinking and agricultural water for the Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, and Oglala Sioux nations and sacred and central to their religion and traditions.

We will post new developments here. As of this posting, protests are taking place in various cities. And it is urgent that this important struggle be part of the defining struggle to STOP the fascist regime of Trump-Pence before it consolidates its power. The encampment near North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux reservation, December 4, 2016. Below is background to this important struggle. Continuing to Stand Strong at Standing Rock... and Spreading the Struggle December 12, 2016 Over the past week, there have been important developments in the resistance to the Dakota Access Oil Pipeline (DAPL) that threatens the water and tramples treaty rights of the Standing Rock Sioux in the western Dakotas. Revolution reported on how thousands of people, including a contingent of veterans, went to Standing Rock to stand with people threatened with eviction by federal and state officials. Revolution Clubs mobilized around the country and sent a delegation to stand with people there, and connect them with organizing for an actual revolution. Thousands of Native American Indians, along with supporters, have been camping out there. They have been protesting the installation of an oil pipeline that gravely threatens the water that Native people and thousands of others in the area depend on, and violates Indian treaty rights. Hundreds have been arrested and hundreds more have stood up to beatings, macings, high-powered water hoses in sub-freezing weather, and unending harassment and insult. Now the Army of Corps of Engineers has vowed to arrest anyone who remains in the camp past Monday, December 5. The Native people cannot be left to face this alone. The environment cannot withstand yet another insult. Read more Resistance at Standing Rock Forces Gov't to Back Down for Now... The Struggle Continues December 5, 2016 The past 24 hours have seen dramatic developments in the battle to stop the Dakota Access Oil Pipeline (DAPL) from endangering the water and violating the treaty rights of the Standing Rock Sioux.

This action was in protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, and in solidarity with the encampment and protest at Standing Rock. The burning of that oil would pump more greenhouse gases into the environment, further escalating the global climate crisis. The pipeline route cuts through land that is historically and culturally important to the Sioux and other Native people. And leaks from the pipeline where it is designed to cross the Missouri River would threaten the water, health, and livelihood of the people at Standing Rock reservation and millions of others in the region. Thousands of people are now part of an encampment near the Standing Rock reservation. Well-known voices, such as Edward Snowden and Susan Sarandon, have come out in support of the anti-DAPL protests, and actor Shailene Woodley was among those arrested at a protest earlier this month. At least 19 city governments have passed resolutions or written letters opposing construction of the pipeline. The determined actions of the fighters at Standing Rock are posing big questions about the ongoing genocide of indigenous people and the predatory nature of the oil-addicted capitalist-imperialist system. Whatever the conflicts among themselves, they are in agreement on the need, based on their imperialist interests, to increase domestic fuel production in order to gain strategic advantage over rival world powers, as part of maintaining their position as top global oppressor and exploiter. 1. 2. The defeat of this imperialist state has opened the way to overcoming the effects and legacy of this terrible history. As one key expression of the importance it attaches to this, the New Socialist Republic in North America shall ensure that the right of autonomy of Native American peoples within this Republic is upheld; and, beyond that, wherever autonomous regions of Native Americans may be established, in the general vicinity of the historical homelands of the various native peoples, the central government will also act to ensure that these autonomous regions not only have the necessary territories but also the resources that will enable a real flourishing of these peoples, within the overall framework of the New Socialist Republic in North America. The central government of the New Socialist Republic in North America will provide special assistance and support to any Native American autonomous regions, on the basis of the principles and objectives set forth in this Constitution. 3. Such special assistance and support will also be of great importance, and shall be extended, to all the formerly oppressed peoples, and any autonomous regions and areas of these peoples, within the New Socialist Republic in North America.

Now, of course, slavery was not the only factor that played a significant part in the emergence of the U.S. as a world power, whose economic strength underlies its massive military force. A major historical factor in all this was the theft of land, on a massive scale, from Mexico as well as from native peoples. But, in turn, much of that conquest of land was, for a long period of time up until the Civil War, largely to expand the slave system. Bob Avakian, BAsics 1:2 This system and those who rule over it are not capable of carrying out economic development to meet the needs of the people now, while balancing that with the needs of future generations and requirements of safeguarding the environment.

This blatant attack was unprovoked - there were young children and elders in this crowd for prayer. The 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie supposedly guaranteed Native people the right to certain lands. But as oil and minerals were discovered, the lands were grabbed back by the U.S. government. On Saturday, October 22, 83 people were arrested as 300 protestors stood their ground to block the attempts to build the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. The proposed pipeline would savage the environment and endanger several nearby Native American reservations and lands. September 9, more than a thousand people gather at an encampment to protest Dakota Access oil pipeline near North Dakota's Standing Rock Sioux reservation. They have heroically resisted pepper gas, beatings, and hundreds of arrests. In their determined resistance they have brought to the fore the whole history of broken treaties and genocide against the Native American peoples. Read online....

It is a continuation of the populist fervor building up in the United States. It is a continuation of the pursuit of infinite growth. It is a story of physical power, political power and economic power. The pipeline is designed to transport 570,000 barrels per day of U.S. light sweet from the Bakken and Three Forks production region of North Dakota to Patoka, Ill. A power level equal to more than half of the peak electric load in Texas on the hottest summer day, an amount of power that is not trivial. In the early days of the Fossil Fuel Age, a small group of people could restrict the flow of coal and thus significant physical power. Those who can restrict or control physical power can command economic power, and those in control of economic power can command political power. The Dakota Access pipeline is no different. In short, it is all about power. Thus, by challenging the physical flow of power, the Standing Rock tribe challenged the current economic and political power. After months of protest, they saw local law enforcement treat them as the first African-Americans integrated into southern universities were treated: with tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. These Native Americans and those joining them were on a slow path to defeat, with orders to vacate the protest camp. They simply did not represent enough political or economic power. However, the power struggle turned in their favor as soon as a new political power arrived in the form of a group of 2,000 military veterans. Firing tear gas and water cannons at Native Americans is bad for business. Doing the same to military veterans is a public relations nightmare for business and politicians. As President-elect Donald Trump discusses approving the Dakota Access pipeline route, attempting to reverse the decision of his predecessor as quickly as possible, it will test his populist credentials that he sold to the American public. The oil in the ground is no use if it cannot flow to the pump. But alas, there is also less use in gasoline flowing to the pump if fewer and fewer people can afford to use it. More power flowing to fewer pockets is not what Trump claims to promote. The Keystone XL oil pipeline debate centered on carbon and climate concerns and from where our physical power originates. The voters in Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan who helped put Trump in White House were not thinking about climate change. These Americans felt left behind by increased global competition. They lost economic power and control over their lives. Trump told them he would give both back to them. Whether that actually happens remains to be seen. The Dakota Access pipeline concerns the same story. The Native Americans, protesters and veterans in North Dakota showed up as a test of power of the local people against broader business interests. They won this battle, but if history is any indication, they likely will not win the war for stopping or rerouting the pipeline. Obama bought them some time. Only time will tell just exactly what Trump will buy for them, and thus, which citizens of America he is helping to be great again. Trump needs to let us know if he thinks there is equal power for ensuring a right of way versus the right to get in the way.

Humanity's Future Standing with Standing Rock Courtesy Jane Fonda By Jane Fonda December 1, 2016 IDEAS Fonda is an Oscar-winning actress, writer and activist. I was at Standing Rock Sioux Reservation near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, during the Thanksgiving holiday supporting Indigenous Peoples, the Water Protectors, from over 300 tribes and their allies from around the world. Thousands of people, with 2,000 veterans from Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan about to join them. Their aim is to stop Sunoco Logistics and its Dakota Access Pipeline from crossing Standing Rock ancestral lands and drilling beneath the Missouri River. I came away with the belief that what is happening at Standing Rock is an existential confrontation between two opposing world views. One is represented by the Indigenous Water Protectors and their allies who believe our future depends on respecting the land and water on which human life depends. The people on the front lines are very brave. They stand, carrying their banners, chanting, and praying with arms reaching toward the sky. They are unarmed as they face the Morton County Police. They have all been trained in non-violent civil disobedience. No weapons of any kind. And no drugs or alcohol are allowed in the camps. The aggressor side, with militarized police defending their interests, is represented by those who insist on unfettered extraction of non-renewable fossil fuels no matter the consequences. Greed versus a habitable planet. Because of where we find ourselves at this precarious moment in history, with the reality of climate change close to its tipping point, if the short-term, profit-oriented view is allowed to prevail, it could actually spell the end of human life as we know it. This is the existential crossroad. The choice is ours to make and it must be done quickly. Extraction and transportation of oil and gas is a dirty business. According to the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, since 2010 there have been oil spills in the U.S. amounting to more than 7 million gallons of crude. But within that dirty business, the vast network of pipelines operated by Sunoco Logistics (which recently announced intentions to buy Energy Transfer Partners, which is building the pipeline), holds the record. It has leaked more than 200 times since 2010, making it the company with the worst spill record in the US, according to a Reuters analysis of government data. It is no coincidence that Energy Transfer Partner (ETP) and its poor environmental record is complemented by egregious treatment of communities impacted by its operations. Their tactics have escalated from attack dogs and pepper spray to mace, rubber bullets and water cannons in freezing temperatures. False information is broadcast to justify their brutal tactics. Journalists are intimidated and censored. The Indigenous Peoples who are defending the lands and water are descendants of cultures with powerful identities stretching back for centuries, long before white European settlers arrived. They had alphabets. You must make him understand the value of property, and the benefits of its separate ownership. Great tribal nations were uprooted from their ancestral lands and deported to reservations. Smallpox-infected blankets were given to native peoples, wiping out entire tribes. The immense herds of Great Plains Bison, which tribes relied on for food, clothing and shelter, were killed off. The number of bison dropped from over 50 million to fewer than 800. Nearly 400 treaties were negotiated, almost none of them honored by the US. Sixty percent of the land supposedly designated for Indians ended up being owned by whites. Robbed of their lands, their hunting grounds, their central means of subsistence, their cultural basis of life, a sizable portion of Indigenous Peoples were ultimately forced to adopt the way of the white colonizers on whom they became dependent for food, supplies, shelter, entirely losing their self-reliance. We have witnessed the sad results as Indigenous Peoples left their reservations and tried to assimilate, moving into cities to find work and education. But they bore the deep, traumatic wounds of colonization and too many turned to drugs and spirits to fill the emptiness once inhabited by the Spirit. Generations of men and women lost their traditional ceremonies, songs, even their native languages. I met Alayna Eagle Shield at Standing Rock. She and her children have learned to speak their native Lakota. Generations of Indigenous Peoples grew up ashamed of who they were. Guided by the true tribal elders who refused to give up their ways, there has been a return to traditional language, prayer and ceremonies in many parts of Indian Country. Some say this movement began during the occupation of the former prison Island of Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay from November 20, 1969, to June 11, 1971. Young Indian students from the Bay Area were the first occupiers. When I went to witness the occupation for myself in June, 1970, elders from different tribes had joined them. The late Wilma Mankiller was a young woman on Alcatraz when she first met the great Thomas Banyacya, the traditional elder chosen by the Hopi Tribe as an interpreter of Hopi prophecies which have long warned of threats to the natural balance of the earth and its creatures. Wilma later told me that this encounter changed her life. She went on to become the very powerful first female chief of the Cherokee Nation. They began to see that often, through prayer and ceremony, people could begin to heal, to get clean and sober. It has been 45 years since the Occupation of Alcatraz. At Standing Rock we are witnessing the flowering of the seeds that were planted there and, again, it is the youth who seem to be leading the way. At Standing Rock, it is the youth who decided the focus needed to be on water. The astonishing courage of their run was what first brought public attention to the impending crisis in Standing Rock. Oceti Sakowin is the largest camp. The Lakota are part of a confederation of seven related Sioux tribes which once lived across the vast plains of North America. Over time, the U.S. government took more and more Sioux land breaking up the reservation into smaller ones such as Pine Ridge, Rosebud and Standing Rock. What is happening at Standing Rock is historic. This is the first time since Little Big Horn in 1876 that Oceti Sakowin have come together in peace as one family. As I walked through the camp I heard Lakota prayers, saw the ceremonial fires burning, the sweat lodges where people go regularly to pray. I saw people treating each other with kindness, helping each other to chop and share firewood, food, clothing and shelter. I have never been hugged so much in my life. We must do all we can to make sure the Water Protectors are victorious. These are people fighting not simply against their oppressors but also for the earth and all its creatures including us. If we can do this it will represent an historic turning point. There are immediate things we can do. For one, help children with school supplies. Or support the International indigenous youth council. Or fund self-reporting from within the camps. Then there are the longer-term things that need to happen. We are all interconnected, interdependent, but the fabric of our common tapestry is starting to unravel. We must rapidly cure ourselves of this disease or it will take us all down.

Celebrities that have offered support include Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Shailene Woodley, and even Neil Young. Now, actress and activist Jane Fonda is expected to arrive in North Dakota within the week to help serve a Thanksgiving dinner to the protestors at Standing Rock. NativeNewsOnline reports that the two-time Academy Award-winner will visit the water protectors at the Oceti Sakowin camp as part of a delegation of 50 people from around the country. The intent is to serve a Wopila Feast to thank American Indian water protectors for their courage in defending Mother Earth. Fonda will also contribute five butchered Bison and four Mongolian yurts to the camp. As Native Village points out, Fonda is a long-time supporter of American Indian rights. In 1969, the activist supported the Alcatrez Island occupation by American Indians; this brought attention to treaty rights. And in 1970, Fonda traveled to Seattle, Washington, to offer support to a group of American Indians who occupied part of Fort Lawton to get land that was being surplussed by the United States Army. In that instance, the group succeeded. This article (Actress Jane Fonda Will Serve A Thanksgiving Feast To Standing Rock Protestors) is free and open source.

In 1890, police murdered Sitting Bull on the Standing Rock reservation out of suspicion that he was preparing to lead the Ghost Dance movement in an uprising. Two weeks later the United States Cavalry massacred more than three hundred Lakota at Wounded Knee. Over 126 years later, the characters and details of the stories that animate this landscape have changed, but the Cowboys and Indians remain locked in the same grim dance. For many, it is contentious and even laughable to suggest that colonialism endures in the present. In the American popular imagination, colonialism ended either when the 13 colonies declared independence from Britain in 1776, or when John Wayne and the 6th Cavalry blasted away Geronimo and the Apaches in Stagecoach. Colonialism, according to these narratives, is history. The eviction of Oceti Sakowin suggests otherwise. That is almost three times the national average. Schools are failing. Healthcare is inadequate. Many depend on unsafe wells for water. Roads are often unpaved. Housing is in short supply, substandard and overcrowded. If the people of Standing Rock did not take-in their beloved family and friends, there would be mass homelessness. The pipeline will pour even more wealth into his pockets. Meanwhile, Standing Rock will remain in poverty on the margins. The most expensive piece of infrastructure in their community will not be the schools, homes or hospitals they desperately need. Instead it will be a pipeline that they have vehemently opposed. This is how the first people of this land live in the forgotten Bantustans of the American West. This system, an essential foundation of the United States, is rooted in the theft of indigenous land and the ongoing disavowal of indigenous sovereignty. Indigenous presence must be confined, erased and then forgotten, so that the United States may continue to live upon and profit mightily from lands taken from indigenous people. The erasure of indigenous people explains why Dakota Access was rerouted from upstream of Bismarck south to Standing Rock. It explains why pipelines can be hammered through Native communities without regard to their treaties and indigenous, constitutional and human rights. It explains why a multi-billion dollar pipe can be drilled through Standing Rock before long-needed basic infrastructure is built. It explains how, after months of unprecedented protests and visibility, Trump can claim that he received no complaints about the pipeline. It explains how Oceti Sakowin can be wiped off the map. It is impossible to describe the totality of this picture of land theft, containment, poverty, oppression, policing and extraction as anything other than colonialism. They have lit a fire on the prairie in the heart of America as a symbol of their resistance, a movement that stands for something that is undoubtedly right: water that sustains life, and land that gave birth to people. In its ashes there is the potential for a more just future for this land, this water, and all the nations and people who share it.

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Reuters Donald Trump's extensive, international business holdings mean he will have to make decisions as leader of the US that also affect his businesses. Here's a look at some of his potential conflicts of interest. The Trump Organization is an umbrella company for Donald Trump's hundreds of investments in real estate, brands and other businesses. As head of the executive branch and a business owner, he has the ability to influence both US policy and government agencies to benefit his bottom line. Presidents are not subject to the same conflict of interest rules as other government employees, but previous commanders-in-chief have placed their investments into a blind trust to prevent any question of corruption. Ahead of the inauguration, Mr Trump placed his business holdings in a revocable trust managed by his two adult sons, Eric and Donald Jr. But while this removes him from the day-to-day decision making of his business, the president still retains a long-term interest in making sure his companies are doing well. Shortly after, ProPublica reported Mr Trump could draw money from the trust at any time, without external disclosure. Ethics experts have urged Mr Trump to liquidate his business holdings so that he can avoid any appearance of a conflict, as the public nature of most of his businesses means it impossible to prevent him from knowing how government policies will affect his bottom line. Read more here about how the Trump Organization's business works and what it means for the presidency. Below is a list of known conflicts of interest for Mr Trump, both foreign and domestic. Because his business is private, the full extent of his holdings - and the potential for conflicts - is not known. The 60-year lease will likely involve renegotiations - and the person responsible for setting the rent prices would ultimately report to the head of the GSA, a Trump appointee.In addition, the lease bars any federal employee, including elected officials, from benefitting from contracts with the government. The letter was written by the GSA employee who had done the initial negotiations over the building. The letter has not stopped criticism. Bookbinder's organisation sued Mr Trump shortly after he was sworn in over foreign conflicts of interests. Meanwhile, the hotel has already been pitched to foreign diplomats as a place to stay while in Washington, raising concerns that foreign governments could see booking expensive rooms at the Trump International as a way to gain favour with the Trump administration. 40 Wall Street Image copyright Getty Images The Trump Organization owns the right to lease the space in this office building in Manhattan - and makes money from the rent paid to the building. According to Bloomberg News, there are five ongoing federal investigations into current or former tenants of 40 Wall Street, mostly for securities fraud. Those investigations are headed up by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Mr Trump's appointee to head the SEC, Jay Clayton, has been criticised for his ties to Wall Street firms by Democrats during his confirmation hearings. Dakota Access Pipeline Image copyright Getty Images Sioux tribes and allies had protesting for months to prevent the Dakota Access pipeline from being built under water supplies near the Standing Rock reservation. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks says Mr Trump has sold his stock in Energy Transfer Partners. It's unclear if the president has also sold his stock in Phillips 66, as his last financial disclosure was in May 2016. Update: On 24 January, Mr Trump signed an executive order paving the way for final construction of the pipeline. ETP began work in early February and oil is expected to flow by early April. The pipeline remains the subject of a lawsuit by the Cheyenne River Sioux. Deutsche Bank One of Trump's major lenders on his real estate projects is Deutsche Bank. The bank is currently in negotiations with the US justice department to settle a case involving misleading buyers when it sold mortgage bonds backed by risky loans. NBC and its parent company, Comcast, is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Mr Trump's pick for the chairman, Ajit Pai, will be need to be reconfirmed by the Senate this year, in order to continue on at the commission. National Labor Relations Board On 3 November, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled that Trump International Hotel Las Vegas - which Trump co-owns - broke the law by refusing to negotiate with a hotel workers' union. The hotel appealed the case to a higher court. But three other labour disputes involving the Las Vegas hotel are currently before the board, as well as several others involving the Trump Organization. NLRB is facing an unprecedented situation on how to rule on disputes that will affect the president's business. Mr Trump has named current board member Philip Miscimarra as acting chair and will be able to appoint two new members to vacant spots. Secret Service Image copyright Reuters During the campaign, Trump's airplane company, TAG Air, billed the Secret Service for flying on Trump's Boeing 757 while protecting the candidate. It is standard for Secret Service to pay their own way on private aircraft, and during the campaign, this was tracked by the Federal Election Commission through campaign finance reports. While Mr Trump flies on Air Force One and other US aircraft as president, if Trump or Pence family members are assigned protective detail and decide to fly on Trump planes, the Secret Service would need to reimburse TAG Air - and ultimately Mr Trump - for the flights. In addition, Secret Service will reportedly pay the Trump Organization for the space they use in Trump Tower while protecting Melania and Barron Trump as they stay in New York for part of 2017. Secret Service has also paid to protect Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr, as members of the president's family - even as they travel to take care of business for the Trump Organization. Stocks Jason Miller, the transition team's spokesman, has said the president sold all his stocks in June 2016, a month after the required financial disclosure, but the campaign did not furnish proof nor provide an updated list of Mr Trump's investments. Since his election, Mr Trump has singled out specific companies for criticism on Twitter, causing price swings on the stock market. If Mr Trump still owns these stocks, he could make money off of selling and buying before and after such tweets. Foreign holdings According to Trump's financial disclosure, as of mid-2016, he had investments in or owned companies in at least 20 countries. Unlike his domestic business, Mr Trump could run afoul of a clause in the US constitution by continuing to profit from these deals. Even routine business benefits like tax breaks could violate the emoluments clause. In addition to emoluments, Mr Trump's foreign policy decisions could be called into question in any country in which the Trump Organization does business, especially when his policies would benefit the firm's holdings overseas.Here are some of Mr Trump's larger business deals that intersect with US foreign policy. BBC Monitoring contributed to this report Argentina An Argentine broadcaster reported that Mr Trump allegedly asked President Mauricio Macri for his support to build an office tower in Buenos Aires while on call during Mr Trump's transition period. Mr Macri's office and the Trump campaign have denied the report. However, several days later, the Buenos Aires firm building the tower announced construction of the project was going ahead after years of delays. Brazil A waterfront property in Rio de Janeiro, branded with the Trump name through a licensing deal, is the subject of a federal inquiry after two small Brazilian pension funds invested heavily in the unfinished project, with allegations of bribery. Update: The Trump Organization has reportedly cancelled their licensing deal with the developers in Rio. Canada The Trump Organization has licensing deals with two hotel towers in Canada - one in Toronto and one in Vancouver. The Vancouver building is now open, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by the Trump sons, but the Toronto tower is up for auction after the developer went bankrupt and was put into receivership by a Canadian judge in November. China The Bank of China is one of China's largest banks and also majority state-owned. Mr Trump has previously labelled China a currency manipulator. Another largely government-owned Chinese bank - the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China - has space in Trump Tower, paying rent to the Trump Organization. The Trump Organization has also previously attempted to open a series of hotels in the country, and Trump Hotels chief executive Eric Danziger told a Hong Kong media outlet in October they wanted to open 20 to 30 hotels in the country in 2017. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionJared Kushner has a long list of things to do Meanwhile, Trump's son-in-law and now senior adviser, Jared Kushner, was negotiating a deal with China's Anbang Insurance Group to redevelop 666 Fifth Avenue in New York City before backing out of talks in late March. Mr Kushner has been given a senior role inside the White House. Ivanka Trump, who has her own non-paying position at the White House, has advised her father on a broad number of policy areas, including high-profile foreign policy meetings. On the same day she sat next to Chinese President at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago, the Chinese government approved three new trademarks for Ms Trump's firm to sell items in China. While Ms Trump has moved her firm to a trust and said she will not partake in decisions could led to conflicts, ethics experts are concerned with the broadening scope of both her business, which bears her name, and her advisory role at the White House. The firm with developers of a beachfront planned community but the project stalled, and Trump sued in 2012 for unpaid licencing fees. After a settlement of that lawsuit, the developments did not use the Trump name or discuss any involvement with the Trump Organization. Georgia The Trump Organization cancelled a licensing deal to build a condo tower in the resort town of Batumi, Georgia, shortly after Mr Trump won the election. The deal had been originally inked in 2011 but stalled amid slow growth in the country. India Trump has a licensing deal for buildings in Mumbai and Pune. One of his deals is with the Lodha Group, whose founder, Mangal Lodha, is also a vice-president in the ruling government party, BJP. Indonesia Two building projects with Trump licensing and management deals have not begun construction in earnest but the Trump Organization continues to be part of the venture. Mr Trump's partner on the resort projects is Hary Tanoesoedibjo, who ran for vice-president and is well-connected politically in Indonesia. Mr Hary is forming a political party in anticipation of the 2019 elections, the New York Times reports. In addition, one of Trump's advisers, Carl Icahn, is a major shareholder of Freeport, which is looking to extend a mining contract with the Indonesia government. Japan Ivanka Trump sat in with a meeting with her father and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Ms Trump's own firm is currently finalising a licensing deal with Japanese clothing company Sanei International, although she has now stepped down from the firm as well as the Trump Organization. The firm's largest shareholder is the Japanese government through the Development Bank of Japan. Ms Trump's company says the deal has been in the works for a while, and the terms were agreed before the election. Philippines Philippines' newest trade envoy to the United States is the same man who is building Trump Tower Manila. Like many of Trump's branding projects, Mr Trump does not own the building himself, but licenses his name to the building in return for regular payments. Trump family members have previously promoted the project, including a promotional video. Saudi Arabia During the course of the campaign, Trump created eight business ventures tied to a potential real estate deal in Saudi Arabia. However, the firm could easily re-establish business ties there. Taiwan In September, a woman claiming to be an envoy for the Trump Organization discussed potential real estate developments in Taiwan with the mayor of Taoyuan. A month after his election, Trump called the president of Taiwan directly, breaking decades of existing US foreign policy. It still unclear if the woman is connected with the Trump Organization Turkey Image copyright Getty Images In 2008, Trump entered a licensing partnership with Turkish conglomerate Dogan Holdings, who were planning to build two residential and business towers in Istanbul's business district. Relations between Dogan Holdings and Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan have turned sour since the towers opened in 2012. The Dogan family, also own a paper critical of Mr Erdogan. An earlier story from Newsweek argues the poisoned relationship between Mr Erdogan and the Dogans means Mr Trump would have a direct conflict between his business interests and his relationship with a US ally. Turkey's importance in the fight against IS and the Syrian civil war makes the stakes much higher. UK golf courses Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Trump visits the golf course he owns in Aberdeen, Scotland Mr Trump owns two golf courses in Scotland and has recently asked Nigel Farage to oppose wind farms, not because he believed they were bad for the UK or contradicted US energy goals, but because a wind project would potentially lower the value of one of his golf courses. The golf courses could also be affected as part of Brexit negotiations or a second Scottish independence referendum. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

This week's high-profile intervention was not the first time unarmed protesters have encountered police violence. Keene says part of the reason for the strong solidarity among Native tribes across the country is because the dispute over the the pipeline is part of a long-standing fight to have the sovereignty of their nations respected by the US government. These lands that the pipeline is cutting through right now are their homeland from time immemorial.. One advantage, however, is that Native people from the Plains are teaching the folks from warmer climates how to adapt, using lots of traditional methods from bonfires to longhouses. 6.

But then the population began to grow again, as if a plant left to die refused to do so, began to flourish. By 1960 there were 800,000 Indians, half on reservations, half in towns all over the country. I learned to read from school books, newspapers, and the Bible. But in time I found that these were not enough. Civilized people depend too much on man-made printed pages. A Hopi Indian named Sun Chief said: I had learned many English words and could recite part of the Ten Commandments. I knew how to sleep on a bed, pray to Jesus, comb my hair, eat with a knife and fork, and use a toilet. Chief Luther Standing Bear, in his 1933 autobiography, From the Land of the Spotted Eagle, wrote: True, the white man brought great change. But the varied fruits of his civilization, though highly colored and inviting, are sickening and deadening. As the civil rights and antiwar movements developed in the 1960s, Indians were already gathering their energy for resistance, thinking about how to change their situation, beginning to organize. In 1961, five hundred tribal and urban Indian leaders met in Chicago. Out of this came another gathering of university-educated young Indians who formed the National Indian Youth Council. Mel Thorn, a Paiute Indian, their first president, wrote: There is increased activity over on the Indian side. Around this time, Indians began to approach the United States government on an embarrassing topic: treaties. The United States government had signed more than four hundred treaties with Indians and violated every single one. But in the early sixties, under President Kennedy, the United States ignored the treaty and built a dam on this land, flooding most of the Seneca reservation. Resistance was already taking shape in various parts of the country. In the state of Washington, there was an old treaty taking land from the Indians but leaving them fishing rights. This became unpopular as the white population grew and wanted the fishing areas exclusively for themselves. A local judge the following year ruled that the Puyallup tribe did not exist, and its members could not fish on the river named for them, the Puyallup River. Policemen raided Indian fishing groups, destroyed boats, slashed nets, manhandled people, arrested seven Indians. The state continued to get injunctions and to arrest Indians fishing. Protests, raids, arrests, continued into the early seventies. Continue reading.

Distribute. Fallen Warriors Obituaries to fallen warriors. Journal. Newswire Three water protectors and an independent journalist were arrested Saturday on private land and the controversial Bayou Bridge Pipeline now faces more legal trouble for beginning construction on a section of its pipeline route across the Atchafalaya Basin without permission. Theda Wright and her sisters are outraged. They own a 38-acre parcel of cypress forest near Bayou Chene, on the west side of the Atchafalaya Basin and have not given Energy Transfer Partners permission to be there or to destroy their land. Despite pressure from the company, Wright and her sisters have refused to sign a contract granting the pipeline company permission to the roughly 1500-foot easement it has planned for her land. That is a rate of about one penny per foot of pipeline the company hopes to operate across the Wright family land. With permission from the landowners to occupy their property, opponents of the pipeline acted to stop any further destruction of the Wright family land by engineering a skypod, a type of blockade across the property line preventing Bayou Bridge equipment from further destroying the land. The skypod consists of high tension rope that is acting as a life line for a tree-sit platform. If any of the ropes are cut, the platform could fall, endangering the life of the person in the tree and anyone below. Video footage shows ETP workers are continuing to operate heavy machinery within close-proximity of the life line. After the arrests on Saturday, ETP workers began to verbally threaten and pull on the support line, causing the platform to violently shake, further endangering the life of the water protector perched atop. Recently, Water Protectors were snatched from their kayaks in the Intercoastal Waterway by off-duty Department of Corrections officers, who refused to identify themselves, moonlighting as security for ETP. On that day, water protectors were dragged out of their kayaks and dragged onto a fan boat where they were bound by Department of Corrections officers. They are the first to be charged under the Act 692 (formally HB 727) which makes it a felony to be on a pipeline easement while engaging in non-violent direct action against the construction of the Bayou Bridge pipeline.

Books Library Tools Podcast Store CrimethInc. and others, we are calling for a week of solidarity to support everyone targeted for standing up to the Trump regime and rising fascism. These efforts have emboldened dissidents from Slovenia to the White House itself, catalyzing global resistance and destabilizing the Trump administration from within. In response, the authorities are bringing felony charges against hundreds of people and seeking to criminalize protest altogether. How effectively we support arrestees will determine how effectively we can continue resisting. Though these people were arrested simply for happening to be on the same city block, the prosecutor has not dropped or diminished the charges, instead using the court process as a kind of judicial harassment. Since April 2016, when the Sacred Stone camp was founded, there have been nearly 800 arrests in the struggle against the Dakota Access Pipeline. These include state charges ranging from misdemeanor criminal trespass to felony terrorizing and rioting, federal charges against six Indigenous Water Protectors, and an active grand jury convened to investigate the activities of everyone resisting the pipeline. While the camps have been evicted and the people forcibly removed in a militarized operation, resistance continues. California Highway Patrol is recommending that felony charges be brought against 106 alleged participants in the clashes in Sacramento last summer that prevented a fascist rally from taking place. Berkeley police are seeking to bring charges against those who clashed with nationalists on March 4. Meanwhile, Trump and his cronies have been spreading conspiracy theories about protesters, alleging without a shred of evidence that they are being paid to protest. The idea is to delegitimize dissidents by accusing them of the same profit motive that Trump and his cronies are flagrantly pursuing in the full light of day. These outright lies send a message to far-right vigilantes that they will have a free hand to attack demonstrators and dissidents without consequences from the state. At the same time, the legislatures in many states are seeking to pass anti-protest laws to further criminalize anyone who take to the streets in protest. In short, the state is opening a new phase of repression. Having done nothing to protect the black people, Muslims, and Jews targeted in an explosion of racist and anti-Semitic attacks, the state is openly carrying out its own attacks on Middle Eastern refugees and immigrants from Mexico and Central America, and now aims to crush everyone who opposes this. The one-two punch of state repression and vigilante attacks is calculated to destroy social movements, softening up America so Trump can force through his totalitarian agenda. Normalizing Repression What We Can Do Make sure that everyone who has been arrested has all the resources they need to see them through the court process so they can get back out on the street and active again. Below, you can find a list of fundraisers to support arrestees. Set up benefit events to raise funds for the defendants. Organize an event for the upcoming grand jury resistance tour that the Water Protector Anti-Repression Crew from Standing Rock is setting up. Any precedents that are set in repression against protesters will be used against everyone else. Identify key figures responsible for this wave of repression and put direct pressure on them, connecting them with the crackdown on freedom. Make it clear that there will be personal consequences for taking the side of oppression. Drop banners, post fliers, set up educational events, and distribute information about the charges and how to support arrestees. Refuse to cooperate with state investigations and grand juries. Teach people to know their rights, to remain silent when police and federal agents interrogate and threaten them, to support grand jury resisters. Keep fighting. If there is a powerful movement against Trump and the forces he represents, defendants from the previous clashes will be more likely to receive the support they deserve. Keep organizing new efforts against Trump, police, nationalists, and the pipelines and profiteering from which they draw their power. Fundraising Publishing the following links to these support campaigns in no way indicates that the defendants in question endorse this call for solidarity, nor that they have ever been exposed to anarchist politics or this site in particular. The point is simply that everyone swept up in these charges deserves support. We strive to reinvent our lives and our world according to the principles of self-determination and mutual aid.

Officers in North Dakota and South Dakota have pulled over and searched at least four veterans on their way to the camps at Standing Rock in recent days, charging two of them for medical cannabis. The charges against two veterans, who said they use medical cannabis to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, come days after a veterans service organization announced it would be returning to Standing Rock to provide support. News of the charges adds to growing concerns that law enforcement is aggressively monitoring, arresting and prosecuting people affiliated with the anti-pipeline movement. The Guardian recently reported that an FBI terrorism task force has attempted to contact at least three people tied to the demonstrations. Matthew Crane, one of five founding members of VeteransRespond, was pulled over last Friday night when he was arriving to Standing Rock with two other vets and a fourth passenger. The group got lost on a closed road, he said, and they were trying to find officers to get directions. The 33-year-old navy veteran said he has a disability stemming from his service and that the roughly one gram of medical marijuana he had on him came from Washington DC, where cannabis is legal. He lives in New York, where medical cannabis is also legal. On Thursday, police in Mobridge, South Dakota, arrested two individuals that officials claimed were VeteransRespond members. Sanderson, however, said they were not members, although one of them, Travis Biolette, is now loosely affiliated with the group, which is assisting him in his charges. A police search found hash oil, which is classified as a controlled substance in South Dakota. Biolette and his friend were taken to jail in Selby, South Dakota. In a phone interview Monday night, Biolette said he spent four nights in jail and was released earlier in the day. He said that police pulled him over for speeding about six miles above the limit and that when he revealed he was going to Standing Rock, the officer launched a search. He said the hash oil is his prescribed medication, which he uses for PTSD and major depressive disorder. Biolette, who is now getting support from VeteransRespond members who picked him up from jail, said police still have his vehicle with all of his possessions, including his cold-weather clothing. Nonetheless, he was still planning on Monday night to go to Standing Rock, which he also visited last year. VeteransRespond has said it intends to help Standing Rock leaders on camp with a range of responsibilities, including cleanup efforts, kitchen help and medical aid. The Mobridge police department could not be reached for comment. Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome. They will do the bidding of the real rich. It's going to be real bloody, unfortunately. The genetic memories of genocide enacted on our First People Relatives, here on Mother Earth, have been awakened, and WE ARE RAW. I am supremely proud of our Standing Rock Relatives, and ALL who joined with them, to stand in prayer, both on-site and off, for the Greater Good of All. I find it extremely ironic that by doing so, their actions are being threatened by those who are blatantly breaking the first laws of our land: the right to assembly, the right to speak one's Truth without fear of retribution, the right to pray according to one's faith. But what is happening is that, by the oil and money mongers bulldozing their way through broken treaties and trails of blood, not only are we First Nations coming together, but so also are All Nations of the World. They know what they're up against, and I think they are up to the job. They rounded up people planning to protest at the Republican Party Convention back in 2004. Needless to say, surveillance and targeting are even more precise today. I'm in no position to make this argument, but it looks like disbanding the protests after President Obama issued a temporary halt was a bad move.

The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAP), a project of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, a private enterprise, has an estimated cost of 3.78 billion dollars and an extension of 1,172 miles. It would transport approximately half a million barrels per day of fracked crude oil from the Bakken shale fields in northwest North Dakota, to a refinery near Chicago, Illinois. The affected indigenous communities have fought the pipeline through the courts, so far unsuccessfully, and, for about 8 months, by non-violent protest. During the past few months, the movement has been joined by representatives of more than 100 Native American and Canadian tribes, as well as by people from the country at large. The implementation of the Dakota Access Pipeline Project has already led to police violence. Arbitrary arrests and intimidation of detainees by strip searches and incarceration have become frequent. The indigenous tribes involved see the pipeline itself as a violation of the human rights of original peoples to protect their territories, cemeteries and sacred sites as well as their right to clean water that would possibly be contaminated by pipeline leaks. The DAP project violates international treaties, signed by the United States, which stipulate the rights of indigenous peoples to their territories and to previous informed consent to projects that affect these territories. For the Sioux and other affected tribes, this project represents one more egregious violation of the historical treaties with the U.S. government that have been abrogated in the interest of private ventures. We, the indigenous peoples and campesinos of Mexico are suffering the same menace from government-supported megaprojects in the form of hydroelectric dams, contamination of our native corn varieties, open pit mining projects, and wind farms, which threaten to take over our legally-held lands and natural resources. In the face of these current political realities, we extend a call to create bonds of unity between indigenous peoples, activists, networks and movements of international solidarity among all peoples who resist this economic model and its megaprojects, with a view to guaranteeing respect for the human rights of the defenders of water and earth, and to upholding the rights of original peoples. We manifest our categorical rejection of the violent acts of harassment and repression provoked by the imposition of the Dakota Access Pipeline. We manifest ourselves in favor of the lives and well-being of the Native Peoples of the American continents, as well as of the rights of original peoples to conserve our water, our forests, our mountains and plains, and our spiritual relationship with the land. We stand in solidarity with the Sioux Nation of Standing Rock in its defense of its territory, water, and cultural identity.

In 1934, mill owners announced they would be cutting wages, and the girls began meeting to discuss how they should respond. When owners fired one of their leaders, 800 young women walked out on strike. Two years later, the owners announced another wage cut. In response, the young women walked out together and formed the Factory Girls Association and later, the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association. After two tumultuous weeks, the strike was successful. The publishers agreed to roll back the price increases and to take back unsold papers at a full refund. Read more.

Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066, which ordered 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry to be forcefully removed and imprisoned in internment (concentration) camps. At Tule Lake in California, thirty-five teenagers protested by refusing to turn in their surveys. They were arrested and taken to jail at gunpoint. To address the poor facilities at the segregated high school she attended in Farmville, Virginia, sixteen-year-old Barbara Rose Johns decided to take action. She assembled student council members and made a plan to go on strike. On April 23, 1951, Johns and her fellow students went on strike to protest the substandard conditions at Robert Russa Moton High School. As a result, NAACP lawyers met with students and the community and filed a lawsuit at the federal courthouse in Richmond, Virginia. The case was called Davis v. Prince Edward, and it became one of the five cases that the U.S. Supreme Court reviewed in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka when it declared school segregation unconstitutional.

Veterans, water protectors and the independent media facing riot police. Photo by Rob Wilson. Mark Trahant posted Feb 24, 2017 Every day I write rhymes on Twitter. I get a kick out of reducing complicated ideas and events down to 140 characters. But think about that story: A few dozen people were arrested at camps where more than 10,000 people once said no to the Dakota Access pipeline. That people power did not evaporate. Even today more people, tens of thousands, perhaps millions, are still a part of that effort via social media and through direct action. This is a narrative that the state of North Dakota, the pipeline company, and the oil industry could not counter, despite spending millions of dollars and advancing into Great Sioux treaty lands with a law enforcement army. The company was in a rush to build and North Dakota made the story more compelling by acting against its own interest. In August, Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier arrested Standing Rock Chairman David Archambault II and the plot raced ahead to a military occupation, a company line to defend, and a global audience via social media. Lots of drama. Now the pipeline is set and oil will flow. Perhaps in a few days. They won. But this is not the only fight about water. There are now hundreds of scenes spread across North America. The protection of water, the rebalancing of the world, now has a symbol and a memory to carry that story forward. This is not the only fight about water. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe hopes supporters on March 10 will march and pray in Washington, D.C. I think people will go. And by the thousands. Standing Rock is the call to action. The White House tried to rewrite the story Thursday. The idea here, which has been brewing for a while, is to cast the tribe as a partner of the state. The tribe immediately called out that statement as false. I was on a plane to Washington, D.C., when the easement was issued. It was an insult to me and to the Tribe. I cancelled the meeting upon hearing this news. This lie from the White House is revealing: The Trump administration (and its allies in the oil industry and North Dakota) understands that this story is not over. They want their narrative back.

In preparation, we've been helping plan the next international day of action targeting banks to divest from the dangerous project. Today, Bank DNB announced it is going to sell its assets in the Dakota Access Pipeline project. Original petition text: Over 100 water protectors were brutally arrested by Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) security forces -- some locked in dog kennels and shot at with rubber bullets and pepper spray -- just for standing up for their ancestral lands and our most precious resource, water. Thousands have peacefully gathered in person and in solidarity to stop this 570,000 barrel-per-day pipeline that would endanger the water and ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. And while this inspiring work is going on, the banks that we use every day are backing the project with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and investment each. Demand your bank to stop financially supporting from the Dakota Access Pipeline and associated projects such as Energy Transfer now. North Dakota recorded nearly 300 oil pipeline spills in less than two years -- and none were disclosed to the public. The DAPL was originally going to be routed near the city of Bismarck -- but was rejected because it would have run so close to municipal water sources. Bank DNB, BBVA, TD, Wells Fargo, Mizuho Bank, BayernLB, Citibank, ING, Deutsche Bank, RBC, Credit Suisse, UBS, Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole, Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, and ABN Amro Capital all support the project financially. These banks are vulnerable to public pressure. We are their customers and shareholders -- and they need our business. Stop the money, stop a pipeline. Tell your bank to stop funding the project now. What we are bearing witness to at Standing Rock is a moment of history. We can't all be in North Dakota, but we can all stand in solidarity with those who are. Which is why after you sign the petition, we will list other ways you can support to help the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. This community is powerful when it comes together. Now, we need to come together now and help the Standing Rock Sioux stop the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. The War and Peace Report. Their resistance has been met by increasing repression by hundreds of police officers from North Dakota and surrounding states, as well as by unlicensed pipeline security guards, who unleashed dogs and pepper spray against Native American protectors on September 3rd. The original charge against me was criminal trespass. Police have begun deploying military-grade equipment, including armored personnel carriers, surveillance helicopters, planes and drones. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple activated the National Guard in late September. Roughly 140 people have been arrested. This is Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, a pediatrician on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: When I was taken to the jail, first I was taken by a corrections officer, transported from the protest site to the Morton County jail. And then, when they took me in there, you know, they had to take some basic information. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: No, not a cavity search, but I had to squat and cough. I had to squat and cough and then put the orange suit on. DR. SARA JUMPING EAGLE: Yeah, I was put in an orange jumpsuit. And then I was held there for several hours. But I was in there for several hours. DR. She was charged with disorderly conduct. LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, who founded the first resistance camp, the Sacred Stone Camp, on her own land April 1st, says her daughter was recently arrested, taken into custody at the Morton County jail, strip-searched in front of multiple male officers, then left for hours in her cell, naked and freezing, before the guards finally gave her clothes to wear. Cody Hall from Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota says he was also strip-searched after he was arrested Friday, September 9th, held for three days without bail or bond, and then charged with two misdemeanors. CODY HALL: As I exited out of the vehicles and entered Morton County, I came up an elevator, and as the elevator opened up, I was met with state police. You know, they had my arms. They, you know, kind of like extend your arms out. And they have you, you know, lift up your genitals and bend over, you know, cough. CODY HALL: Yes, yes, I sat in the court office in my orange jumpsuit, locked, you know, still handcuffed, exited out of the courtroom. And then they literally had a line from the courtroom to the door that connects you to the county jail. And my mother walked out with me. And as we got to the door, they were opening the door up. And as I looked behind me, my mother and I, all of the cops then proceeded to kind of swarm, you know, like make, you know, that big wall as I entered in, which was, again, an overkill, you know, but that, too, though, to show a dominant force. AMY GOODMAN: That was Cody Hall, who was arrested on two misdemeanors, held for four days, strip-searched here at the Morton County jail just behind us. Winona LaDuke, Native American activist, executive director of the group Honor the Earth, she lives and works on the White Earth Reservation in northern Minnesota. She is Ojibwe from the Couchiching First Nation. We have spoken to you intermittently through this resistance. Right now there is about 900,000 barrels per day of oil coming out of this state, and they project that into 2019. AMY GOODMAN: The Dakota Excess. WINONA LADUKE: Dakota Excess pipeline. This is really about spites. Total misuse of the law, you know, and the president really needs to intervene and uphold the law. AMY GOODMAN: Tara Houska, you have been following these protests and the level of militarization in response to the protests. You were there on Saturday. We spoke to you at one of these peaceful marches of hundreds of Native Americans. These are women and children that are out there. They had Native Americans out there praying for the land. They put a tipi up in front of the actual pipeline route, and they called that a riot. AMY GOODMAN: Well, all for this pipeline. And Enbridge and Marathon Oil just bought a third of this pipeline. WINONA LADUKE: We fought them in northern Minnesota. We defeated that pipeline, and they came out here and moved out here. This is pretty much the Deep North. And in the meantime, Indian arrests have been consistent. Native people are treated like, you know, third-class citizens. And, you know, the governor is acting like this is Mississippi up here, and you can just do that. And now people are finally noticing. AMY GOODMAN: You know, after Ferguson, the whole country saw the level of militarization of local police departments. TARA HOUSKA: We did. You know, indigenous women went up there, and we offered the police water, sage and sweet grass, and, you know, trying to show that we are peaceful, that we are doing this for not only our children, but their children, too. This is a people issue. Water is a people issue. AMY GOODMAN: I want to talk about this issue of strip-searching, Winona. It is astounding to hear that even people, like the pediatrician for Standing Rock, Dr. Sara Jumping Eagle, was strip-searched for disorderly conduct. WINONA LADUKE: I would say that, generally, North Dakota is not good to Native people and is really behind the times in terms of constitutional and civil rights. You know, I mean, for many, many years, our people have had an undue burden of the legal system against them, and nobody has really paid attention. But it is wrong. TARA HOUSKA: I think that this state is reading the law as broadly as it can when it comes to violating the constitutional rights to free speech of these people. That matters more than any, you know, criminal trespass or these, you know, attempts to suppress and keep our voices down. These are U.S. citizens that are all here standing together. TARA HOUSKA: And seeing, I mean, local schools doing, you know, lockdowns when these protests are happening. AMY GOODMAN: This has just started happening. And the fact is, is that the people that are out here, you know, are trying to protect the water. And this is a chance to protect that water. AMY GOODMAN: There are a lot of people concerned that this is escalating to a very bad situation. WINONA LADUKE: Yes, I am concerned that they escalating it. Our people have consistently been praying. Our people have been consistently engaged in nonviolent direct action. And, you know, we had a forum in Bismarck this last week, and it was very well attended, because I think people in Bismarck want to know why all these cops are out there, what is going on, you know, why these people are coming in here. You know, it affects all of us. So, you know, it is time to say our civil rights, our constitutional rights are all being violated. WINONA LADUKE: That is right. I also have to say hello to my grandchildren and my children. Hearings are starting on that. So, I have to face that. And they are not going to get Line 3. And so they should move on. Do something real. I mean, North Dakota is a very rural state. And the police are a scary presence. And we see a Congress that deregulates the oil industry again and again and again. AMY GOODMAN: That was Tara Houska, national campaigns director for Honor the Earth. She is Ojibwe from the Couchiching First Nation. And before that, Anishinaabe activist Winona LaDuke, co-founder of Honor the Earth. Well, only hours after that broadcast, I learned Judge John Grinsteiner had refused to sign off on the riot charges against me, a major victory for press freedom. But since that victory, protectors and journalists have continued to get arrested in North Dakota. More than 400 people have been arrested. Stay with us.

Elsewhere, a group of Korean-American elected officials sent President Trump a letter calling for diplomacy and dialogue. This is President Trump, speaking to reporters at his private golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey.

Gorka was speaking Tuesday on MSNBC. You have to check them. You have to find out who the perpetrators are. The Jewish newspaper The Forward reports Gorka has links to a Hungarian far-right, Nazi-allied group and supported an anti-Semitic and racist paramilitary militia in Hungary while he served as a Hungarian politician. This is President Trump speaking to reporters from inside his private golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey. The North also detailed its threat to strike Guam, saying it would launch four intermediate-range missiles into the waters off the U.S. territory. The bizarre incidents began last fall, when workers at the U.S. Embassy in Havana began complaining of headaches and deafness. Many were forced to leave their posts early due to their illnesses. U.S. intelligence officials concluded the hearing loss was due to a sonic device operating outside the range of audible sound, which was likely planted in or around the homes of the diplomats. On Thursday, Canada said at least one of its Havana-based diplomats was treated for hearing loss, as well. Some are talking about a possible third-country involvement. Topics: Cuba Russia: Journalist Jailed over Calls for Political Accountability Aug 11, 2017 In Russia, a court sentenced investigative journalist Alexander Sokolov to a three-and-a-half-year prison term Thursday, after he called for a referendum to make politicians more accountable. This is Alexander Sokolov speaking to reporters from inside a courthouse cage, after his sentencing. And a grave crime has been committed against us, which is hindering the referendum. It is obvious that the people of Russia are prohibited from assessing the actions of those in power.

This is Kimberly, a transgender woman from Honduras, speaking Wednesday at the U.S.-Mexico border. The mistreatment against us begins in our families, when they run us from our homes. They take us out of our homes because we are trans girls. Many of us have been abused by gang members, even by the security forces. Members of the LGBTQ migrant caravan called on supporters to call ICE to ask immigration officials to release the activists on humanitarian parole while their claims for asylum are processed. Topics: LGBT Latin America Immigrant Rights Yemen: Human Smugglers Intentionally Drown African Migrants at Sea Aug 11, 2017 In the Arabian Sea, the U.N.'s migration agency says scores of migrants are missing and feared drowned, after a pair of incidents in which human smugglers ordered migrants off their boats and into the roiling ocean off the coast of Yemen. On Thursday, the International Organization for Migration said at least 19 migrants were presumed dead after smugglers pushed them into the sea away from the coast in an effort to avoid Saudi-led patrols off the coast of Yemen. Thursday's incident came a day after another smuggler ordered 120 passengers off his boat, many of whom drowned. This is Laurent de Boeck of the International Organization for Migration. Most of the migrants were from Somalia and Ethiopia and were seeking to travel through Yemen to Gulf states. Topics: Yemen Immigration Ethiopia Somalia Ethiopia: Intense Drought Has Millions on Brink of Starvation Aug 11, 2017 In Ethiopia, the charity Oxfam warns an intense drought has pushed another 700,000 people to the verge of starvation. The U.N. warns that climate change has made droughts in the Horn of Africa far more common, leading to food shortages like a 2011 famine that killed as many as 260,000 people. NOAA also measured record high levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, reaching nearly 403 parts per million. Scientists say climate change has led to less surface water in those parts of Greenland not covered in ice. The pipeline, which was resurrected in March by President Trump, has faced years of resistance from Native Americans, farmers, ranchers and environmentalists. The arrests came as about 200 protesters gathered to denounce a conference between Goldman Sachs and pipeline and fossil fuel corporations. There are pipelines underneath us right now. There are pipelines being built right now. The nature is being harmed by pipelines right now. This is something that we are living. Again, five people were arrested at the nonviolent civil disobedience outside the Goldman Sachs pipeline conference.

The example that we have set today can be a beacon of hope to activists all around the country, looking to change the economic calculus of corporations who think that investing in the Dakota Access Pipeline will be good for their bottom line. I want to acknowledge the victories that have already been achieved. The real power of this ordinance is that it can be used as a tool by movements to put real financial pressure on Big Business by first putting pressure on politicians. And what an honor it is to have been part of this inspiring movement. We had a little snow in Seattle yesterday, but that is nothing compared to the images of the courageous people in Standing Rock who battled blizzards to hold the line against the oil lobby and against banks. That is truly inspiring. Some of you have personally traveled to Standing Rock to join the protests. Others have demonstrated in solidarity here, through our NoDAPL Seattle movement, and together we are building the power of regular people to fight to take our world back from Trump, the billionaires, and the oil lobby. I want to thank all of you. But I still wanted to name a few names. But special thanks to Matt Remle, Millie Kennedy, Alec Connon, Rebecca Deutsch, Rachel Heaton, Ray Kingfisher, Paul Wagner and Jesse Ross, all activists and leaders from the Indigenous community. My fellow activist, Nikkita Oliver, who has made this important recognition that the struggles of all oppressed peoples are united. Thanks also to my staff member, Ted Virdone, who many of you know, and Rachel gave a gift for him, too, which I have accepted on his behalf, and which I will be conveying to him soon. This further shows that the rights of workers as a whole, and the survival of the labor movement, is so tied to the fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, the fight for black and brown rights, and the fight against climate change. Thanks to everyone who has sacrificed, sweated, and bled to build this movement. And I want to thank the Indigenous community as a whole for showing so clearly to all of us that our fight for our planet is paramount. That is, in my view, completely irrational. And nowhere is that more starkly visible then with the big banks and oil companies. In any rational world, the trillions that are in the hands of multinational oil companies would not be used to lobby for wars in Iraq and pipelines poisoning our water and climate. If we had any democracy over our economy, those trillions would be used to transform the energy infrastructure into renewables and to create decent living standards for all human beings. But, sisters and brothers, it is not a rational world under capitalism. So our fight today is very much linked to our larger fight against Big Business, against Wall Street, against Trump and the Billionaire Class, and against capitalism itself. When we build movements to challenge the status quo, and when these movements are powerful enough that they force corporate politicians to take a stand in favor of the movement when it is not their instinct, that is radical. Fighting against the status quo is radical."}, {"URL": "https://act.credoaction.com/sign/defund_dapl?sp_ref=259573280.4.177748.t.563991.2&referring_akid=.1572280.AWxM8&source=tw_sp", "Timestamp": "20180918223342", "Sentences": "You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities.

In preparation, we've been helping plan the next international day of action targeting banks to divest from the dangerous project. Today, Bank DNB announced it is going to sell its assets in the Dakota Access Pipeline project. Original petition text: Over 100 water protectors were brutally arrested by Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) security forces -- some locked in dog kennels and shot at with rubber bullets and pepper spray -- just for standing up for their ancestral lands and our most precious resource, water. Thousands have peacefully gathered in person and in solidarity to stop this 570,000 barrel-per-day pipeline that would endanger the water and ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux. And while this inspiring work is going on, the banks that we use every day are backing the project with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans and investment each. Demand your bank to stop financially supporting from the Dakota Access Pipeline and associated projects such as Energy Transfer now. North Dakota recorded nearly 300 oil pipeline spills in less than two years -- and none were disclosed to the public. The DAPL was originally going to be routed near the city of Bismarck -- but was rejected because it would have run so close to municipal water sources. Bank DNB, BBVA, TD, Wells Fargo, Mizuho Bank, BayernLB, Citibank, ING, Deutsche Bank, RBC, Credit Suisse, UBS, Scotiabank, Royal Bank of Scotland, Societe Generale, Credit Agricole, Credit Agricole, BNP Paribas, SunTrust, Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, and ABN Amro Capital all support the project financially. These banks are vulnerable to public pressure. We are their customers and shareholders -- and they need our business. Stop the money, stop a pipeline. Tell your bank to stop funding the project now. What we are bearing witness to at Standing Rock is a moment of history. We can't all be in North Dakota, but we can all stand in solidarity with those who are. Which is why after you sign the petition, we will list other ways you can support to help the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. This community is powerful when it comes together. Now, we need to come together now and help the Standing Rock Sioux stop the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Overzealous law enforcement officials in North Dakota have jailed journalists and celebrities who were exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech and the press by documenting police attacks on protesters.

The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of over 200 other tribes from across the Americas are leading the resistance to protect sovereign land and drinking water from destruction by the fossil fuel industry. However, in an attempt to quell these historic nonviolent protests, Gov. Dalrymple ordered a state of emergency that has militarized the police force, set up a highway roadblock and mobilized the National Guard to intimidate protesters.

Standing Rock people are protecting the water; they are not just protesting. To protect something means to keep it safe from harm; to protest means to make an objection.

Furthermore, the fact that Americans and other peoples have joined the Standing Rock protectors does not change the fact that the protectors are making a stand on behalf of Creation. John Trudell said long ago that struggles for water would resonate far more strongly with non-Natives than struggles for land. He said everyone has connections with water every day, no matter how high they may live in a city; but many people have no connection to land, other than as real estate. Standing Rock has shown how prescient John was. There was no big gathering last year in Apache country when the U.S. gave Oak Flats to Rio Tinto. Many are celebrating the U.S. Army decision to require a full environmental impact statement for the proposed Dakota Access pipeline crossing of the Missouri River. But the moment requires continued vigilance and clarity about the basic issue: Indigenous self-determination. One would expect from these statements that Treuer would be especially careful about his choice of words in writing about Standing Rock. Indigenous sovereignty struggles are not the same as ordinary American politics. Treuer knows civil rights are different from treaty rights. If you are a close reader, you see he fell into the very confusion of language against which he argued in the Washington Post article about language and sovereignty. We are united by the legacy, and current practices, of colonialism. But the point that needs to be made involves the question of what the leaders fight for. In the end, Treuer failed to clarify that Indian leaders have to fight for Indian self-determination. But the two forms of rights remain separate. When we confuse Treaty rights with civil rights under U.S. law, we undermine the clarity needed to stand up for Indigenous self-determination. What remains unaddressed is the true history of Indian Country, which is to say the true history of the United States: a story of abrogated treaties, of tribal sovereignty limited by Congressional law and of specious Supreme Court decisions, all of which have either hampered or destroyed the ability of tribal people to govern themselves as political sovereigns on their own land. It is this history that created a set of systems that keep tribal nations locked in a suffocating political and economic limbo. American Indians are not minorities in any traditional sense.

On February 22, the Oceti Oyate camp, formerly known as Oceti Sakowin, as well as all other camps on treaty land claimed by the US Army Corps, were ordered to evacuate by 2pm. Hundreds flocked back to Standing Rock to pray as the company resumed drilling under the Missouri River following the granting of the final easement by the US Army Corps on February 7th. Ten unarmed water protectors were arrested and one was badly injured in a violent crackdown. Several of those arrested were journalists and legal observers, clearly targeted for their role in documenting police violence and rights violations. One water protector was tazed Fires kept law enforcement from entering the camps, but they continue to build presence at Standing Rock, preparing to forcibly remove water protectors from unceded territory affirmed in the 1851 and 1868 Ft. Laramie Treaties as sovereign land of the Great Sioux Nation. A contingent of nearly two dozen National Park Service rangers and U.S. Park Police officers arrived at the request of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe with tactical gear ranging from gas masks and riot gear to rifles, protective vests, and night vision goggles. The Sacred Stone Camp is standing ground, but raids on the remaining camps could happen at any moment. If you witnessed an arrest today at Standing Rock, are arrested, or are concerned about the possible arrest of a relative or loved one, please call the legal jail support line: 605.519.8180. With law enforcement preparing to advance, the legal teams are standing by (Freshet Collective and Water Protector Legal Collective - www.waterprotectorlegal.org ) and will continue to work around the clock to support and stand in solidarity with water protectors. Over 700 water protectors are now fighting criminal cases, and North Dakota is handing down convictions. Six people face federal charges, which carry sentences of up to 15 years. At least one grand jury is active and issuing indictments. Federal agents are knocking on doors at the homes of water protectors and their families. Meanwhile, reactionary legislation targeting water protectors continues to advance through the North Dakota House and Senate. The legal defense of those needing support is going to take a long time, possibly years, and will be very expensive. We are very grateful for your support. The runners delivered 140,000 petition signatures to the US Army Corps of Engineers and rallied at the White House to ask President Obama to pressure them to repeal the water crossing permits. The threats this pipeline poses to the environment, public health, and tribal and human rights are strikingly similar to those posed by the Keystone XL. We are not expendable.

Thousands of them. Native Americans and military veterans. Environmentalists. Police from nine states. Movie stars. Cattle ranchers and lumberjacks, college students and nurses, landscapers, investment bankers and a waitress from a Florida restaurant called Smokey Bones. All have been drawn by a 30-inch steel pipe that, in the unlikely setting of a desolate North Dakota prairie, has become a powerful symbol of heritage and history, progress and oppression, indigenous rights and corporate might. Walking and working the land, each brings a personal history and set of values to a conflict many see as pitting sovereign rights against corporate might. It is more than 90 percent complete. Now, nearly 2,000 are living in tents, tepees, yurts, RVs and cars. They are native and non-native, elderly and newborns. The camp has become so large and permanent that it has a book-swap library and a medical center. More than 560 people have been arrested in protests that have spread 40 miles north to the capital, Bismarck. Each side blames the other for the increasing violence. Protesters claim police have brutalized them with tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, concussion grenades and water cannons. North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple (R) and the Army Corps of Engineers have ordered protesters out of the camp, but they vow to remain. With the first snows of a bleak North Dakota winter threatening, The Washington Post visited the area to record the personal accounts of people on all sides of an issue that is tearing at the American heartland. In Native American culture, dreams can be prophetic. The black snake in this case, he said, is a pipeline filled with oil. On a cold November morning, Goldtooth sat next to a warm wood stove in a canvas tent and described the struggle in flowing indigenous imagery: the four cycles of life, the sacred hoop and the importance of circles in nature, the spiritual power of eagles and grizzly bears. Then his words turned sledgehammer blunt. Goldtooth sees the pipeline as a threat to the drinking water of thousands downstream. Goldtooth was raised on a Navajo reservation in New Mexico, the grandson of a tribal medicine man and the son of a pioneering Navajo woman who earned a college degree in microbiology. Now he travels the world speaking about climate change, energy, pollution and sustainable resources. Goldtooth lives in Minnesota but has been coming to Standing Rock to visit relatives since he was a young man. He has become a key face of the movement here, and one recent morning he nodded as Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an environmental activist and lawyer, visited and likened the pipeline encampment to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. The same day, Goldtooth stood in an empty field amid a circle of volunteer architects, engineers and builders who had come from as far as Spokane, Wash., and Santa Fe, N.M., to help build a more permanent camp to ride out the bone-cracking winter. Play Video Replay video or Read story Cory Bryson Local union official Cory Bryson watched as 200 demonstrators marched through his home town of Bismarck, protesting the project being built by his union workers. But one young man suddenly tried to push his way through the line of riot police, who threw him to the ground and cuffed him. over and over and spat at the officers. Bryson shook his head. To him, it was obvious the man had provoked arrest, for the benefit of the news cameras. Bryson, 32, is business manager for Local 563 of the Laborers International Union, a second-generation union member and a North Dakotan. Moving the Bakken field shale oil to market by pipeline is safer and more efficient than moving it by rail, he said. It has created at least 3,000 good-paying jobs in the past couple of years and will provide maintenance work well into the future. From the beginning, Bryson has gone to observe the protests in this capital city of 67,000. People have put dirt into gas tanks of heavy machinery, smashed windshields and committed other acts of vandalism, reports confirmed by local police. He himself received an anonymous email that included a photo of himself, his wife and his three small children taken from his Facebook page and his home address. He turned it over to police. He is sympathetic to concerns about burial grounds and water purity but said that he thinks the project still can be completed safely and sensitively. Bryson said about 15 of his union members working on the pipeline were Standing Rock Sioux from the reservation. He kept his eyes on protesters and police outside the federal office building. One carried a gun for firing tear-gas canisters. A heavily armored SWAT vehicle sat a half-block away. The young woman, a waitress from Florida, chose kitchen duty, so Obom sent her to a nearby tent to help prepare meals. Obom arrived here in early November, driving 25 hours in her Dodge minivan from Olympia, Wash., to join a movement she had been monitoring on social media, which was making her increasingly upset. She is among thousands of other non-indigenous people from around the country and world who have been drawn to Standing Rock. They chop firewood, build tepees, pick up trash, paint protest banners, help with recycling and composting, and attend training sessions on indigenous rights. Obom was raised in North Carolina and Washington state, and both of her parents deployed to the Middle East in Operation Desert Storm. She was deeply influenced by her mother, who was an ardent environmentalist. She soon found a gift for organizing. Now she was sleeping on the hard-packed ground in her small REI tent, pitched next to the tepee and campfire of an indigenous family that had taken her in. He said that he has been hit with rocks fired from slingshots and chunks of firewood, and he has seen protesters pelting officers with bags of urine and feces. Own it. The square-shouldered, 6-foot-3 deputy works the overnight shift, which until August usually meant handling bar fights and traffic accidents. Now, the department is consumed with confronting pipeline protests, helped by police reinforcements from as far away as Louisiana. Protesters in Mandan, N.D., face off with police during a rally against plans to pass the Dakota Access Pipeline on Nov. 15. That night, police used fire hoses to douse protesters in subfreezing temperatures, sending several to the hospital. A 21-year-old woman suffered severe damage to her left arm. Protesters, and her family, said that she was hit with a concussion grenade, a weapon that creates a loud sound designed to disorient people. Police said that they do not use those devices and that the woman was probably injured by a propane tank the protesters were trying to use as an improvised explosive device. Each side accuses the other of lying about the incident. Moll, who said that he was hit on the helmet by a rock that night, defended the measures as justified. Moll spent his teenage years in Philadelphia, where his father entered the Lutheran seminary, and in Yonkers, N.Y., where his father preached. He graduated from Norwich University, a military school in Vermont, thinking that he would enlist in the military. But instead he gravitated back to the Midwest and enrolled in a North Dakota police academy. Play Video Replay video or Read story Faith Gemmill Native American activist from Alaska Faith Gemmill needed to feed 30 hungry protesters, so she looked over the dinner options: Mason jars filled with moose heart. Reindeer sausage. Dried Caribou and salmon. She and 13 other Native American women had carried that homemade food in coolers and boxes on a four-flight, 10-hour odyssey from their home in Arctic Village, Alaska. Gemmill came here in early November from her tiny village, 500 miles north of Anchorage, to join the encampment. She had seen news coverage of clashes between protesters and police and felt ill over what she considered another violent indignity against native people. Her solution: bring women. Since her early 20s, Gemmill has worked against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and other areas, and she sees the Dakota Access Pipeline as a dangerous over-reliance on fossil fuels that is exacerbating climate change. Gemmill was born in Arctic Village, population 150, and raised in a culture of protecting natural resources. She returned home and started programs to make sure young people were aware of their heritage, and she quickly became a rising star in tribal efforts to protect the local environment. Gemmill said that she and the other Alaska women joined a recent protest on a local highway, where they sang and drummed and prayed. Some young men in the group walked onto land owned by the pipeline developers, and, she said, they were quickly surrounded by needlessly aggressive police who sprayed them with mace. Gemmill knows the political climate in the United States is shifting sharply against her, with the election of Trump, who has vowed to lift restrictions on oil and gas producers and who is invested in an oil company that has a 25 percent stake in the pipeline.

Deer season was winding down, and he was itching to get his buck. But after five hours of tromping through the blustery prairie, he was ready for a mushroom and Swiss burger and a pile of fries. To get to the only restaurant out here, in St. Anthony, he and a buddy drove 15 miles down a gravel road, crossing over a 30-foot wide gash in the vast plains running straight as a ruler for as far as the eye could see. Brown, a burly, bearded 30-year-old in a black ball cap, said the increasing protests are costing local people money. He is a foreman for a local excavating company and said the day before, protesters tried to burn a truck on railroad tracks crossing the road to the gravel pit where he needed to pick up a load of rock. This is how these people support their families. Sitting in a restaurant with walls decorated with huge racks of antlers and other trophy heads, Brown said shipping shale oil by rail has overloaded lines and made it harder for farmers to get their wheat and other crops to market.

Overzealous law enforcement officials in North Dakota have jailed journalists and celebrities who were exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech and the press by documenting police attacks on protesters. These actions are a serious affront to the Constitution and sovereign tribal rights and are an egregious abuse of power by the police and government in order to protect the fossil fuel industry. Tell North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple and the U.S. Department of Justice: Stop police abuse and protect the Constitution, not the fossil fuel industry. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of over 200 other tribes from across the Americas are leading the resistance to protect sovereign land and drinking water from destruction by the fossil fuel industry. However, in an attempt to quell these historic nonviolent protests, Gov.

Truthdig editorial assistant Clara Romeo captured the following images from the rally: The Mohawk Warrior Society flag waves in front of the U.S. Capitol. The influx of people to Standing Rock as winter arrives has been an enormous strain on local resources due to the inherent challenges and dangers of travel and camping in this climate and, in many cases, a lack of necessary knowledge, skills, and experience on the part of those who have traveled to join us. Also, the closure of Highway 1806 and the twisted media portrayals of the camp have essentially acted as economic sanctions against the tribe, denying revenue to an already impoverished nation with a long list of urgent social problems. We ask anyone that is considering traveling to join the encampments at Standing Rock to stay home for now and instead take bold action in your local communities to force investors to divest from the project. We also support those who choose to stay, if they are able to live comfortably and self-sufficiently through a winter in the Great Plains. We support the Sacred Stone Camp, the original encampment established in opposition to the pipeline back on April 1st, 2016. Rest assured, LaDonna is not going anywhere. But due to limited space and infrastructure, there is no longer an open call for people to come join Sacred Stone Camp unless personally invited. 2:02 p.m. PST Friday, Dec. 9: A group of veterans apologized to Native American elders for the decades of abuse perpetrated by American armed forces against indigenous people. The statement continued: The goal is to raise funds and gather supplies and deliver to the water protectors who are currently camped in the Standing Rock reservation, North Dakota. A few days after the show, 3 of the main-organizers, Talilo Marfil, Freddy Flowpez and Quincy Davis, will head out to Standing rock to deliver the supplies and the compilation CD, as part of the Standing Rock International Caravan led by Chief Buzz Nelson of the Lakota Pine Ridge and Northern Cheyenne.

We stay. New photo and video footage shows the harrowing conditions at the Standing Rock encampments. A blizzard in North Dakota is bringing a major arctic chill. PST Wednesday, Dec. 7: Two emails shed light on the inner workings of Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the Dakota Access pipeline. Journalist Shaun King shared the emails he'd received from separate sources, both regarding future developments of the pipeline. According to King, the text of the email included the following: Now is not the time to lay down and take the Army Corps of Engineers decision yesterday as a full victory. His company routinely finds any loophole it can and minimizes the social engagement necessary to get pipelines approved. They will NOT back down on this unless they are unequivocally forced to. They will fight with every tool they have and have a willing supporter in Trump. So not only is the fight for the pipeline not over, it likely just got HARDER, because attention and funds could fade. Everyone needs to be on their guard until literally every nut and bolt are removed from the site. Energy Transfer is a debt-riddled company with a lot riding on this easement. In late November, Sunoco Logistics and Energy Transfer Partners agreed a merger. The email states: I stumbled across some of the emails through our firm's file-sharing system and to sum up what I saw, ETP is counting on the future president's administration to have this pipeline happen. I nearly gagged in my office. To say the least, my desire to leave this firm has increased exponentially. I know that it's your job as a journalist to verify the facts, but I just need you to take my word on this. I'm not asking you to write about this, but to let any contacts you know who are at Standing Rock that the fight isn't over and that they really need to gear up once Trump is officially the president. I don't have any contacts over there and don't know anyone who does. If you don't believe me, I understand. You don't know me and have no reason to trust me. Just please, reaffirm anyone you know at Standing Rock that they need to be prepared to keep fighting. 10:37 a.m. They fear that Energy Transfer Partners will continue construction despite the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' decision to halt the project. Lawyers for Energy Transfer Partners asked U.S. District Judge James Boasberg for an expedited ruling late Monday that would allow the company to complete the project. A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday morning in Washington, D.C. As such news continues to spread, many water protectors are determined to spend the winter at camps around Standing Rock. And, as many of them note, the future of the pipeline under the Trump administration is unclear . A blizzard hit the area around Oceti Sakowin Camp Monday, and temperatures fell as low as -9 degrees Fahrenheit. Perhaps adding to their concern was news that a crude oil pipeline in Western North Dakota was shut down Tuesday after a leak spilled crude oil into a nearby creek. Reuters reports: The leak that prompted the shutdown was discovered in a six-inch pipeline operated by Belle Fourche Pipeline Company, the North Dakota Department of Health said. An undetermined amount of crude oil was spilled, the state said.

It needs replacement to cut down on the amount of digging and construction along its route. The Standing Rock Indian Reservation in south central North Dakota was the organizing grounds for what were often violent attacks on the construction of the Dakota Access line, though not one foot of that pipe was buried on reservation land. I can understand why a professional activist like LaDuke want to compare the opposition to Line 3 to the fight against Dakota Access pipeline. It drew national media attention and visits from celebrities, not to mention gobs and gobs of money in the form of donations to a rat's nest of groups and online accounts with little in the way of transparency or accountability. Today the Dakota Access Pipeline is bringing hundreds of thousands of barrels of North Dakota oil to market on a daily basis. None of the apocalyptic predictions made by overwrought activists during the pipeline's construction have come true. For months the public watched activists block highways and instigate violent conflicts with law enforcement. We watched them vandalize construction equipment, cutting wires and setting things on fire. We heard from citizens who lived in the region of the protests talk about harassment from the activists. When the protests ended we watched as tons and tons of garbage and human waste were removed, at the expense of the taxpayers, from the campsites where these supposed stewards of nature were living. Protests organized around the egos and careers of professional activists like LaDuke aren't likely to accomplish much.

Kayla DeVault posted Nov 22, 2016 A couple of weeks ago, as I stood before climate scientists, advocates, and world policy leaders at the COP22 in Morocco, I felt the increased importance of my message as climate denier Donald Trump was voted into office. I was there to bring Standing Rock to the world climate talks. Rarely do so many nations come together in one space for a shared purpose. Eventually they did. Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye announced a formal stance of solidarity and traveled to Cannon Ball, North Dakota, to plant the Navajo Nation flag there. Which brings me to the significance of counting by four. To understand Standing Rock, you must remove the Western lens and adopt a holistic, indigenous perspective of the world. BUMP bump bump bump. BUMP bump bump bump. The rhythm of the powwow drum, the heartbeat of life, beats in a sequence of fours. It celebrates the ebb and flow of the natural world. The rhythm falters only during the Honor Beats, when a Jingle Dress dancer raises her fan to catch the spirit of the drums. Rarely do so many nations come together in one space for a shared purpose. It is a gathering where commonalities are celebrated, such as the sacredness of the eagle feather and the direness of maintaining balance in the world. This similarly has been the exception of Standing Rock. And, just as the powwow rhythm carries four beats, an overwhelming number of indigenous communities count various elements of their lives in fours. The medicine wheel of Native culture represents the four directions. There are the four elements, which build all life and the four seasons that govern time. Where I live in the Navajo Nation, the culture is steeped in fours. Each Navajo has four clans that constitute his or her identity. Without this bigger picture, we lose sight of the interconnectedness of humans to nature and to each other. The intricacy of this worldview is captured in the traditional Navajo home, the hooghan or hogan. It represents the entirety of life as a Navajo: its four pillars symbolizing the four sacred mountains. Its doorway faces the east, a fire at the heart. Within the hogan, you are cradled between Mother Earth and Father Sky (visible through the smoke hole in the ceiling). This same smoke hole allows the sun to pass through. This direction is used in every ceremony and every meeting. The northern star, above the hogan, is the symbolic fire in the sky around which the First Man and First Woman constellations rotate. Everything in Navajo philosophy is related to the concept of balance, and even groups of fours balance one another. These could be your siblings, your clan relatives, your tribe, or even your belonging among all creations on this shared planet. We cannot address how climate change will affect our futures if we do not acknowledge the need for both balance and our fellow beings. The concepts may be of Navajo origin, but they embody the holistic viewpoint of many indigenous communities. To achieve sustainability in any society, we must ensure the protection of four areas of community well-being: Environmental: We are all made of water. We all breathe air. We cannot change our dependency on the four elements or the fact that they create us; therefore, we must protect our environment. Economic: No community can operate without an adequate and fair economy. Furthermore, the diversity and adaptability of an economy are key to its survival. Social: Our relationships to one another ensure the well-being of us as individuals and as societies. Our communities thrive when we have mutual respect, safety, and room for personal growth. Cultural: Identity is a critical part of community sustainability, and it is often left out of the greater picture. This is a crucial issue when indigenous communities attempt to assert their sovereign authority and are faced with infringement of their cultural freedoms and rights which, without, would destroy the ability to maintain harmony. So this is what I had to say to the climate justice world two weeks ago. Standing Rock requires us not to forget that fourth piece: cultural identity. Standing Rock requires us not to forget that fourth piece: cultural identity. When we have global conversations about loss and damage, we cannot simply tick off the population counts for displaced people or the dollar figures for economic impact or infrastructure damage. This is watching disorder through a Western lens. Instead, we must analyze the loss and damage done to a way of life, to the sustainability of an entire identity of people. The United Nations may have a definition for poverty, but to be impoverished does not always equate to having no financial leverage. Hardships come in many forms. Their lives were extraordinarily difficult, but the definition of what they consider true hardships provides important context. Not surprisingly, the traditional Lakota people define four hardships in life: To hear an orphan cry, as it was a terrible sound. To lose a child, an indescribable pain. To lose your mother. To not know where your warriors fell. And perhaps that is why, on Sept. 3, the water protectors who watched Dakota Access workers destroy the graves of their ancestors, continued to pray for and forgive the ignorance of those committing the crimes against them. Our cultural lenses prevent many of us from realizing that. As I told the COP22 audiences, the battle at Standing Rock symbolizes the greater battle we all face: The assurance of cultural well-being and sustainability as a global community while combating the short-term visions and greed of corporations.

News of the charges adds to growing concerns that law enforcement is aggressively monitoring, arresting and prosecuting people affiliated with the anti-pipeline movement. The Guardian recently reported that an FBI terrorism task force has attempted to contact at least three people tied to the demonstrations. Matthew Crane, one of five founding members of VeteransRespond, was pulled over last Friday night when he was arriving to Standing Rock with two other vets and a fourth passenger. The group got lost on a closed road, he said, and they were trying to find officers to get directions.

He lives in New York, where medical cannabis is also legal. On Thursday, police in Mobridge, South Dakota, arrested two individuals that officials claimed were VeteransRespond members. Sanderson, however, said they were not members, although one of them, Travis Biolette, is now loosely affiliated with the group, which is assisting him in his charges.

Photograph: Courtesy of Travis Biolette A police search found hash oil, which is classified as a controlled substance in South Dakota. Biolette and his friend were taken to jail in Selby, South Dakota. In a phone interview Monday night, Biolette said he spent four nights in jail and was released earlier in the day. He said that police pulled him over for speeding about six miles above the limit and that when he revealed he was going to Standing Rock, the officer launched a search. He said the hash oil is his prescribed medication, which he uses for PTSD and major depressive disorder. Biolette, who is now getting support from VeteransRespond members who picked him up from jail, said police still have his vehicle with all of his possessions, including his cold-weather clothing. Nonetheless, he was still planning on Monday night to go to Standing Rock, which he also visited last year. VeteransRespond has said it intends to help Standing Rock leaders on camp with a range of responsibilities, including cleanup efforts, kitchen help and medical aid.

David Swallow, an Oglala Native American, holds an eagle fan as he speaks during an interfaith ceremony at the Oceti Sakowin camp where people have gathered to protest the Dakota Access oil pipeline in Cannon Ball, N.D., Sunday, Dec. 4, 2016. All rights reserved. After eight months, starting with a few hundred young Native Americans and swelling to up to 15,000 people in the sprawling encampments of Standing Rock, North Dakota, a victory was celebrated. The Army Corps of Engineers further required a full Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), which usually takes months and sometimes years, to reconsider granting the easement. The sunny and wind-swept prairie of Standing Rock reveals the absurdity of building fossil fuel infrastructure that will further harm the planet when renewable energy is everywhere, waiting to be developed. The vets formed a human shield protecting the water protectors from the myriad local law enforcement officers who work on behalf of the interests of the private oil and gas industries. Several of the vets said that, after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, their effort to protect Standing Rock was the first time they actually felt they were protecting the American people. Several of the vets said that, after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, their effort to protect Standing Rock was the first time they actually felt they were protecting the American people. After almost 500 years of white settlers and the US government stealing land from Native American tribes and forging divisions between them, over 200 Native tribes have coalesced to protect Standing Rock. The history of government-sanctioned genocide and colonialism are recurring themes in this struggle. Thousands of indigenous peoples from all over the world and tens of thousands of non-indigenous peoples have come to Standing Rock to defend indigenous rights and to protect Mother Earth. There lie the seeds of unity and dissent. They see fossil fuel infrastructure as dangerous to the future of humans on earth. They want to see the development of renewable energy and the end of fossil fuels. Dave Archambault, II, Chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and primary spokesperson for the coalition of tribes, will be satisfied if the pipeline is re-routed away from the Sioux orbit. He has told the water protectors camping on the grounds, to go home to their families for the winter: their jobs are done. Many Native Americans, many desperately poor and denied opportunities, have sold mineral rights to their parcels of land to fossil fuel developers. This is a basic contradiction within indigenous peoples: those who see Mother Earth as their responsibility to protect for the next seven generations (an indigenous mantra), versus those who want to address their own poverty which seems much more immediate. This is a global phenomenon. Those who see Mother Earth as their responsibility versus those who want to address their own poverty which seems much more immediate. This is a global phenomenon. Months of battles with brutal local law enforcement have left hundreds of water protectors facing arrests, rubber bullets, tear gas, concussion grenades, water cannons used in sub-freezing temperatures, serious injuries and brutal treatment when incarcerated. Images of this police brutality against indigenous peoples and their supporters have galvanized support for the protests and brought thousands of people to the 5-6 camps that make up the sprawling Standing Rock encampment. All rights reserved. Red Warriors see these direct action confrontations as the reason that Standing Rock has gotten any publicity at all and has attracted the attention and won the hearts of radicals and human rights advocates across the world. Life at Standing Rock: building liberated spaces Standing Rock has developed massive camps, replete with many cooking tents each serving hundreds at every meal; a large-scale donation operation; legal, medical and psychological counseling services; schools, orientation sessions and direct action trainings. Each morning and evening people gather around sacred fires and hear information, speeches, music and dance and feel the power of unity. Comparisons with Occupy Wall Street and its spin-offs reveal a much larger, more on-going and much more disciplined space in Standing Rock. It has captured the imagination and support of hundreds of thousands of people across the planet, from the indigenous Sami peoples of Norway to workers from all over the US who are angry at the lack of support from organized labor, specifically the AFL-CIO. The presence of youth is immediately noticeable at the camps though there are plenty of elders and children as well. Supporters mostly camp out and help to winterize the teepee, yurts, army tents, recreational vehicles, camping tents, vans and school buses that create a small city of protest. They are creating a liberated space, a space where progressive people can come together to protect their ideas and their cultures together. The utopian feel of the place is immediately apparent. The pull of such a liberated space is all the more meaningful in the face of US President-elect, Donald Trump. The encampment is simultaneously an historic throwback and a futuristic village of care and commitment to a more egalitarian and caring world. The pull of such a liberated space is all the more meaningful in the face of US President-elect, Donald Trump. The history of indigenous tribes welcoming people of African descent, especially during slavery, is not forgotten in this solidarity. Standing Rock is orderly and behavioral norms are clearly articulated and encouraged, if not enforced. Naomi Klein, in her groundbreaking book, This Changes Everything, asserts that the climate movement can only be successful if it addresses racial, gender and economic oppression as its main strategy and if it takes leadership from those most affected by climate change and the savages of capitalism. Without so much explicit language this is evidently what is happening at Standing Rock. The power of this strategy impacts everyone who enters the camp and the movement; the pull of this approach is enormous. On December 4 and 5, over 15,000 people celebrated the Army Corps of Engineers decision to deny the permit to complete DAPL as planned, but the struggle is nowhere over. Several factors make for a complex web of possibilities that underscore the necessity of the encampment and wide support to continue. Holly Doll, of Mandan, an enrolled member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, holds a protest sign outside the state capitol building, in Bismarck, N.D., Saturday, Oct. 29, 2016. All rights reserved. That will be challenged in court as the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that federal agencies cannot change a settled ruling of a federal agency that is based on facts when a new administration takes over. The US Supreme Court declined to take up this ruling, leaving the Ninth Circuit decision to prevail. If Trump tried to get the permit without an environmental impact statement he would have an immediate lawsuit on his hands that would prevent the easement from taking effect, at least immediately. Other lawsuits against ETP are already in the courts and proceeding, further slowing down the process. Further, Trump has talked about privatizing over 56 million acres of Native American reservations in order to facilitate exploitation of the natural resources of those lands. That fight will ignite much more organizing and fight back. Second, and perhaps most important, are the specifics of the contracts between ETP and Sunoco Logistics, their partner organization in this project, and the dozens of major financial institutions that have invested in DAPL. At that point the financial institutions will have the legal right to back out of or diminish their investments. There are dozens, perhaps hundreds, of groups in the US that are pressuring these very financial institutions to drop their investments in DAPL. Many of the pension funds of public workers and others are invested in these financial institutions and supporters are mounting campaigns to uncover them and demand divestment. Supporters have been cutting up their credit cards and closing their accounts from banks investing in DAPL. Supporters have been cutting up their credit cards and closing their accounts from banks investing in DAPL. They found a sharp decline in oil production that may signal no further need for the pipeline. For some of the investors, DAPL is looking risky on many levels. Third, ETP has a way to sneak out of the job as well. The demonstrators have been peaceful if sometimes provocative and a great deal of video evidence indicates that the violence has emanated from the law enforcement officers, not the protesters. A great deal of video evidence indicates that the violence has emanated from the law enforcement officers, not the protesters. Fourth, the popular support for Standing Rock seems to grow with each day and each report of violence against the water protectors. There are similar challenges of fossil fuel pipelines in many parts of the US and they are gathering people to protest in those places as well. The model of encampments, of creating liberated spaces that protect the activists, land, water and movement, has taken hold. No force will hold that back. From the AIM Spectra Pipeline, slated to go under the Hudson River and immediately past the Indian Point Nuclear Power Station 10 miles from New York City, to the Black Mesa Water Coalition of the US southwest, the struggles to reject fossil fuel infrastructure and to build a sustainable energy economy is everywhere in the US as it is across the planet. A new solidarity is emerging. One that has a great deal of potential to unite the left under the joint banners of the oppression of people, particularly people of color, and the oppression of the earth itself. The hope lies in navigating that unity with a vision of solving both oppressions simultaneously. A new world is conceived. Its home is everywhere, its people are many. While its opponents are on the ascent, the struggle continues. Compassion, respect, clear demands and decision-making and solidarity can guide the way.

Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome. It is like using money to fight money. We better learn how to do this; we will need this tactic in the days ahead when we fight global warming.

Sarain Carson-Fox an Anishinaabe artist, activist and the host of the RISE series. Transcript This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form. The War and Peace Report. Sarain Fox is with us. She is an Anishinaabe artist, activist and host of this film series called RISE on Viceland. In fact, she was a star on Paradise Falls, which was a soap opera years ago. And, Michelle, I was really interested in this. But I want to go back in time to you being a soap star. MICHELLE LATIMER: No, I was actually playing a bisexual goth. I wanted to be seen as an actress and not be pigeonholed as only being invited to play Native roles. And it was hard, because I wanted to identify, but I was also advised maybe not to. I got pigeonholed to play Native roles. I played the love interest of Adam Beach in a TV series in Canada called Moose TV. MICHELLE LATIMER: No, actually, I did. I was on another show called Blackstone, and I also considered that show very positive and whole, absolutely. AMY GOODMAN: And talk about that shift and what this means, how the two of you, with Viceland, conceived of this series. And there was high rates of suicide because of that, and depression and substance abuse. And it made me want to tell the stories from my own community. Vice actually called me. And it was like a dream come true. AMY GOODMAN: So talk about this. But you go so deeply into it, back centuries, looking forward and talking to the people involved. And resistance meaning that it can take many forms, you know, but, obviously, the most obvious one being occupation and literally putting our bodies on the line to stop these infrastructure, fossil fuel industries, mining, that kind of thing. And so it gave us that ability to go deeper. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: The first piece being Oak Flat. Yeah, so that was our very first episode that we went out on, and it was very interesting because the Oak Flat movement actually became a lead-in for many other issues. But what we saw there was a land grab. Give us the context of what happened with Oak Flat in Arizona. So there was only an hour for everyone to read the entire bill, and it was slipped in. And that rider essentially gave away the land to Rio Tinto, a mining company. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: So, basically, it has to do with copper. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: Well, the Apaches are basically left to deal with the aftermath. They were not told that this was happening. And when they were notified, it was far too late to have any ability to do anything. So, the Apache people were an afterthought for this decision. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: Well, Senator McCain has a very complicated history with the indigenous people, especially in Arizona, because he was appointed to represent indigenous people and to be a part of negotiating their voice within the state. AMY GOODMAN: So describe the resistance that you document in RISE. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: Yeah, so, with the Apache Stronghold, we see a really grassroots movement of indigenous warriors who are coming together to occupy. So, that occupation is a really simple but powerful tool. So, simply by occupying land and putting their bodies on the line, they are reminding everyone that this is the land that is sacred to them. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: Roy Chavez, former mayor of the neighboring town of Superior, is one of the many non-indigenous supporters of Oak Flat. He opposes the mining methods Resolution is proposing, and has offered to show me what will happen to Oak Flat if the mine goes through. ROY CHAVEZ: Good. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: Good, good. My family worked in the mines and such. Serving as mayor, I actually got involved politically here when the mine first shut down, the Magma Copper mine, in 1982. Magma Copper laid off between 1,200 and 1,400 employees here at the Superior mine in one day. So, I have something to show you in reference to the project. This is the subsidence area. ROY CHAVEZ: Subsidence is the cave-in of the surface, two-and-a-half miles wide, a thousand feet deep. The Eiffel Tower would fit at the bottom of this, and you could see the tip of it from the outside areas here. The rest is waste. One percent is the profit. The rest of this has to be placed somewhere. We used to put this back underground. One-point-six billion tons of toxic mine waste will be produced. ROY CHAVEZ: Yes. ROY CHAVEZ: Sure. But I agree with you. The fight has just started. No one wants to lose Oak Flat. Senator Flake also has an interesting history when it comes to mining in Arizona. MICHELLE LATIMER: And water, yeah, absolutely. And it was interesting, because at that time when we were filming, Bernie Sanders stepped in to introduce a sister bill into the Senate. So we had bills in the Congress and bills in the Senate that were trying to stop what was happening to Oak Flat. MICHELLE LATIMER: Yeah. Sorry, I should have mentioned that. Yeah, he was a lobbyist for Rio Tinto before he became the senator. MICHELLE LATIMER: Yeah, Rio Tinto is one of the greatest human rights abusers in the world for resource companies. You know, I was in a small airport in Northern BC, and I saw an office for Rio Tinto. MICHELLE LATIMER: Yeah, absolutely. There are so many men coming in to mine and to live in these man camps that, you know, I think it helps them to facilitate these people coming through the airport. AMY GOODMAN: Now, talk about the overall resistance, from this area of Arizona, from Oak Flat, to the standoff at Standing Rock, which you have two of your documentaries about. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: So, one of the most amazing things, as we traveled the world last year and met with these front-line communities, is that you often saw that every single front-line community was connected. So, Oak Flat resisters were also in Mauna Kea, so when we went to Mauna Kea, we had met with people who were connecting in that way. So, we really saw a collective response at Standing Rock. And so, you saw all of the front-line warriors come together, protectors come together at Standing Rock. The people of North Dakota in other places, like in Mandan, in the capital, Bismarck, have said no to it. And he has, Michelle. I mean, at the time we were filming, Donald Trump was the keynote speaker at an oil and gas conference in the state capital of Bismarck, North Dakota. Yeah, yeah. He was invested in the pipeline, up until a certain point. Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas, as soon as he stepped down, within two weeks, he was on the board of Energy Transfer Partners. MICHELLE LATIMER: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: There are a lot of close ties right now. MICHELLE LATIMER: I think, for me, that was the biggest sort of eye-opening thing about making this series, was the absolute pervasive levels of corruption that we witnessed everywhere, from Brazil to Canada to America, and then also seeing how the state is enforcing this kind of behavior by having militarized police, by having the National Guard there. For years, it was considered the least valuable land, but as more and more resources were found under it, it may well be the most valuable land. Colonization is based on privatization. They work as collectives. As soon as you privatize, you can fracture community. And then that causes a fracturing in community. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: Yeah. And so, for me, the fight for water has been very, very close to home. And for indigenous people, water is our most sacred being. When we give birth, when we carry life, we carry life in water. So, for me, traveling all over the world, that came up in every single community. Water is at the center of all of these fights. And indigenous people have never had the thought to own land or to own water. It is our job to protect those things. So, for me, it has just reminded me of how important it is to continue to do this work and to continue to make choices that are uncomfortable and inconvenient, to make way for water and for our land to be protected. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: The Navajo have always been renowned for their fighting spirit. As Navajo men, both Chris and Bronson have connected to their ancestry through modern ways of combat. REGGIE MITCHELL: I love driving through Navajo land. Reggie is bringing Bronson to the canyon, not only to train, but to perform a cleansing ceremony that will rid him of any negative thoughts. These kinds of rituals are ones that warriors have been undertaking for centuries to prepare for battle. REGGIE MITCHELL: It is important for us to be able to do these things so that we maintain and hold on to our traditions. We have to have the discipline. Some webs shining around. REGGIE MITCHELL: Oh, yeah. Only left with goodness, beauty and power. REGGIE MITCHELL: All right, son. And, you know, Michelle, this is Michelle. So we saw people arriving just to tell this story as a news story. AMY GOODMAN: Sarain Fox, you did a documentary on youth suicide, indigenous youth suicide, called Cut-Off. It was last spring that we went in. It was also about water. And I thought it was very interesting that those two became connected. But we asked Justin Trudeau if he would join us in a First Nations community. And so, we flew him in to a remote community, and he did join us for an entire day on Shoal Lake 40, and we allowed the opportunity for the community to talk directly to him. So we delivered water door to door. He got to see the way that the infrastructure is affected there. So, in Shoal Lake 40, they have been physically removed from the rest of Canada. And so, their land base was cut off from the mainland so that an aquifer could go in to deliver water to Winnipeg. And by doing so, they lost all the ability to connect to regular infrastructure, and the Canadian government did not take care of that. Everything was going good this morning. But then, before lunchtime, things started occurring on Facebook, social media. People were posting their problems about suicidal thoughts, of trying to attempt to kill themselves, I guess. And it was pretty hectic before you guys showed up. And I was pretty much involved looking for some of them. And everybody took action trying to look for these kids that were doing that on Facebook. Everybody was overwhelmed by it, sad. And I was, too, and very worried. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: The suicide epidemic on reserves might be something that people are talking about right now, but suicide has been an issue within First Nations communities for a long time. In Manitoba, 62 percent of First Nations children live below the poverty line. And then you have some communities that just keep getting put in the hole. They just keep getting put in isolation. AMY GOODMAN: That was a clip from the documentary Cut-Off. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: So, we looked at youth suicide in Cross Lake, which is also a remote community. We can talk about all the political backstories. AMY GOODMAN: And explain what you mean by residential school. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: Residential schools were schools that the government used to forcibly remove children from their homes and to assimilate them into what they called society. But what it did was it removed all of their culture. Children were taken from their homes. They were put in boarding schools. Their hair was cut. They were forbidden to speak their language. And they were abused, and there was rampant sexual abuse. And many children also died at the hands of nuns and priests in these schools. All my aunties, my grandmother went to residential school. So, for us, there is no disconnect between the youth suicide and who we are. It is not something that we talk about that is separate from us. Suicide rates in indigenous communities are some of the highest in the country, if not the world. And we are all deeply affected by it. So, for me, suicide is so close to home that I can almost see it as the blanket of grief that has to be removed before we can rise up as indigenous people. AMY GOODMAN: And, Michelle Latimer, you did a separate film about youth suicide. MICHELLE LATIMER: Yeah. AMY GOODMAN: An animated film. MICHELLE LATIMER: An animated film. And that film was animated because I was actually going to make a documentary about youth at an indigenous school in my community. They live billeted often with white families, separated from their own community, their own family. And they go to this school. And I noticed that the art class there was doing really innovative, politically charged work, and I wanted to show those kids. So I made it into an animated film that looked at that. And they want to know why. So I had an amazing support team. He turned to drugs and alcohol, like many indigenous people do, to deal with his pain. And so, I had to completely relearn who I was from that side. And as soon as you see someone like that, you remove all of the anger, and you remove all of the judgment. And so, for me, doing this work is a direct way for me to recover, continuously recover, and change the narrative as an indigenous person. AMY GOODMAN: I wanted to ask you, finally, about Leonard Peltier and what he represents. MICHELLE LATIMER: There was a lot of hope that he would be granted clemency. But we are resilient, and we will continue moving forward. But Leonard Peltier represents basically hope and a will to move forward, because he continues to speak out. He continues to give messages of hope to the front-line protesters, protectors. SARAIN CARSON-FOX: I just want to add that I think indigenous people have always been given just enough from the federal government to feel that they had a place to stand. And the real truth is that the American people are terrified of an indigenous uprising. AMY GOODMAN: Well, I want to thank you both for being with us. Sarain Fox, Anishinaabe activist, artist, dancer, journalist, the host of this eight-part documentary series for Viceland called RISE.

Officers in North Dakota and South Dakota have pulled over and searched at least four veterans on their way to the camps at Standing Rock in recent days, charging two of them for medical cannabis. Army veterans return to Standing Rock to form a human shield against police Read more The charges against two veterans, who said they use medical cannabis to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, come days after a veterans service organization announced it would be returning to Standing Rock to provide support. News of the charges adds to growing concerns that law enforcement is aggressively monitoring, arresting and prosecuting people affiliated with the anti-pipeline movement. The Guardian recently reported that an FBI terrorism task force has attempted to contact at least three people tied to the demonstrations. Matthew Crane, one of five founding members of VeteransRespond, was pulled over last Friday night when he was arriving to Standing Rock with two other vets and a fourth passenger. The group got lost on a closed road, he said, and they were trying to find officers to get directions. Revealed: FBI terrorism taskforce investigating Standing Rock activists Read more The 33-year-old navy veteran said he has a disability stemming from his service and that the roughly one gram of medical marijuana he had on him came from Washington DC, where cannabis is legal. He lives in New York, where medical cannabis is also legal. On Thursday, police in Mobridge, South Dakota, arrested two individuals that officials claimed were VeteransRespond members. Sanderson, however, said they were not members, although one of them, Travis Biolette, is now loosely affiliated with the group, which is assisting him in his charges. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Travis Biolette, who uses hash oil for his PTSD, is facing a felony and up to five years in state prison. Photograph: Courtesy of Travis Biolette A police search found hash oil, which is classified as a controlled substance in South Dakota. Biolette and his friend were taken to jail in Selby, South Dakota. In a phone interview Monday night, Biolette said he spent four nights in jail and was released earlier in the day. He said that police pulled him over for speeding about six miles above the limit and that when he revealed he was going to Standing Rock, the officer launched a search. He said the hash oil is his prescribed medication, which he uses for PTSD and major depressive disorder. Biolette, who is now getting support from VeteransRespond members who picked him up from jail, said police still have his vehicle with all of his possessions, including his cold-weather clothing. Nonetheless, he was still planning on Monday night to go to Standing Rock, which he also visited last year. VeteransRespond has said it intends to help Standing Rock leaders on camp with a range of responsibilities, including cleanup efforts, kitchen help and medical aid.
