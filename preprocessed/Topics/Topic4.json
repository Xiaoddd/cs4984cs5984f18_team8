Water protectors: Over 8,000 protesters have gathered at Standing Rock. Hundreds have been injured, hundreds have been arrested (Amy Goodman of Democracy Now among them). Environmental racism: The pipeline was to cross the Missouri River just north of White-majority Bismarck. Bismarck raised concerns that the pipeline would poison their water supply. But the courts approved it anyway. Thus the protests. (Standing Rock was the reservation of Sitting Bull and Vine Deloria, Jr) The pipeline crosses four states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. Just the bit near Standing Rock is left. That bit is to cross land and water claimed by both Standing Rock and the US Army. On December 4th 2016, on the eve of what promised to be an ugly showdown between protesters and state police, the US Army Corps of Engineers said it would not approve the pipeline crossing, that the matter needed further study to determine the safest river crossing. That could take months to years. Enter Donald Trump: Trump, soon to become the US president, has come out in favour of the pipeline. In 2015 he had money in ETP and in Phillips 66, which owns a fourth of the pipeline. Kelcy Warren, the head of ETP, gave Trump money to run for president. This win appears to be for the individuals who are protesting. What will the Donald do with this project. Most comments I have read are against this project based on fear and a play on Corporate greed against the little man.

In this case it is a private Oil company not a public service company that is claiming eminate domain over private properties in the area. In this pay for play senerio the government is granting eminate domain privilages to a private company that wants to ship oil to Mexico. Additionally, when Native American women became pregnant, white settlers violently hurled them against the rocks. This was just another demonic method of population control. (smh) Unsurprisingly, the Bible says a certain group of people never was apportioned any land to begin with and therefore, would be somewhat of a homeless wanderer. Fast forward to December 2016. And now, approximately 400 years after a certain group of people took this land through force and chicanery, are at it again. This time, with militarized police units, Pepper spray, Pit Bulls, German Shepherds and tear gas canisters and the framing of cartoonish laws to commit further theft of land in order to build an oil pipeline for economic purposes and benefit a few greedy, cigar smoking, tobacco chewing white settlers. They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood. The land was removed from the Reservation in 1944 by law. The public has no say, I have no say and you have no say. The current President must believe he wants to stop it and the new President says he wants it. Before they arrived in the Americas they have slaughters millions and millions of people and they have continued through out history up until the mass slaughter taking place in the Middle East currently. Idealism is what caused the election of the current President Elect. There is a federal law, the National Historic Preservation Act, which makes it illegal to knowingly destroy a tribal sacred site. The federal government and the corporations know there are tribal sacred sites on the land in question. This is a violation of federal law. You only know what you are reading and what you choose to believe. If this were your business you would want people to stay out of it, yet you express your thoughts as though you are the wises of the sages. Let the courts handle this matter. My suggestion is let he courts handle the matter, as I stated in my last comment. Unless you have studied a lot of law yourself you are repeating what some one said. If the law was as clear as you think it is there would be no dispute. Do not bother to respond with another negative comment as I will be out of here. I did not see a single insult or negative comment. Actually, all quite positive. Only this one seemed a bit sarcastic: Pie in the Sky and the Big Rock Candy Mountain And I would love to see some posts on that. Allen, I understand your level of frustration. There was a Bismark route that was considered initially but it presented more risks than the current route in terms of crossing multiple tributaries and wetlands, crossing multiple roads, passing nearby to many residences, etc. As currently routed, the DAPL will cross the Missouri River twice. The first crossing is upstream from Bismark. There is no protest taking place with respect to that crossing. It would have been possible to route it westward, around the Missouri, avoiding any crossing at all, but that would have added many miles to the pipeline and increased its cost by a large number. It would also have routed the line through an area of many lakes, tributaries and wetlands, increasing by many times the risk of polluting the ecosystem. The controversial stretch of the DAPL follows an existing natural gas pipeline that already runs through the same area and was built decades ago. It is not uncommon to route pipelines through the same corridor because the right of way is already owned. Moving oil by pipeline is way safer from an ecological perspective than other alternatives, mainly moving it overland by truck or rail. The volume of spills and number of accidents via overland transportation is a lot higher than via pipeline. The regulatory framework and process that gives rise to this dispute is complicated, on purpose. The concept of regulatory capture is at play here. Regulatory capture is where a regulated industry learns to manipulate the regulatory process for its own benefit. The oil bizz is a master of this. The planning for this pipeline has been going on for years, but the protests are cropping up only now, after all of the dirty backroom stuff has been done. The oil industry is famous for routing oil lines through waterways that put populations at risk. A rupture of that line, which is a real risk, would affect the largest clean freshwater supply in the world, a source of drinking water for millions of people ranging from Chicago to Milwaukee to Detroit. Anybody commenting on this issue on a computer, using the internet, is complicit in this process. The oil biz is rich and powerful because humans consume lots of oil. We are greedy and we want to keep on buying huge quantities of the stuff, so they work hard to comply, laughing all the way to the bank. A big user is electrical generating. A big user of electricity is the internet and other electronic devices. In the last few decades the per capita use of electricity in the developed western world has increased, mainly due to computers and the internet. The oil being harvested in North Dakota is fueling that thirst. Ironically, due to the influx of oil and other fuels from other areas, the North Dakota oil bizz has seen a significant downturn in the last year or so. Former boomtowns are turning into ghost towns. Once the pipeline is completed, the volume of oil it will transport will be a trickle compared to the volume that was in play when this pipeline was in the planning stages. In the meantime, that oil has been transported overland, resulting in multiple accidents and spills along the way, most of which would not have occurred had the pipeline been in place all along. LikeLike on Wednesday December 7th 2016 at 16:31:44 Mary Burrell Access to clean water is a basic human right. So the Native Americans and the poor people in Flint Michigan are suffering because of the evil establishment. I also feel that their sacred ground should be respected and not disturbed. The oil biz is rich and powerful because humans consume lots of oil. Yes, humans consume lots of oil. There are safer, renewable alternatives such as solar, wind, geothermal, biomass and wave that have been systematically sidelined by those very same oil companies and their political servants. There is also the issue of taxpayer subsidies for the fossil fuel extractors. Those subsidies advantage oil and gas, etc. and disadvantage renewables. Finally there is the issue of endless wars that siphon tax dollars away from socially useful needs like education, healthcare and housing. Some of those war funds land in the pockets of the fossil fuel extractors. So the fossil fuel providers get a payday not only from consumers, but also through subsidies and war contracts. In fact, fossil energy is solar energy. It was created by the sun, shining on vegetation that died and decayed, or was eaten by animals that died and decayed, over millions of years. It is the cumulative solar energy from millions of years of sunshine, stored in fossil form. This is why such small amounts of the stuff can now release such giant amounts of energy. Oil companies are among the most profitable corporations on the planet. They did not need subsidies in the past and they certainly do not need them now. Subsidies represent another way fossil fuel extractors divert funds from the national treasury to their own pockets. The subsidies exist because of their ability to purchase politicians. Renewable sources of energy such as sun, wind and geothermal are perfectly capable of meeting global energy demands. Recent energy storage technology in the form of batteries are making one hundred percent energy conversion to renewables feasible. Utilities need to deliver reliable and steady energy by balancing supply and demand. While today they can usually handle the fluctuations that solar and wind power present to the grid by adjusting their operations, as the amount of energy supplied by renewables grows, better battery storage is crucial. Batteries convert electricity into chemical potential energy for storage and back into electrical energy as needed. They can perform different functions at various points along the electric grid. At the site of solar PV or wind turbines, batteries can smooth out the variability of flow and store excess energy when demand is low to release it when demand is high. Currently, fluctuations are handled by drawing power from natural gas, nuclear or coal-fired power plants; but whereas fossil-fuel plants can take many hours to ramp up, batteries respond quickly and when used to replace fossil-fuel power plants, they cut CO2 emissions. For households, batteries can store energy for use anytime and provide back-up power in case of blackouts. Batteries have not been fully integrated into the mainstream power system because of performance and safety issues, regulatory barriers, the resistance of utilities and cost. It was created by the sun, shining on vegetation that died and decayed, or was eaten by animals that died and decayed, over millions of years. The fossil energy is solar energy argument is specious. In other words, it sounds reasonable, but is false. Fossil energy comes from stored carbon. Human extraction and burning of that stored carbon has caused an imbalance, an excess of carbon, methane and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, oceans and polar ice caps. That excess is driving climate change and threatening the lives and livelihoods of millions of people. Burning fossil fuels is not a sustainable energy solution for humans or the planet.

Everything I read indicated all new work environments are using modern methods such as windmills, solar or nuclear. It will be a very long time before the use of oil is not needed because of the lifespan of of the current means of production. When it is no longer profitable for oil it will be abandoned. The technology is dangerous and storing the toxic waste products is a major hazard. Fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal could have been abandoned long ago. They are still around because the suppliers have great sway over their paid political servants. Both moves were expected.

The project has been stalled for years, as President Obama has been reluctant to approve it partially due to environmental concerns. Even the U.S. State Department said that, while there would not be a major impact on climate change, the pipeline would likely experience spills in the course of its lifetime. The risk of an oil spill from Keystone XL is particularly concerning to environmentalists because of the type of oil involved. Tar sands oil is more difficult to clean up than conventional crude because, when it spills into water, it does not float. Instead, it gradually sinks, making normal cleanup techniques and equipment of little use. This is partially what made the 2010 Enbridge oil spill so difficult to clean up. Environmentalists also decry tar sands oil extraction because of its carbon intensity. The extraction process causes more greenhouse gas emissions than other types of oil. This is likely not an issue for Donald Trump, however, as he does not think greenhouses gases cause climate change.

The 1,100-mile pipeline, the subject of controversy and mass protests, will be fully operational June 1, according to Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the company that built it. But in April, a mechanical failure caused an 84-gallon oil spill northeast of Tulare, a tiny town in South Dakota. The spill was entirely contained and is considered small. Watch the VICELAND documentary on Standing Rock: The spill happened April 4 during the testing of a surge pump, according to Brian Walsh, an environmental scientist with the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources. At this particular pump station, oil is pumped into what's called a surge tank, which measures flow rates, among other things, and then pumped back into the main line. The surge pump had a mechanical failure, but the entire spill happened within a lined containment area. Gravel on top of the liner that covered with oil was collected and disposed of, and oil never touched the unlined ground. Walsh told me that South Dakota typically gets 200 to 300 spills a year from fuel leaks, pipelines, oil wells, and various other sources.

The South Dakota government tracks spills of all kinds on a map on a website, searchable by date, type of spill, and responsible party. But there are no announcements of any particular spill; a reporter for the Aberdeen American News, a local outlet, broke the story of the DAPL after finding it on the site. The state's full report on the spill isn't complete yet. Walsh said it will take a couple of weeks, once ETP submits documentation to show that it disposed of contaminated materials properly. Meanwhile, the tribe's legal battle against ETP continues. They has asked a judge to declare that the Trump administration's reversal of the environmental study and issuing the permits was illegal. That decision could take weeks or months. In the meantime, new reports have emerged revealing that the company doesn't yet have emergency equipment in place to handle a major spill in the future. As for the April spill, Hasselman pointed out that it would have received more attention if it were a major spill that affected drinking water.

Yes that is what I said, mycelium can eat oil and therefore help clean up an oil spill. A variety of Oyster mushrooms have proven to be extremely efficient at consuming oil and turning it into a non-toxic compost in less than 3 months. Here is a video describing the process that was successfully used in 2007 during the oil spill in San Fransisco. Clearly this is a viable solution and we should be jumping at the chance to use it with the most recent spill. I would hope that all the top scientists and companies related to this disaster would be investigating this concept to the fullest extent. Sadly we are not hearing any recent news or anything updated on this topic. Hair naturally absorbs oil from air and water and acts as the perfect sponge for an oil slick. Once the mats are soaked with oil you can inject oyster mushroom mycelium or simply place it on the mats to absorb and grow off the oil. The mushrooms will take approximately 12 weeks to absorb all of the oil, converting the oily hair mats into nontoxic compost. This past event has inspired Spores101 to try and get involved and we are currently investigating ways we can help by using this technology given to us by nature.

The reality, however, is far from that portrayal, and those fighting the Keystone XL tar sands pipelines are making that point glaringly clear. Landowners and tribal members are joining together to build solar projects directly in the path of the proposed pipeline. While TransCanada wants to build projects that would harm the land, pose ongoing dangers to the water supplies of millions of Americans, and devastate tribal lands, these stewards are building the solutions they want to see Nebraska and the country embrace. On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to see these projects first hand. Greenpeace Canada Solar- and wind-powered barn In 2013, landowners, tribal members and volunteers came together to build a solar- and wind-powered barn on land directly inside the proposed TransCanada Keystone XL pipeline route. It is already producing energy, and for TransCanada to build its dirty oil pipeline, it would have to tear down clean energy to do it. Greenpeace Canada Solar XL While TransCanada continues to push its destructive project, landowners are back at it again, planning to build more solar projects, right in Keystone's path, throughout the state. The first of the latest round of solar installations is already up, and just yesterday landowner and farmer Jim Carlson received approval to plug the clean energy it will produce directly into the Nebraska power grid. Greenpeace Canada These groups are leading their opposition with solutions. Showing the world the type of energy we know we need to be producing and focusing on. We need energy sources that help protect the land, the water, and create far more jobs than a dirty tar sands pipeline ever will.

A common practice, unknown by the average consumer. Millions of current and former workers at hundreds of large companies are thus worth a great deal to their employers dead, as well as alive, yielding billions of dollars in tax breaks over the years, as well as a steady stream of tax-free death benefits. Nestle USA has policies covering 18,000 workers, Pitney Bowes Inc. has policies covering 23,000, and Procter & Gamble Co. has 15,000 covered workers, spokespeople for these companies confirm. The coverage is called broad-based insurance, or corporate-owned life insurance, usually shortened to COLI. For years, companies could insure only key personnel deemed essential to the business. However, executive compensation was only one use for such insurance policies that was cited by the companies interviewed about COLI payouts; insurance funds were applied in a number of ways to company expenses of varying descriptions. Winn-Dixie purchased EOLI policies on approximately 36,000 employees and systematically borrowed against the cash value of the policies to fund the premiums. The income tax savings to Winn-Dixie from deducting the interest payments and related fees were projected to be substantially in excess of potential benefit to Winn-Dixie from maintaining the EOLI program. Winn-Dixie was not alone in maintaining EOLI policies on a broad base of employees. While Congress and the I.R.S. continued to challenge the deductibility of interest and fees incurred in connection with EOLI policies, the public was becoming increasingly concerned with the ghoulish nature of employers profiting from the death of their employees. On October 23, 2003, Spencer Tillman, a former NFL football player who became a sports analyst for CBS, testified before the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance regarding the insurance policy that Camelot Music maintained on the life of his brother, Felipe. Felipe was a low-level employee of Camelot Music who had not worked for Camelot Music for many years prior to his death. That documentary featured interviews with the family of a woman who once worked as a cake decorator for Walmart and died of asthma complications while in her twenties. Her family maintained that they did not receive any portion of the insurance proceeds paid out to Walmart after her death: That segment was one of the most powerful scenes in the film, and its details were among the most memorable. However, Moore clarified that Walmart had long discontinued the practice of obtaining life insurance policies on rank and file employees years earlier following a larger lawsuit initiated by families of deceased employees insured by that giant retail chain. WalMart is contending in an appeal that it was entitled to rely on its expert insurance brokers to warn the company of the inherent dangers of buying COLI policies. WalMart has asked the high court to revive its bad-faith and breach-of-duty claims against its insurers, which the Delaware Chancery Court had dismissed. And although the proceeds of such policies previously paid out after the deaths of low-level employees on occasion funded executive salaries, their primary purpose was not to generate corporate profits based upon higher worker mortality rates. has long been engaged in the battle against misinformation, an effort we could not sustain without the support of our readers.

The Missouri River is a major source of drinking water. The Belle Fourche Pipeline is operated by True Companies. But critics have been quick to point out that this spill is not the worst of 2016. Oil prices in the Southeast surged and motorists endured long lines and shortages after the leak resulted in disruption and left the pipeline out of service until late September. The disaster was largely contained, as gasoline was released into a retention pond. There were no deaths or injuries related to the leak. However, the refined gas did head dangerously close to the Peel Creek, a tributary of the Cahaba River, according to the Weather Channel. However, this would be the last time Shelby County caught a break in 2016, as the Colonial Pipeline would later catch a literal one. There were no deaths or injuries resulting from the leak or fire, and as a result, it occurred quietly with little incident or coverage. Six workers were on the pipeline when a dirt-moving track hoe struck and created a massive fire that left one worker dead at the scene. Another later died of his injuries. The four other workers were hospitalized, and none of the names of people involved have been released, per the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA). But in October, a pipeline ruptured and sprayed the area with crude oil, a known cause of chemical pneumonia. There were no injuries or evacuations, so the spill was quietly cleaned up after it leaked some 307,734 gallons of crude oil. The pipeline had experienced problems less than a month earlier, according to United Press International and Plains All American Pipeline had reported infrastructure based problems in early October. The pipeline was just over a year old at the time and numerous news outlets reported only 33,000 gallons of crude oil spilling as a result. However, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration reported an initial release of 8,600 barrels of crude oil with only 1,560 barrels being recovered. The company had already been fined for violating welding practices on the line, and federal regulations issued a Corrective Action Order to Sunoco to fix the pipeline, Reuters reported.

U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) focus in the regulatory review process is driven by an old federal statute, the Plant Pest Act. the case of GE crops that entail expression of compounds that act as pesticides, the EPA also has to approve the new crops under national pesticide law. agency's role and authority is seriously limited because Congress has been unable to pass new legislation to give the agencies the tools and mandates needed to conduct thorough reviews of the risks, benefits, costs, and uncertainties associated with novel GE-crop technologies. As a result, pre-approval risk assessments are typically a mile wide but just inches deep. Some of the most worrisome risks are largely ignored. ingredients help keep the active ingredient in suspension, and assure the pesticide sticks to plant or weed tissues long enough to be absorbed or come into contact with an insect pest. For this reason, the impact of inert ingredients are not taken into account when the industry and government conducts a risk assessment of an active ingredient. ingredients help keep the active ingredient in suspension, and assure the pesticide sticks to plant or weed tissues long enough to be absorbed or come into contact with an insect pest.

livelihoods and a wrecked ecosystem. this morning the corporate face of the gulf oil disaster will answer for all of it. we have team coverage of tony hayward's big day on the hill. we will also go to the gulf and show you one method to keep the oil offshore and the burn method. and if you love gulf seafood get ready to pay for it. from the bayou to the beltway. all eyes turn to the ceo of bp. tony hayward, two months ago, barely knew of him. bp's chief executive officer will be in the hot seat on capitol hill. he will arrive on the hill this hour and once again, apologize for the country's worst 9:01 am environmental disaster and in an early release of his statement to congress, he will say he hears, quote, the concerns, fears, frustrations, and anger being voiced across america. we are covering this story from many angles from new orleans to new york and atlanta and to washington. before we go to washington, that testimony beginning about an hour from now, billowing towers of smoke hang over much of the gulf of mexico. and that's a welcomed sight for gulf residents. the smoke is coming from crews that are burning the blankets of oil before they actually reach ashore. ali velshi went out on the water to see the practice of up close and joins us from new orleans. you are seeing thick black smoke burning from oil. that's a good thing because 9:02 am that's oil that's not going to make it to shore. it is being burned. it is being burned in situ, in place. it is a team headed by the coast guard and overseen by the coast guard but private contractors who are out there and hire these shrimpers, take the two boots, attach boom to it, corral the oil and until it is deep enough and sort of together enough. then they ignited it using diesel. a gallon of diesel. they set it on fire and hope it burns. you see the spectacular result of that burning. when we got there yesterday with the coast guard, three hours of -- on a boat on the way in there, we saw seven of these plumes. you can go up and follow them up into the sky and just see endless smoke and it is like tornadic smoke into the sky. the sky around us was bright. but above us was entirely dark. around it, fred, airplanes are circling and monitoring to see 9:03 am where there are better collections of oil and then guiding the fleet. about 15 vessels out there. guiding the fleet to other patches of oil where they start those fires again. we saw about seven fires yesterday burning. very hot and very big fires. they claim they can get thousands of barrels a day out this way. they are going to keep on doing it until there is no more oil to burn. give me an idea what this smoke does to the environment, whether it the water, the wildlife or perhaps even the air quality. liked over. there were fish jumping in the sea. sort of near the oil at an area it already had been burned. i don't know whether they are eating some of the material that has been burned. look, this was not allowed for a long time because there were concerns if you burn this smoke it gets into the atmosphere and it pollute it is environment. it was determined now that it would be better to burn the smoke and create that polltution than allow that oil to move its way to coast because we have seen the damage that that does 9:04 am to wildlife and pelicans. other birds and the shrimp and oyster. the fish. the determination was that it is beer to do this now and it is the better of two evils. there is an epa person on site where this burn sing taking place. the coast guard is making sure that they go around. we went with them and asked them if they are hot, if exhausted. they are taking measurements of their breathing. so far they are reporting lower than aloud incidents of the chemicals that come out burning oil. you can see from that smoke clearly something is going somewhere into the environment. let's go to washington, d.c., where we find senior congressional correspondent dana bash. we know this hearing is taking place an hour from now. tony hayward, ceo of bp is likely to make his way to capitol hill. somewhere within this hour. while we do know based on his early release of the statement, he will give to house members, he is going to apologize and 9:05 am knowledge mistakes were made. he's really got to expect that he will be the subject of a firing squad. if he was listening to anything that the senior members of the committee were saying, especially there democrats before happened, i talked to the chairman of the committee holding this hearing at the top of the hour. i asked him about the fact that tony hayward the man before him, will be sitting alone at the witness table, has sort of become not only the poster child but in many ways the villain of this whole drama and disaster. he said whether or not that's true, he said he is not sure but bart stupak did say that he's worried and warning tony hayward not to come before this committee as a typical corporate at executive saying he's sorry, saying he didn't know dash congressman stupak and other members of congress here say they are not going to stand for that and they want answers to what happened and what led to this explosion. not necessarily a congressional hearing. i don't know what happened at the white house other than congratulations to the president and bp for disagreement but members are -- going to take his hide off as they should. these are top engineers. crazy well. runaway wells. nightmare. keep moving forward. cut corners. get it done. create a bigger nightmare. he's the head of the corporation. he goes down with the ship, as they say. in this case, they pay him well for having this responsibility. now it is time for him to accept it. specifically, five areas where they said that bp cut corners in crucial, crucial moments before the explosion. and so what he -- what con man stupak told me is that he expects tony hayward to be able to answer questions about why those things happened and he said he won't believe that hayward in this situation when this rig was 43 days overdue and going to its next stop and millions and millions of dollars overbudget doesn't believe he didn't know some of these cost-cutting decisions that ultimately led to this horrible 9:08 am disaster according to congressman stupak. one quick color -- tell you about color here. you can probably see a lot of hustling and bustling while i was talking. the security here is not like it is for a normal ceo. we sometimes are kind of kept at bay when you have members of the president's cabinet or dignitaries. not when you see executives of companies. that's going on right here. there definitely is stepped-up security. so it is -- very noteworthy that this definitely feels not just from our perspective but from the people who are putting on this hearing and the people who secure the capitol, this is not. tony hayward and others enter and take their seats, they first have to listen to opening remarks coming from a number of the house members before tony hayward gets to go through the 11-page statement, perhaps even more if he's added a few more 9:09 am notes. then there's more question and answer coming from members of congress. what's going to be interesting and we saw this earlier this week when he had the five ceos at the five major oil companies before the same committee and same committee room is that tony hayward is going to be sitting at that desk alone. listening to the opening statements of all of the panel members and it will likely take an hour, hour and a half and will have to listen to this before he even gets a chance to speak or before he raises his hand and is sworn in under oath. and then the barrage of questioning will begin. he will have a good sense of where the pan sell coming from if he doesn't already before he gets top his mouth. dana bash, we will check back with you periodically throughout the morning on capitol hill there. so the hearing before that house energy commerce subcommittee is set to get under way next hour. cnn, of course, obtained the opening statement i have been referring to that hayward will be presenting to lawmakers. here is a bit more of what he is expected to say before being grilled by lawmakers. bp's chief executive says, 9:10 am quote, the explosion and fire aboard the deep water horizon is and the resulting oil spill in the gulf of mexico should never have happened. i am deeply sorry that they did. hayward goes on to say that he was, quote, personally devastated when he learned 11 men had lost their lives and in his words, quote, my sadness has only grown as the disaster continues. end quote. we will have much more of that on capitol hill and beyond. also, coming up, death by firing squad. you don't hear that too often. but that's how the man in this orange jumpsuit is set to be executed in just a few hours. we are taking a look at how it will happen after this. or any , you can feed a family of four. comfort suites. power up. limit the cell phone minutes. that's not good enough. we're not leaving this room unless we can cut something else. all this stuff. time, effort, people. trust your business processes to xerox. xerox. ready for real business. this is power with efficiency. this is an interior that exceeds even the promise of the exterior. this is the all-new jaguar xj. the stunning result of taking a very different road. 9:12 am we make meeting times, lunch times and conference times. but what we'd rather be making are tee times. tee times are the official start of what we love to do. the time for shots we'd rather forget, and the ones we'll talk about forever. in michigan long days, relaxing weather and more than 800 pristine courses make for the perfect tee time. because being able to play all day is pure michigan. your trip begins at michigan.org. fidelity investments. turn here. literally. sounds like wild west style justice. but just after midnight, a double murder in utah is scheduled to be hooded, strapped to a chair, shot through the heart by a string of unnamed marksmen. 49-year-old ronnie lee gardner is now asking for a last-minute stay from the tenth u.s. circuit court and u.s. supreme court. and if they don't intervene, the state supreme court, gardner will be the first person to die by firing squad in the u.s. in 14 years. he could be one of the last. utah officials say that ronnie gardner's life was troubled early on. by the age of 6 he was a drug addict and sent to a mental institution. at 23 he killed a bartender 9:15 am during a robbery in 1985 while heading into a courtroom in connection with that case, he murdered attorney michael burdell and shot a bailiff. nate, thanks so much for joining us. give me an idea of logistically how this will happen and really how did it come to this firing squad. shortly after midnight. he will be strapped into a chair. there will be a paper target placed over his heart. and then gardner will be allowed to say a few final words. and then a hood will be placed over his head. and five gunmen will be given the order to fire. 9:16 am ordinarily people think about the death penalty in this country, they have become conditioned with lethal injection. the electric chair. no question about that. this was the preferred method in utah for -- since pioneers entered the valley. and for one reason or another the legislature didn't do away with it until 2004. at that point they made -- lethal injection the only option. so now i understand that gardner is asking for a stay of execution. viewers heard a little bit about 9:17 am that. gardner thinks if jury members knew about his early drug use, about possible brain damage he suffered, that they would have voted for life in prison rather than death. give me an idea of how the marksmen came to be and what are the details. we don't know who those are going to be. there's about 400 officers in that office. it could possibly be any one of them. the sheriffs said in the past 9:18 am they had so many volunteers they have to have a lottery. and then -- four of them will have a live round. they all have 30 caliber rifles and don't know which of them has the blank. and then past procedures, one of the five has been designated the captain. when everything is ready, the captain will sound off in a cadence. and at the end of that cadence, they are supposed to fire in unison. all right. thanks so much. it is scheduled for midnight. you are scheduled to be a witness for the execution by firing squad. thanks so much. we will tell you what one actually did to the storm chaser who got these images. 9:19 am live pictures of capitol hill. soon ceo of bp tony hayward will be making his way to capitol hill for a house subcommittee hearing. he will be trying to apologize once again and trying to answer many questions, not just lawmakers have, but members of the general public have also. that promise to make my patients look younger. but nothing works like this. exclusive ion2 complex combines with the activating cream to boost collagen depleted skin. amazing. that's

creations. 9:21 am 9:22 am a look at our top stories. day 59 of the gulf of mexico oil disaster. the expectation is there will be fireworks on capitol hill this morning. bp chief executive officer tony hayward testifies before lawmakers who are outraged at the company's response to the oil spill. severe weather strikes the northwestern part of south dakota. take a look at the images. storm chaser andy gabrielson spotted eight tornadoes. all within on few miles of each other. he says one of those tornadoes almost lifted his car. the maker of benadryl and tylenol is adding five more types of drugs to the company's list of recalled products. the voluntary recall was made because of a chemical odor with the product's shipping palette. 9:23 am live pictures now of capitol hill of -- actually, threes not live. what you are seeing are taped pictures of bp's ceo tony hayward among others. but tony hayward today will be in the hot seat on capitol hill and will be testifying among -- to the house energy subcommittee. he will try to apologize for the bp disaster. he will be acknowledging mistakes. he says, of course, there are lots of questions like how could this have happened. he still does not have a complete answer to that. he, too will be riddled with a number of questions from many angry lawmakers. he will be on capitol hill later on this hour to testify in the next hour as well. we will have much more on that here in the newsroom. only from at&t. 9:25 am 9:26 am talk show host oprah winfrey is defending president obama's handling of the gulf coast oil disaster. she also expressed heartfelt concern for the devastation in that region. don lemon caught up with oprah in atlanta yesterday. you have been so supportive of the folks down south and what's going on with the oil. we can only hope and pray that this will soon be resolved in a way that people can pick themselves up and begin to move forward. i really don't understand what people want him to do. i think that he's the president of the united states. you are not supposed to be emotional. you are supposed to take action and get things done. and make sure those things happen. i really don't know what it is people want him to do. so i think that all of us being united in our sense of understanding, what is going on, what's happening no only to the people but animals which is what breaks my heart. we will break down the numbers and see how this all might work. now the ceo of bp is expected to be on capitol hill. he's to arrive there momentarily to testify before the house, energy and subcommittee. he will be apologizing according to material release of his statement and ex-plan even he is still looking for answers for many questions that still continue to riddle much of 9:29 am america. much

posed from lawmakers with the house subcommittee of energy and commerce. posing these questions to the ceo tony hayward of bp. he's expected to stick with his 11-page script. he has a statement that we have also been privy to where he will apologize profusely, acknowledge mistakes have been made involving bp and the oil spill that took place. now 59 days ago. i'm joined in washington by my colleague john king. john, while we see this 11-page testimony that tony hayward will be sticking to, this really is 9:33 am going to be an aside because the lawmakers have a host of questions. they want to know what bp knew about this. what was their contingency plan why they didn't have a better contingency plan for an accident like this to happen while drilling a 5,000 feet below. his statement of apology is no way going to soften the blow of questioning from these lawmakers. good morning to you. this will be a day of great drama in washington. the big question is will it be a day we get any new details about what happen order the deep-water horizon on april 20th. and perhaps any new details about how optimistic or pessimistic mr. hayward is when they will able to stop that leak. remember this. as he testifies today, this is america's favorite new villain. this committee is going to treat him like a pinatta. we will have at least an hour before we hear from mr. hayward. you can be sure none of them 9:34 am will be complimentary to mr. hayward and bp. the question is when we get to him and the questioning, this is a committee that has thousands of pages of documents from bp. the committee believes what happen order this rig was negligent, if not criminal. they say it was behind schedule, overbudget, pressure to get the job done and leaders on the rig, bp officials ignored warnings from the staff that they had a problem and should shut things down. mr. hayward is the ceo of a publicly traded company whose stock has fallen in value by half since the disaster. anything that he says will affect the value of the company. there are criminal investigations of the company and potential of dozens of civil lawsuits. anything he says can and will be used against him in a court of law down the road. so this is a ceo who while he has to be there, he understands his obligation to the american people to testify before the congress, he's going to be very, very careful. he's also a guy, though, this is why this could be so dramatic, who has made mistakes in his 9:35 am public statements in the past. early on he told sky news this would be a very modest environmental impact but also said bp would be a model in its response after this. he famously said at one point i want my life back. i have for you before i break some of our others into the conversation, i want on show you this. we brought this t-shirt back from may trip to the gulf coast. tony hayward has become the poster child for the outrage of bp about this. to that point i want to bring our national political correspondent jessica yellen into the conversation. for congress they see a chance to score points with the american public. it's both a fact-finding mission because they do want to get some answers. and this is the first time hayward has been in to testify. they can get some answers, though we all know he has to be cautious and guarded with reasons you point out. a lot of it is theater. mine, think back to not so long ago, the goldman sachs hearing where we saw all the members of 9:36 am congress supposed to be doing oversight during the years that the financial crisis was unraveling. and suddenly there's -- they are so indignant and outraged this was going on under their noses. i think we will see that again today where we hear this indignant rage, washington theater, and you have to ask congress had a role in this, too. oh, my gosh, we have to look at this agency. let's go to capitol hill. senior congressional correspondent dana bash had an exclusive interview with the chairman of the subcommittee and can give us a sneak peek of what we are about to hear. look, he made very clear, talking about bart stupak, who will be chairing this hearing, made very clear that apologies are not going to be enough. that what they want, particularly the democrats on 9:37 am this committee, when they want from tony hayward, detailed answers. they gave him the answers to the test. what this committee did on monday, they sent him a 14-page letter going through the narrative that this committee has built through its investigation. and into what they say five incidents that they call crucial incidents where corners were cut and costs were -- tried to save costs for time and for money and you name it. where they say that -- those were the -- crucial, crucial times that perhaps led to this explosion and would -- congressman stupak told me is he doesn't buy that tony hayward, head of the company, such a massive project was going on, 43 days behind schedule, millions of dollars overbudget, he didn't know about why these corners were cut. that's, i think, going to be one of the major thrusts of the questions. really looking back at culpability and as many of these members have said, they want to 9:38 am build a record to show that bp from their perspective really does have a lot of culpability in what happen. maybe in the country you don't think they are important to you, just those of us that cover washington. this is an american problem. indeed an international problem. nowhere more do they xwar what they might hear today and answers they are looking for today along the gulf coast. that's where cnn's chris lawrence is now and is live in new orleans. one, emotional level and the second thing on a specific level. under the emotional level, they want to hear something from the bp official that speaks to him understanding what he's caused here, what the company caused down here. fishing, food, more than just industries down here. they are really engrained in the culture and part of the way of life down here. i think on an emotional level they want to see some understanding of the damage that's been caused. more specifically, i have been talking to a lot of small businesses. especially the supporting businesses, not necessarily just the workers that work on the rig. a lot of they want to hear some specific assurances that they are going to get their money. you know, historically in spills like this, small businesses often end up in years of litigation, recovering just a fraction of their losses. and a lot of people here have been telling me that they will -- they are going to get their money, when bp says they are going to get their money, they say i will believe that when i see it. so you mentioned earlier about saying things on the record, statements that can then come back to haunt you, so to speak. i think a lot of people here want to hear statements on the record from the bp's ceo that 9:40 am locks the company in to paying some of the damages that some of the businesses have suffered here. you know, i don't want to by any means, you know, i don't want to say, you know, frustration and anger here is only directed at bp. you know, as much praise as we have lavished on admiraled that allen and some, you know, justifiably so for the job he has done, there's frustration about the coast guard. feeling the coast guard has not taken the reins of leadership, used some of its authority and power that a lot of people here felt they had and felt that the coast guard and the administration, especially early on but even, you know, up until the last couple of weeks, just 9:41 am too cozy with bp and not champion challenging them enough. we can show you live pictures of the committee hearing where tony hayward, bpceo, in 20 minutes will be sitting down. as we go to break, remember the picture in the middle. as the bp ceo testifies today, sad fact is oil, millions of gallons of oil, continue to spew into the gulf of mexico. two months from now the company says will be the earliest they will able to shut it off completely. p your skin get healthy and

the arrival p bp's ceo tony 9:45 am hayward. he is in the hot seat today. he is to testify today in part to apologize, to acknowledge mistakes were made and also make promise that bp will try to do right as we are now in day 59 of the continued oil leak in the gulf of mexico. we have team coverage on the testimony on capitol hill and the ripple effect from coast to coast. let's begin with christine. break it down for us. for the united states government saying to bp we want to make sure the money is there. we want to make sure you are 9:46 am going to pit for the victims of this spill and that there will be money available. this is unprecedented. this is simply -- have never seen a government sort of demand -- this government in particular demand money set aside from a company like this to cover an unprecedented problem. well, yes. i mean, up until the april 20th spill, this company's financial statements clearly show it was a cash machine. it has lines of credit for that. and keep in mind, it also has other things here. 9:47 am they will be paying that money for being share holders and will cutback on research and development on the capital expenditures and more money available along those lines. it identified places where there is an awful lot of money and scope there to fill this nubd r fu fund but also to pay for what's happening now, cap the well, relief wells. try to immediately burn off oil that's spilling into the gulf of mexico. so very wide range of estimates, fredricka about what that oil you are seeing on your screen right now is going to do, how much cost damage it will be. no one really knows for sure. bp says that it can and will pay. however, the oil continues to gush. this as ceo of bp, tony hayward, will be making his way to capitol hill for that testimony to begin. our live coverage continues after this. it nt neti dne. pyte veen. on fm mps. 9:49 am that's why we're investing one million dollars every hour... to improve our technology

welcome back to the newsroom. i'm frederica whitfield in atlanta. live pictures of all points. in the center, capitol hill in the nation's capital as they await the bp ceo tony hayward. he is to testify today and acknowledge in his words that the oil spill in the gulf is 9:52 am unacceptable and that his sadness grows, and in his words during an 11-page statement he is expected to read, that he will not rest until the well is under control. we have team coverage of the testimony that is expected to be rather fiery on capitol hill today before a house energy and commerce subcommittee. we have team coverage from atlanta to the gulf coast and to washington as well. this is likely to be a very fiery, tough testimony for mr. hayward. i hope he has got his mitchell on today. we should make clear to our viewers it will be a while before they hear in mr. hayward because the angry committee members want to make opening statements and you can be sure they will not be kind to the ceo or to his company. 9:53 am let's bring in someone who has the perspective of what it's like to lead a big oil company and to be in the situation tony hayward is in today. john hofmeister is with us today. explain first and foremost as someone who led a big company, they want answers but tony hayward has to worry about shareholders and the markets and potential criminal and civil lawsuits. try not to make your position any worse in your testimony. he will clearly be on the back foot. hofmeister, i'm sorry. i want to interrupt for a second. we are watching mr. hayward pass through the security, the visitor's entrance. mr. hayward was in the shot and then stepped out. to our viewers, as we continue the conversation with mr. hofmeister, you may see tony 9:54 am hayward coming into capitol hill. like everyone else, including reporters and visitors, he has to go through a bit of security. don't dig your hole any deeper. he'll do a lot of listening, undoubtedly and hear passionate remarks from very respectable people, who really do feel as they are expressing themselves. also, there's a bit of theater in all of this as well. if there was true culpability here, not just for bp for the blowout but for the u.s. congress and its failure to set energy policy in motion which enables us to deliver on the energy independence which we've been promised for almost 40 years, the american people ought to be having a hearing with congress about why have you failed u.s.s a a leadership group in terms of enabling an energy policy that doesn't push us into the high risk deepwater in the first place. you are looking at bp ceo tony hayward. he just enared the hearing room and he will be grilled and will offer an opening statement in which he apologizes. i want to continue to the conversation. congress has an oversiblt obligation. they should look in the mirror because they have promised for a long time going back to jimmy carter that they have not delivered to the american people on the energy always. i want to talk about the industry that you have worked in for some time because one of the seeds of this disaster is it what many describe is an incestuous relationship between the oil industry and the mms, which is supposed to regulate that agency, a revolving door of people going through, corruption and bribery and the like. there was a 2007 inspector general report that talked about some isolated instances in colorado, and that has been magnified in painting the entire industry with a broad brush stroke. i think people are using anecdotal evidence to suggest there is a permeating corruption across the industry. i didn't experience it. for the three years running that my company attempted to get permits from the mms to drill off the coast of alaska. for three years running, we failed to get the permits because the environmental requirements kept changing, and we were always rushing to catch up to the new definitions or the new standards being put in place and i did not find a cozy relationship whatsoever, and i can't deny things may have happened but i can't recognize this as a broad brush way of behaving within the mm schlts. as we watch the pictures, this is the prelude. this is the coming attractions in the movie theater. we see tony hayward with staff and attorneys in the room. we see journalists in the room. the members are beginning to come in. this is america's new villain at the moment. fairly or unfairly, the american people, and especially the people in the gulf coast -- the mention of his name causes outright visceral anger. a huge challenge for him and also a challenge for the congress. it's a performance for both of them as you point out. it's in no way criminal but it's a bit like a court case where they want to hear does the suspect show remorse. is he going to come on and express in adequate terms how much he understands what people are going through. 9:58 am we've seen bp officials start to do that increasingly in recent days, especially yesterday at the white house, expressing how sorry they are in very compassionate terms. you know, there is clearly nothing he's going to say today that's going to satisfy americans' outrage. it's really about not saying anything, as the ceo and how mun congress show how angry they are. this committee has thousands of documents from bp that the committee says proves that this deepwater horizon rig was behind schedule and bp wanted to move onto another project and rushed ahead and ignored warnings from their subcontractors, including halliburton. you see the drama, bp kills, bp lies. and mostly in the gulf coast. that's where we find ali velshi. we were together along the coast, and we both visited small towns where the fishermen and oystermen, and they look out at the waters and personalize it. they believe that hayward and his company not only sent millions of gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico and destroyed their way of life. when you go out there, you see a busy place for the first 50 miles or so into the gulf of mexico. there's a lot of activity, a lot of people working with the fish and oil. those people we talked to earlier this week have three concerns. one, stop the oil from coming out, two, stop the oil from getting to the shore, and three, do something to protect the wildlife in the marshes and shrimp and oysters that they have to collect. one thing you don't see from 10:00 am shore is yesterday i went out with the coast guard to burn the oil gathered around the spill site. it's about 3 to 12 miles from the site of the deepwater horizon. they are collecting these oil in booms and burning them. this is actually, john, a relative success in this operation. they are burning on some days -- we only know this anecdote tale, up to 5,000 barrels of oil an hour and up to 30,000 or 40,000 barrels a day. you see a success burning the oil so it doesn't get to shore and kill pelicans and shrimp and oysters. you also see a big, big plume of smoke in the area, and everybody says, what are we doing to the environment with the smoke. can you imagine we are in a place where we decided it is less dangerous to burn the oil and have the pollution go into the air than to have that oil go to shore and continue to damage 10:01 am more wildlife, more seafood and affect the livelihoods of people around here. this is very personal in this part of the gulf. this isn't about political decisions and who to blame. this is about stop the oil, give me my sea back. this is jens ragsal. these people say my grandfather, my father worked these waters or some worked in the oil industry. one thing we don't know, the biggest question you noted is, when, when, when will they stop the flow of oil into the gulf and then you have the environmental and economic impact. we don't know the ill pact on the tuna or sea turtles. commercial and environmental interests are in two separate areas. here they are not. now they have the moratorium on the oil industry, the oil industry has a bad name. they're mad at the oil industry but if you can't get shrimp or oysters, the other job is working in the oil industry. they are very, very krned they are getting hit on both sides, and the environment and economy have come together as one story in the gulf of mexico. on the right side of your screen, that is the house committee hearing room, and bart stupak has just taken his seat. we will go to that hearing. that's bart stupak in the middle, a retiring member of congress. he has decided not to run for re-election. 10:03 am first, let's check in with ed lavandera, he's down in kenner, louisiana. i'm getting the pulse as we're watching tony hayward begin to testify, kind of get a sense of how people are reacting to it. he has a lot of people's hearts to win over in this city and state. the hearing is just getting under way. we want to take you into the house committee hearing room right now. today we have a hearing entitled 10:04 am the role of bp in the deepwater horizon explosion and oil spill. we have a lot of members present who are not members of subcommittee but are meshes of the full energy and commerce committee. i welcome them and note that they will be allowed to submit written statements for the record but will not deliver verbal opening statements. after all subcommittee members complete their questions, full committee members will be allowed to ask questions. people who are not on the committee or subcommittee will be allowed to observe but will not be allowed to offer opening statements or ask questions due to time constraints. the chairman and ranking member will be recognized for five minute statements. other members will be recognized for three-minute opening statements. i will yield to the chairman of the full committee, mr. waxman, for the first opening statement. 10:05 am chairman. thank you for holding this important hearing. and mr. hayward, thank you for being here today. i'm sure that was not an easy decision for you but they were the right ones and i commend you for them. we are examining the committees for the spill. some are working on the reorganization of the regulatory agencies, and some, including chairman marquee's subcommittee are drafting legislation to reform our oil exploration laws. you are testifying today before the oversight and investigation subcommittee and this subcommittee has a special role, to examine the facts and determine what went wrong and to 10:06 am make recommendations to prevent future spills. when it's time for questioning, i and other members of the subcommittee will ask you about a series of internal bp documents. they appear to show that bp repeatedly took shortcuts that endangered lives and increased the richks of a catastrophic blowout and i sent you a letter in advance indicating that we're going to question you about those issues. but what is equally important is what is missing from the documents. when you became ceo of bp you promised to focus like a laser on safe and reliable operations. we wanted to know what you had done to keep this promise, so we asked what e-mails you had received, what documents you had reviewed about the deepwater horizon rig or the mkcando well 10:07 am before the blowout. deepwater drills is inherently dangerous as the entire country now knows. an uncontrolled blowout can kill rig workers and cause an environmental disaster. we want to know whether you were briefed about the risks and were monitoring the safety of the drilling operation. we could find no evidence that you paid any attention to the tremendous risks bp was taking. we've reviewed 30,000 pages of documents from bp, including your e-mails. there is not a single e-mail or document that shows you paid even the slightest attention to the dangers at this well. you are the ceo, so we consider the possibility that you may have delegated the oversight responsibility to someone else. we reviewed the e-mails and briefing documents received by 10:08 am andy englis and doug suttles, the chief operating officer for exploration and production, and the person now leading bp's response to the spill. according to bp, these are the senior officials who are responsible for the mecondo well, but they, too, were apparently oblivious to what was happening. we could find no evidence that either of them received any e-mails or briefings about the deepwater horizon rig or drilling activities at the well. bp's corporate complacency is astonishing. the drilling engineer for the rig called mecando a nightmare well. other bp employees predicted that the cement job would fail. halliburton warned of a severe 10:09 am gas flow problem. these warnings fell on deaf ears. bp's corporate attitude may best be summed up in an e-mail from its operations drilling engineer who oversaw bp's team of drilling engineers after learning of the risks and bp's decision to ignore them, he wrote, quote, who cares, end of story, we'll probably be fined end quote. there is a complete contradiction between bp's words and deeds. you were brought in to make safety the top priority of bp, but under your leadership bp has taken the most extreme risks. bp cut corner after corner to save a million dollars here, a few hours or days there, and now the whole gulf coast is paying the price. today's hearing will focus on bp's actions, but we learned 10:10 am from our hearing earlier this week that the other oil companies are just as unprepared to deal with a massive spill as bp. we are seeing in the oil industry the same corporate indifference to risk that caused the collapse on wall street, and that is why reform is so urgently needed. part of this reform must be to put teeth into our regulatory system and also our transition to a clean energy economy. we're addicted to oil. this addiction is fouling our beaches, polluting our atmosphere and undermining our national security. we can't snap our fingers or transform our energy economy overnight but we need to start down a path to a clean energy future. mr. chairman, i look forward to today's hearing, and mr. hayward, i thank you for appearing and cooperating with our investigation. mr. burgess and i will do our opening next. chairman and thank you, mr. hayward, for appearing before us. we have kind of a dual track under way in my opinion. we obviously are trying to gather the facts of what happened in the oil spill in the gulf of mexico a month and a half ago, trying to mind out the causes of that spill, what can be done to prevent it in the future. we are obviously very concerned about the mitigation and the cleanup. we have a system in america built up based on the british tradition over 200 years of due process and fairness where people that do bad things, in 10:12 am this case, a corporation that's responsible for a bad accident oh we want to hold them responsible, do what we can to make the liable parties pay for the damages. mr. stupak and mr. waxman are doing an excellent job working with dr. burgess and myself in conducting, i think, a very fair oversite investigation, and we're going to get into a number of those issuesen in hearing, and we're going to ask you some pretty tough questions. i'm speaking now totally for myself. i'm not speaking for the republican party or anybody in the house of representatives but myself. but i'm ashamed of what happened in the white house yesterday. if i called you into my office and i had the subcommittee chairman, mr. stupak, with me, who was legitimately conducting an oversight investigation on your company and said, if you put so many millions of dollars in a project in my congressional district, i could go to jail. and should go to jail. 10:14 am now, there is no question that british petroleum owns this lease. there is no question that bp -- i'm sorry, it's not british petroleum anymore -- that bp made decisions that objective people think compromise safety. there is no question that bp is liable for the damages. but we have a due process system where we go through hearings and in some cases court cases and litigation and determine what those damages are and when those damages should be paid. so i'm only speaking for myself and not speaking for anybody else, but i apologize. i do not want to live in a country where anytime a citizen or a corporation does something that is legitimately wrong is 10:15 am subject to some sort of political pressure that is, again in my words amounts to a shakedown. so i apologize. but on this hearing today i am with mr. waxman, with mr. stupak. there are answers that need to be -- questions that need to be asked that are legitimate because we don't want another oil spill of this magnitude in the gulf of mexico, and if there is anything that can be done to prevent this type of an accident in the future, then we have done our work for the american people. with that, mr. you just had your first wow of the day. this is the third hearing the subcommittee has held and the fifth hearing overall in the energy and commerce committee. our first hearing exposed problems with the blowout preventer and several other problems related to the disaster. our second hearing was a field hearing that contributed to -- our second hearing was a field hearing in new orleans where we heard from the widows of two men who died in the deepwater horizon explosion as well as shrimpers and others who shoved in the environmental catastrophe that followed. our staff has spent weeks combing through hundreds of thousands of documents and sitting through briefings by corporate, academic and scientific experts to find out 10:17 am what went wrong in the exploration of the mecando well. we have considered decisions may by bp in the hours and minutes before the explosion. what we learned is alarming. we learned that time after time, bp had warning signs that this was a nightmare well as one employee put it. bp made choices that set safety aside in exchange for cost cutting and time saving results. bp disregarded questionable results from pressure after cementing in the well. bp selected the riskier of two options. they could have hung a line from a casing already in the well and installed a tie back on the top of the liner which would have provided additional barriers for the release of hydrocarbons but entered if you string which cost less and took less time but did not provide the same protection against escaping hydrocarbons. 10:18 am halliburton said that the well could have a severe gas flow problem if bp lowered the final string of casing with only six centralizers instead of the 21 that halliburton recommended. bp rejected the advice to use additional centralizers in an e-mail on april 16th. bp employee said it will take ten hours to install them. i don't like it. bp chose not to fully circulate the mud in the well from the bottom to the top which was an industry recommended best practice that would have allowed them to test for gas in the mud. bp chose not to use a chase casing hanger lockdown sleeve which would have provided extra protection from a blowout from below. these are a few of the issues that led to the disaster. once deepwater horizon exploded and sank to the bottom of the 10:19 am sea, bp's response to contain the leak and clean up the spill was equally as poor. they issued law-ball estimates of the amount of oil flowing from the well which may have led to a scaled-back response. we discovered that bp's oil response plan was virtually identical to other oil companies' plans. rex tiller son admitted that once the spills occur, he says, quote, we are not well equipped to handle them end of quote. all of the other companies testified at tuesday's hearings that they would not have drilled the well as bp did. our witness today, mr. tony hayward, is the chief executive officer of bp. shortly after he took over as the ceo in 2007, he held a town haul meetings in houston and discussed that bp needed to be the leader with fewer people in the process. 10:20 am an article from september 27th, 2007, guardian newspaper in london, hayward says oil company has become too cautious reads, and i quote, assurance is killing us. mr. hayward told u.s. staff, noting that too many people were engaged in decision making, leading to excessive cautiousness, something that critics of its safety performance in the u.s. might question. let me put up these other notes from the same meeting. we received notes from bp and from employees and their note taking. the employee notes summarize mr. hayward's statements as follows, i don't think all of these layers of assurance reduces risk. the best way to reduce risk is to have deepwater competence where we need it. individuals need to be responsible for risk and to manage it end quote. i find this cavalier atud unbelievable, given the fact that bp had just been 10:21 am responsible for the largest leak in alaska on the north slope as well as the 2005 texas refinery which killed 14 workers and injured another 170. i must ask whether it was wise to adopt this leaner decision making process with input from fewer people and a new approach to managing risk. under the leadership of the former president of bp america, bp created an independent office of the ombudsman headed by stantry sporkman. line members feared retaliation if they reported safety concerns to management. when lamar mckay took over, i suggested that he hoped to improve the culture enough to make the ombudsman office unnecessary so he could shut it down. i urged him not to eliminate the office because it serves a 10:22 am significant role in investigating employee complaints. i'm more concerned now than ever about bp's safety and the role they take in assuming risk. i'm concerned that the corporate culture from tony hayward down to lamar mckay and chief operating officer that they are willing to take risk. i look forward to hearing the answers from tony hayward from the many questions our committee members will ask today. i hope for contrite substantive answers. you owe it to all americans. we are not small people but we wish to get our lives back. for the americans that live and work on the gulf coast, it may be years before they get their lives back. for the americans who lost their lives on the rigs, their families may never get their lives back. mr. hayward, i'm sure you will get your life back and with a golden parachute back to london. 10:23 am we in america are left with the consequences of bp's recklessness. i yield back my time to mr. burgess for an opening statement. this hearing provides the subcommittee withen opportunity to question the man who leads bp, mr. tony hayward, the e company's chief executive officer. bp has been central to the incident and the response. over the course of the inquiry to date, committee members have conducted numerous interviews and briefings and reviewed tens of thousands of pages of documents. our staff has done an excellent 10:24 am job and this subcommittee has been focused on gathering facts rather than rushes to judgment. we have begun to identify a number of serious questions about bp's decision making that led up to the disaster. exploring these and related questions today will epius identify. tony hayward and the ranking member giving his opening statement and of course on the left of the screen why we're here, the continuing leaking and spewing of millions of gallons of oil into the gulf of mexico. our first wow of the hearing came up a short time ago. 10:25 am most of what you will hear is sharp criticism of bp. you heard that from bart stupak who says he has eveils and documents that say bp was interested in cutting costs and not worried about safety. i want to bring into the conversation first our national political correspondent jessica yellin. i said at the beginning i did not expect mr. hayward to get any kind words. i was wrong. there is a sense in the conservative movement that government should be muscular and aggressive in a crisis and come in and, frerks, clean up a spill which is one thing the government can't handle well, but stay out of the way when it comes to corporate matters and all other things, that between 10:26 am private citizens and business is, that's not the proper role for the federal government. so no bailout, and no escrow accounts. i wouldn't be surprised if this becomes a huge rallying cry in the tea party movement, another example for them of the way government is being too involved in private industry. also, john hofmeister, the former president of shell oil in houston this morning. i don't see it as a shakedown 10:27 am but as a negotiated solution so work can go forward. so i don't completely agree with congressman barton, but i do question the legality of what happened. it's a goeshs. if you have cooperative agreement between two parties, i don't think there's anything wrong with that. stupak reading the e-mails and minutes and notes from employees that in his view, when mr. hayward became the leader of bp, he says mr. hayward in his view instance stuted a culture in which profits and getting things done took press sengs over safety. when i was president, if people selected just a few words of what i said without the entire context and the meaning, i think it would have led to a different interpretation. we also know that tony hayward 10:28 am made a commitment to the bp organization to institute stronger global processes that had not existed, including a safety management process which was in progress. i don't think it was completed yet. like chevron or exxon or shell, safety management processes are in place to prevent this very thing from happening. i was shocked when i learned about the design of the well, knowing what i know. i'm not a technical person, but i know enough from being around the technical people that you have to put more safeguards into something that is this high pressured, this large of a 10:29 am reservoir. you don't take chances. i will be interested to hear the explanation of why this design was chosen. so far, you had a culture of corporate complacency and that put profits over safety and that led to the deepwater horizon explosion and the tragedy that we see in the gulf of mexico, but from the most senior republican to speak so far, something quite different. hofmeister, joe barton is from where you are. you are in texas today. i assume you have known him a long time. he's an ally of the industry. bp under political pressure sat across the table and negotiated this deal with the white house. why would he call. i know congressman barton has very strong views on this is a nation of laws. there is no law that provides for this. i respect the fact that he has a different opinion but if i were in such a negotiating posture on the back foot, caused the damage, i would look for a way to work cooperatively with the 10:31 am white house without thinking about the laws on the books. we can't lose sight of the fact that the 1984 bhopal disaster and the lawsuits that were related to it were only settled last week. we have to ensure that the citizens of the gulf are 10:32 am protected. the families in the gulf will be crushed financially. unless this compensation fund is put into place. as each day and week and month goes by, the history of these families are going to be altered. and permanently altered unless 10:33 am he are given the financial capacity to take care of their loved ones, their children, their families. that's why this compensation fund is so important. that's why it is not a slush fund. that is why it is not a shakedown. it is, in fact, president obama ensuring that a company which has just spoiled the waters of our nation is made accountable for the harm which is done to our people, a company which said for the first week that it was only 1,000 barrels of oil per day when we now know that they knew it was at least 1,000 to 14,000 barrels. a company which continues to deny there are underwater toxic plumes, a company which has not 10:34 am been providing the proper protective gear for the workers in the gulf, a company which contended it could respond to a spill of 250,000 barrels per day. no, this is not a shakedown of that company. this is the american government, president obama, ensuring that this company is made accountable and sending a signal to all other companies that seek to treat ordinary american families in a way that can destroy their entire family's history. this is, in my opinion, the american government working at its best. this is creating truly the kind of partnership between the public and private sector that could make sure that innocent victims are not road kill as a result of corporate plans that did not actually factor in the 10:35 am harm that can occur to ordinary families. so, i just could not disagree more strongly. i think that this is, in my opinion, one of the most important hearings that this congress will ever have because it is sending a signal to any corporations out there, including the ones that testified on tuesday that all admitted that they had no plans, either, to respond to the harm which could be done in the gulf in one of their rigs had the same kind of catastrophic event, that they will be made accountable. so i thank you mr. chairman for holding this hearing, and i thank you, mr. hayward, because yesterday was the day where the page began to be turned, and we move to a new era. hayward for setting up the fund to help the families in the gulf of mexico. ed markey taking his time to lash back at the leading republican in the room, joe barton of texas. jessica yellin, a partisan fight now breaking out, congressman barton saying this is a shakedown, a slush fund it musseled out of bp. ed markey saying that it's what should happen. i was watching when they cut away to hayward while barton was making this comment. i don't know if a foreigner would understand the domestic politics of the tea party movement versus the democratic party. it i will point out it brings to 10:37 am mind he has hired some top democratic pr firms and democratic lawyer in this town to give him advice. now you have a gentleman from the gulf coast, darryl willis. he is the face of bp in its television advertising. john hofmeister, the former president of shell oil is with us in houston. it's very typical of a what i experienced. the partisanship that plays out in hearings can often times be truly disgraceful in the sense that it gets in the way of creating sound public policy. the american people need energy. the american people need a way 10:38 am forward. we have a team of reporters across the gulf of mexico. we are continuing to wait for the testimony from tony hayward on the top right of your screen, and he will testify that they still don't know what caused the continued spewing of oil into the gulf of mexico. he will say he is sorry. we are going to take a quick break. 10:40 am you are watching live pictures. tony hayward listening now to opening statements. members of the house subcommittee. he will testify in a short bit but first is listening to testimony from members of the committee. that is john dingell of michigan. i do not like this. i'm very concerned about using it. so, also, were we. on the same matter, bp's operations drilling engineers said, even if the hole is perfectly straight, a straight piece of pipe even in tension will not sink the center of the hole unless it has something to centralize it. i want you to listen to this. but who cares. it's done. end of story. it will probably be fine, and note the word probably, and we'll get a good cement job. i would rather have to squeeze than get stuck. mr. chairman, the comments of our witness today reveal little sorrow for the events that have occurred and here he said, the gulf of mexico is a very big ocean. the amount of volume of oil and dispersant we are putting in is tiny in relation to the total water volume, and, then, the environmental impact of the disaster is likely to be very, very modest. i wonder if he wishes to stand on that statement today. when mr. hayward responded to the claims that cleanup workers were becoming ill because of oil fumes and such, he said this, food poisoning is clearly a big issue. and, finally, most famously, mr. hayward informs us he wants his life back. last year, mr. mr. chairman again, i thank you for your diligence and hard work on this issue. i look forward to hearing from our witnesses today and look forward to working with you on this matter. chairman. next, miss backburn, three-minute opening statement, please. chairman, i thank you and ranking member burgess for holding the hearing, and mr. hayward, i thank you for your willing ms. to testify before this committee. you know, when news of the bp spill began and information about the well started to circulate, it seemed that there was problems not only with bp but also with mms bureaucracy, 10:44 am and that maybe the problem lay there rather than with anything that could have gone wrong with bp, that it was there with mms, and what we've learned and confirmed that that is not correct, that the problem does lie with bp and what went wrong and while there are many faumts with mms and doing its job on inspection and safety oversight, most of the data now presents to wrong decision making by bp's management, and this is not the first time, and we've talked about that in several of our opening statements this morning. this is not the first time that you've been before this kmirtty on safety problems, and certainly as recently as the texas 2005 and alaska '07 incidents which revealed insufficient protocols in bp's management and safety hierarchy. there was a statement particular bp that you all would quote unquote focus like a laser on safety, and it is concerning to us that the appearance is that 10:45 am bp has not learned from previous mistakes. so it leaves us asking the questions of you and of bp, was this accident caused by negligence, was it caused by risk-taking, was it caused by cost-cutting measures by bp decision makers, and unfortunately for citizens, beaches and wildlife all along the coastal region, they are paying a price for those misplaced decisions. bp cannot blame mother nature or equipment failure or even other subcontractors. their actions have put at risk the livelihood of communities and businesses that depend on the gulf. not only for seafood and tourism but also for energy production that this nation as a whole relies upon. in addition, the current administration also shares a 10:46 am significant portion of the blame for the oil spill. i mentioned mm schlts earlier, and the mms officials approved inadequate spill response plans, and field inspectors rubber stach. ed field inspection documents. this is another area where as members of congress doing our due diligence mms why. what is the most damaging is that the president and senior officials knew on day one the blowout preventer was not working and knew of the potential spillage. while bp shoulders much of the responsibility for the spill, the lack of effort by this administration to contain the spill has doomed the economy and wildlife of the gulf coast from an oil spill which could have been contained. and now recently imposed drilling moratoriums will further devastate america's 10:47 am energy production and destroy hundreds of thousands of jobs in the gulf coast region. thank you for being with us today, mr. chairman. i yield the balance of my time. brayly, three minutes, sir. chairman. mr. hayward, you are not going to get a lecture from me today and you're not going to get annal polg, either. we are here to find get answers from you. one of the things that i think we need to know about today is the decisions that your company made. tony hayward will testify shortly but first each member of the committee gets to make a statement. the congressman said he would not lecture but has a list of questions. we have heard democrats mostly scornful saying under mr. hayward bp had a culture of 10:49 am profits, getting things done quickly, putting safety lower on the list. most republicans also say there are tough questions facing bp, but one republican, joe barton of texas said he owed mr. ali velshi is among our correspondents down in the gulf region. as you listen to this, based on your conversations with so many people in the region, obviously they want to hear most from mr. hayward. you discussed it with respect to the claims process. the frustration on the ground, as you know, john, from being around here, these are not people who live high on the hog. these people make a living, and it's something your father did and your kids might do after you. that's the frustration. let's check in back quickly with the hearing on capitol hill. remember, we're watching the oil spill here, but remember just moments ago, they played some sound from the widows. 11 men died on the deepwater horizon, and as they prepare to question mr. hayward, they are reminding him of the stakes. we have an opportunity in this oversight hearing to ask questions that get to the facts of what happened. however, today's hearing is incomplete. we can only ascertain half of the story today because we do not have anyone representing the administration, the mineral management service to discussion their oversight role and their responsibility in assuring that an accident like this didn't happen. deep ocean drilling is not knew. in fact we have been doing it for decades in the gulf coast. if that's the case, why did this not happen in the last decade. why did this occur almost a year and a half into the current administration. we need to hear from our own department of interior and mineral management services. certainly mr. hayward should be prepared to answer for bp's responsibility but we should hear from the administration to implement prudent reforms to return us to safe drilling in our owings because simply saying no is not a realistic answer. i further realize there are some in this administration who have a penchant for not letting a crisis go to waste. we can't take our ball and go home when the consequences mean a weaker america. everyone depending on foreign 10:53 am fuels are all too inclined it seems to let jobs leave this country. no, mr. chairman, we have to under what happened leading up to and on april the 20th. we have to learn in the rules and oversight was insufficient or if this was purely an act of negligence disregard for sound regulations. we can try to enact the perfect reform that ensures this never happens again. we are waiting to hear tony hayward testify. they are saying bp has a lot to answer for but the obama administration has a lot to answer for. it has been in charge fore15 months now and the interior department under this president granted the waiverers and the licenses for the deepwater horizon rig. 10:54 am as we watch the hearing, there is a huge reaction on line to the proceedings as there has been throughout the past eight weeks of the drama. josh levs has this. we're hearing from you, live tweeting. let me show you the examples. i want to know why he thought he would get away with this. i really hope that they do grill him and do it with a lot of heat. people talking about what they want to hear from tony hayward. this grilling serves no purpose. tony hayward is going to tell us what we want to hear and we are going to see our representatives look, indill nant. i'm interested in knowing about the disaster plans for bp's oil rig platforms. a lot of people are saying there is actual information they are hoping to get from the proceedings. congress needs to look at its own regulations and the laws that permed this disaster. tony is not the only guilty 10:55 am party. the truth would be nice for a change. that is from beverly joe. mr. waxman told mr. hayward straight. it's time he is held to account ability. it is sad it happened but it was an accident. chris said that and they are jumping on chris for that. we have time to two little tweets. he should show good faith in helping the affected communities like giving up benefits receiving from bp. we stopped the leak. i don't think he could say anything better. you can send us tweets and facebook messages. join us on the blog throughout the day while everything happens on capitol hill. we will be following those and have more later today. tony hayward is in the hot seat in congress. tony hayward will be testifying in the hour ahead. we are going to take a quick break. 10:56 am 10:57 am 10:58 am welcome back to our special continuing coverage. honeny hayward is at the top right of your screen before the subcommittee on oversight and investigations. he will testify shortly and will deliver testimony in which he will apologize and say bp promises to get to the bottom of it and bp is committed to making right to the people of the gulf coast who have been affected. let's go back now as we wait for tony hayward and listen to the continuing opening statements. you are never as good as they say you are or as bad as they say you are, so this hearing will go back and forth. the other thing i'd like to remind the committee is that the greatest environmental disaster in america has been cigarettes. 10:59 am 60,000 americans today this year will die from cigarette-related cancers. so if we're going to talk about the environment, let's not leave this out. i'm a cancer specialist by training and i never fail to bring that up. the environment is it an important concept. we regret the loss of life and we'll do what we can do. this is not the worst thing that ever happened to america. chairman. at this very moment, oil is gushing from deepwater horizon blowout at a rate between we learned 35,000 and 60,000 barrels a day, killing animals and wiping out entire populations of fish and along with it the jobs of hundreds of thousands of people. most upsetting about this travesty is that it could have been avoided.

Over 50,000 gallons of oil spilled in Yellowstone River 01:01 Story highlights An oil pipeline that crosses the Yellowstone River burst near Glendive, Montana The Yellowstone River is the longest undammed river in the United States (CNN)A Montana pipeline burst sent as much as 50,400 gallons of oil gushing into the Yellowstone River, prompting the governor to declare a state of emergency. Residents in nearby cities were told not to drink the tap water, which some said smelled like diesel. The massive oil spill happened when the 12-inch pipeline, which crosses the Yellowstone River, ruptured Saturday about 5 miles upstream from Glendive, Montana's Department of Environmental Quality said. The Bridger Pipeline company shut down the pipeline. Glendive City Council member Gerald Reichert was among the residents who noticed a disturbing odor in the drinking water. Read More Montana Gov. Steve Bullock announced a state of emergency for Dawson and Richland counties. And while officials wait for results from water sample testing, they're advising residents to use bottled water for drinking and cooking. A host of agencies have responded to the oil spill, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services. Adding to the problems, the weather: the Yellowstone River is partially frozen, making it difficult to clean up the mess. This isn't the first major oil spill into the Yellowstone River -- the longest undammed river in the United States. In 2011, up to 42,000 gallons poured out of a ruptured Exxon Mobil pipeline.

Our concerns were clearly articulated directly to them in a tribal council meeting held on Sept. 30, 2014, where DAPL and the ND Public Service Commission came to us with this route.

Florida Reps. A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies. Macrophages, which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body, protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles. The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants.

The state Health Department, which is monitoring the cleanup, said no water sources were contaminated and no wildlife was hurt from the spill. Dave Glatt, chief of the agency's environmental health section, said Tesoro has not been sanctioned for the incident. Cleanup crews have recovered about 6,000 barrels of oil, though more than 14,000 barrels are lost, officials said. Crews initially burned oil from the surface and later used vacuums to recover it. That proved ineffective after the oil seeped far underground, officials said. Tesoro now is using a thermal desorption process that involves excavating contaminated soil and heating it before being replaced.

Ali published a freelance article commissioned by the HuffPost on August 4 in which multiple sources told Ali that Bolling had sent a litany of unsolicited lewd text messages to Fox News' female employees. Bowe also lists that detail on his Kasowitz biography. According to a New York Times article published in June, Marc Kasowitz represented Trump during the Trump Organization's financial travails in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and has served as his attorney in other recent matters. He even considered setting up an office in the White House, though he serves as Trump's personal attorney and not White House legal counsel. A similar website has been set up in the Resolute Forest Products case. In response to a request for comment from DeSmog, Bowe said that the alleged RICO conspiracy had a global reach.

Florida Reps. A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers. (This may be happening in real-time, too. Exposure can be caused by contact, ingestion or inhalation. Short-term health effects can range from skin irritation and numbness to fever and headaches. Long-term exposure can lead to cancer, liver failure and sperm damage. is traditionally called blue-green algae is actually a class of microscopic organisms called cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria can be toxic and can also produce various types of cyanotoxins that have different hazards. With their small, developing bodies, children are especially endangered by algae exposure. was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption. But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies. Macrophages, which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body, protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles. The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants. That's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA's Office of Inspector General (OIG), the agency's internal watchdog. EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement, and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency.

Thousands of Water Protectors, people from all over the world, have gathered in and around the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation to stop its descent, and terminate the Black Snake. The Missouri River ravaged Omaha, laying waste to the city with frightening efficiency in 1943. In response, Congress passed the Flood Control Act of 1944, commonly known now as Pick-Sloan. The Army Corps of Engineers and Board of Reclamation were assigned responsibility to enact Pick-Sloan and took control of the river. Even for those living right on the Missouri River, the name Pick-Sloan is obscure but no legislation changed the nature of the Missouri more. The government took the opportunity to put a wider, more comprehensive plan covering other commercial and safety aspects of the river in place. Pick-Sloan assigned the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation the task of caring for eight categories related to the river: flood control, navigation, irrigation, power, water supply, recreation, fish and wildlife, and water quality. The Army Corps of Engineers created a gaggle of hydroelectric dams, including Lake Oahe on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Lake Oahe Reservoir and hydroelectric dam was created when the Army Corps of Engineers flooded the fertile river lands and displaced a village on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in 1960. Bison died. Burial grounds were submerged. Homes were lost. Standing Rock encampment. Photo by Mark Charles Just a few miles up the river from Lake Oahe Reservoir are the Water Protector camps. On a hill just above the largest of the Water Protector camps, Oceti Sakowin, the pipeline the pipeline is near completion. Energy Transfer Company, the owner of the Bakken Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), is just waiting for a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to drill under the river and place their pipeline under the river. Wild Water: Flooding is prevented by the Army Corps of Engineers by controlling the flow of water streaming down to Omaha through a series of flood planes, levies, and dams. A tragic, and possibly prophetic event occurred in Michigan in 2010. Black sludge crept from a pipeline for 17 hours before anyone knew it was escaping. Before the spill was confirmed and contained, the million gallons of oil had taken over 40 miles of the river. It was called the Dilbert Disaster. The crew monitoring the pipeline near the Kalamazoo River had ignored several pressure warnings, allowing the oil to flow freely into the river. A hydroelectric dam down river was used to contain the spill. Clumps of oil were still being pulled from the water five years after the spill. The lessons of the Dilbert speak directly to the factors which The Army Corps of Engineers must consider for the Missouri River. The Oahe Reservoir and flood plains, act to stem the tide of water flowing down the river. Flood plains around the river swell as the water builds up during heavy rains, dissipating the water pressure and increasing the width of the river. The dam would be unable to continue to hold both the contaminated water and rushing water from the storm in the event of an oil spill during heavy rain. The flood plains would have to be utilized. Contaminated water would overflow onto the flood plains, greatly increasing the land mass affected by the spill. Even a minor flow onto the flood plains would have a major catastrophic effect on the wildlife. Animals, plants, and vulnerable soils which would otherwise not be affected would be contaminated. Burrows of subterranean plains creatures; rodents, snakes, ground dwelling birds, and insects; would fill with contaminated water, creating vertical contamination. Each vertical tunnel would also have horizontal contamination from soil moisture absorption. Contaminated water could seep several feet underground and have lateral permeation of millions of cubic feet of soil. The animals which survived direct contact with contaminated water would themselves become contaminated. The grass which did not die from the flood or polluted would become begrimed. Animals which eat the grass or the animals in the grass would experience ruinous food shortages from the die off. A large portion of the food left would be contaminated. The contamination of small animals would hit birds of prey, snakes, and coyotes hard. Deer and rodents would be vulnerable to the loss of grasslands. The entire ecosystem of the prairie flat lands acting as flood plains could collapse. Normal protocols for removing oil from water and land would be insufficient, as the spill would not be on the land or on the water but soaked into the topsoil, and subsoil. Using Lake Oahe dam would mean ecological ruin. It is nearly 150 miles away. It would mean a leak went undetected or unstopped for 25 hours. It would require complete failures of both human and automated systems. However, evidence is mounting that the leak detection devices do not work. A Nexin Energy pipeline burst in Alberta in July 2015, sending 1.3 million gallons. The pipeline was less than one year old. Leak alarms failed to alert the company of the spill. InsideClimateNews.org studied 10 years of pipeline spill information. The gross majority of spills are detected by people who happen to come across the spill, be them average citizens or oil workers. Nexin Energy could not even tell the public how long the Alberta pipeline was leaking because of the automated warning systems failure. The Center for Biological Diversity studied the numbers significant of pipeline incidents between 1986 and 2013. In 2013 North Dakota had one of the largest oil pipeline spills. A wheat field was deluged by 840,000 gallons of crude when lightening hit a pipe. Unlike in Alberta and Kalamazoo, the Missouri River is the primary water source for millions of people, including the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The reservation starts approximately just 2,400 feet from where the Bakken Dakota Access Pipeline is proposed to dip under the Missouri River. The time it would take to confirm a spill under the best conditions would probably be long enough for an oil spill to reach the reservation. Many states and area farms rely on the water from the Missouri to irrigate their farms. Should oil slip into the irrigation lines, the food supply could become interrupted for years as farms suffer from oil contamination. Lake Oahe offers reservation members and members of the public numerous recreational opportunities; including swimming, boating, camping, and wild life observation. Lake Oahe provides hydroelectric power for the surrounding area. Any interruptions in the creation or distribution of power because of a spill would diminish the welfare of the people who rely on it for power. Standing Rock Sioux preserved their right to the bottom of the Missouri River during the imminent domain acquisition outlined in Pick-Sloan. Winters Waters: In June 2016, the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, whose reservation is on the Missouri River south of Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, argued in a lawsuit that the federal government squandered their water rights to the Missouri River. The Supreme Court was asked to rule on the tribal sovereignty of water in a reservation in Winters v. United States. They ruled that because the goal of reservations was independent, self-sufficient native communities and water is essential to self-sufficiency, tribes must have secure, ample access to water. The ruling established reserved water rights. Reserved water rights apply to water and bodies of water in and directly around the reservations. Winters allocated each tribe enough water to sufficiently irrigate each irrigable acre on the reservation. Impact: Energy Transfer Company, the company which owns the Dakota Access Pipeline, prepared an environmental impact assessment for the Army Corps of Engineers. However, the environmental impact assessment failed to address the requirements of Pick-Sloan or the Winters ruling. Environmental impact assessments are required to explain the impact of a project on humans, flora, fauna, and the land. The Missouri River is the primary water source for the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Any contamination would shut down the majority of their guaranteed Winters water. No alternatives for the acquisition of Winters water in the event of a spill or contamination incident has been provided by Energy Transfer Company or The Army Corps of Engineers. The Supreme Court guarantee of sufficient irrigable water for the reservation is a human impact requirement which is not addressed in the environmental impact assessment prepared by Energy Transfer Company. Given the geography, topography, and infrastructure, failing to address the eight federal agency requirements in Pick-Sloan means the Environmental Impact Assessment has failed to meet the flora, fauna, and human impact requirements of the an Environmental Impact Assessment. Should the Army Corps of Engineers fail to require a full environmental impact statement, they are permitting their known legal duties to go unaddressed. The Army Corps of Engineers is now faced with the full weight of their legal charge for the health and care of the river. They must decide if issuing a permit to drill under the Missouri River will be a direct violation of the statutory requirements for protecting the river and of the Winter water requirements. The Water Protectors are waiting to learn if the Army Corps of Engineers will honor their legal duties under Pick-Sloan and pipe the snake way, or if it will charm it under the water.

Projects: Worldchanging; Carbon Zero; Heroic Future; The Nearly Now. American journalists, pundits and media executives have largely convinced themselves that climate change is not a serious political issue, because they think the polls tell them that. Trump has surrounded himself with more oil industry and oil industry connected people than any president in history (even George W. Bush). Climate change threatens to undermine civilization itself (Credit:Pixabay) Again, the American media has failed to convey the magnitude of the costs of unchecked global warming. Those costs are profound already, today, as the Arctic heatwave, Syrian civil war, bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, worsening storms, droughts, wildfires and freak weather events all show. Those costs will only grow, and they will grow more dire, more quickly as the planet heats. At the same time, the innovations we need to create zero-carbon prosperity are already here. From plummeting costs for solar, wind, electric vehicles and green buildings to better approaches to urban planning, agriculture and forestry, we already have the tools we need to start building a much more prosperous world, producing hosts of new companies and millions of jobs. Indeed, a giant building boom is what successful climate action looks like. But some people totally understand: the ones who stand to lose money from these changes. Even if we act decisively now, we will be wrestling with the impacts of that pollution for centuries. So one half of our task is to become zero-carbon societies, but the other is to ruggedize in the face of worsening problems, in many cases by abandoning places that cannot be saved and practices that cannot be continued. Climate action will trigger an enormous shift in the way we value things. Currently, though, these assets are valued very highly. Oil is seen as hugely valuable, coastal real estate is seen as hugely valuable, industrial patents are seen as hugely valuable. It is still growing. People whose job it is to measure risk in financial markets are extremely concerned about the magnitude of the Carbon Bubble and the damage it will do as it bursts. Because when it bursts, trillions of dollars of imaginary assets will simply vanish in a very short time. Mark Carney thinks the Carbon Bubble is extremely dangerous. Scores of experts warn that the Carbon Bubble is one of the biggest threats to the global economy. The way to increase the resilience of global markets, they say, is to act on climate, but to do so with bold-yet-predictable pacing. Climate action will stave off financial disaster as well ecological catastrophe. This is a win-win for everyone, except those heavily invested in those Carbon Bubble assets now. For these investors, the Carbon Bubble is a good thing: the longer it lasts, the more they reap the benefit of high valuations and large dividends. For them, the larger the Carbon Bubble swells, the more money they make. The Perception War There is no long game in high-carbon industries. Their owners know this. All they need is the perception of the inevitability of future profit, today. The value of oil companies will collapse long before the last barrel of oil is burned; the value of beachfront hotels will collapse long before rising tides flood their lobbies. Put another way: The pop comes when people understand that growth in these industries is over and that, in fact, these industries are now going to contract. As investors begin to flee these companies, others realize more devaluation is on the way, so they want to get out before the drop: a trickle of divestment becomes a flood and the price collapses. What triggers the drop is investors ceasing to believe the company has a strong future. Because that risk already exists, the pop is way closer than most people understand. You would ally with extremists and other sources of anti-democratic power, in order to be able to fight democratic efforts to cut emissions through the application of threats, instability and violence. For oil and gas companies, this means new exploration and new pipelines. Two reasons: First, it sends a signal of confidence to markets that you expect to continue to grow in the future. This, too, bolsters investor confidence. (Note that whether these assets are eventually abandoned or not is of little concern to current investors looking to delay devaluations). Rex Tillerson and Vladimir Putin (Wikimedia Commons) Trump wants ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be his Secretary of State. You might remember that Exxon has been a main driver of climate denialism, as well as being one the largest polluters in history. Tillerson also has close ties with Vladimir Putin. Think that one over. Trump has also put forward a host of other appointees who are overt climate denialists and generally also have financial ties to industries threatened by the Carbon Bubble. If you were going to ask why a country like Russia would risk a war to interfere with American politics, look at what the Russian economy is. Those oil and gas assets are controlled by a small number of oligarchs gathered around Putin, the former head of the KGB. Those oligarchs may be the one group of investors who stands to lose the most from the popping of the Carbon Bubble. Now, add in all the other Bubble-expanding projects and ploys, pipelines and hotels, and you begin to see the magnitude of the scam here. The difference between the Carbon Bubble deflating rapidly now and popping spectacularly in a decade or more could mean literally trillions more dollars in profits for the kind of people now helicoptering into Washington. But that same delay would also bring on climate catastrophe, damage our democracy and bring financial ruin for the investors who are left holding those assets when the bubble pops. It is not hyperbole to say that swelling the Carbon Bubble is not only not in the interests of the United States, it increases threats to our economy and national security, puts Americans at risk, undermines our prosperity and weakens our nation. It sounds like a conspiracy theory, frankly, because we are so cognitively unprepared to see the Bubble in front of us. That we are so blind to these risks is a tragedy.

Scores of experts warn that the Carbon Bubble is one of the biggest threats to the global economy. The way to increase the resilience of global markets, they say, is to act on climate, but to do so with bold-yet-predictable pacing. For these investors, the Carbon Bubble is a good thing: the longer it lasts, the more they reap the benefit of high valuations and large dividends. Their owners know this. All they need is the perception of the inevitability of future profit, today. another way: The pop comes when people understand that growth in these industries is over and that, in fact, these industries are now going to contract. As investors begin to flee these companies, others realize more devaluation is on the way, so they want to get out before the drop: a trickle of divestment becomes a flood and the price collapses. For oil and gas companies, this means new exploration and new pipelines. Two reasons: First, it sends a signal of confidence to markets that you expect to continue to grow in the future. This, too, bolsters investor confidence. You might remember that Exxon has been a main driver of climate denialism, as well as being one the largest polluters in history. Think that one over. has also put forward a host of other appointees who are overt climate denialists and generally also have financial ties to industries threatened by the Carbon Bubble. Those oil and gas assets are controlled by a small number of oligarchs gathered around Putin, the former head of the KGB. add in all the other Bubble-expanding projects and ploys, pipelines and hotels, and you begin to see the magnitude of the scam here. that same delay would also bring on climate catastrophe, damage our democracy and bring financial ruin for the investors who are left holding those assets when the bubble pops. It sounds like a conspiracy theory, frankly, because we are so cognitively unprepared to see the Bubble in front of us. Insights into crisis. Explorations of possibility.

In any other administration, that level of dispute might have made the front page. This is a lost opportunity for anyone who cares about environmental protection at the national level. The nomination of Betsy DeVos, a Republican donor who appeared not to know about basic federal education law, led to constituents clogging Senate switchboards. But the EPA wields much more power over air and water pollution than the Department of Education does over schools. And unlike DeVos, Pruitt is a tireless and knowledgable advocate for his cause of cutting environmental protections. He knows the statutes that govern the EPA, and (like the Obama administration) he knows how to interpret them to bring about his policy ends. By itself, this letter may not have been so odd: Republicans in oil-rich states often see an easy enemy in the EPA. Instead, it had been written by lobbyists working for Devon Energy, an Oklahoma City-based oil-and-gas firm. Pruitt received the letter in an email from Devon, changed two sentences and a couple spare words, and apparently forwarded it to the administrator of the EPA with his own name at the bottom. Devon Energy later donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Republican Attorneys General Association, while Pruitt was its chairman. This week, it finally received a reply to its first request, filed more than two years ago: a set of 411 emails exchanged between Pruitt and local oil companies. Most of the records they received were mass newsletters and not the one-on-one correspondence they believe exists. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday. Many government officials run sluggish public-records departments. He just chose not to. Secrecy is not the only knock against Pruitt. As attorney general of Oklahoma, he sued the EPA at least 14 times. He tried to block mercury and ozone protections that he thought were too onerous. He sued on behalf of an oil company to prevent enforcement of the Endangered Species Act. Burford left the agency after three years, unpopular and disliked, having accidentally won more power for the agency in the Supreme Court. They cite the burning Cuyahoga River, smog-choked Los Angeles, and the thousands of early deaths through asthma and heart failure. The United States adopted strict environmental laws (and under a Republican president, no less) because of the horrors of that period. But we are entering a similarly consequential time for environmental regulation. The price of renewable energy may soon finally become competitive with coal. Solar and wind will lead to major-emission reductions from the power sector: a key step in the fight to mitigate climate change. Whether wind and solar are allowed to change the U.S. energy market will depend on federal leadership across agencies. We want to hear what you think about this article.

Members of the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes, as well as environmentalists from around the country, have fought the pipeline project on the grounds that it crosses beneath a lake that provides drinking water to native Americans. They say the route beneath Lake Oahe puts the water source in jeopardy and would destroy sacred land. North Dakota officials estimate more than 176,000 gallons of crude oil leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline into the Ash Coulee Creek. State environmental scientist Bill Suess says a landowner discovered the spill on Dec. 5 near the city of Belfield, which is roughly 150 miles from the epicenter of the Dakota Access pipeline protest camps. The leak was contained within hours of the its discovery, Wendy Owen, a spokeswoman for Casper, Wyoming-based True Cos., which operates the Belle Fourche pipeline, told CNBC. It's not yet clear why electronic monitoring equipment didn't detect the leak, Owen told the Asssociated Press. Owen said the pipeline was shut down immediately after the leak was discovered. United States Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy said the best path forward was to explore alternative routes for the pipeline, something Energy Transfer Partners says it will not do. Energy Transfer Partners says the Dakota Access pipeline would include safeguards such as leak detection equipment and that workers monitoring the pipeline remotely in Texas could close valves within three minutes if a breach is detected. Republican President-elect Donald Trump has voiced support for the Dakota Access Pipeline. About 5,000 people are still occupying land near the planned construction site. The 6-inch steel Belle Fourche pipeline is mostly underground but was built above ground where it crosses Ash Coulee Creek, Suess said. Owen said the pipeline was built in the 1980s and is used to gather oil from nearby oil wells to a collection point. Suess said the spill migrated almost 6 miles from the spill site along Ash Coulee Creek, and it fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. The creek feeds into the Little Missouri River, but Seuss said it appears no oil got that far and that no drinking water sources were threatened. The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over. About 60 workers were on site Monday, and crews have been averaging about 100 yards daily in their cleanup efforts, he said. Some of the oil remains trapped beneath the frozen creek. Suess says about 37,000 gallons of oil have been recovered. The 32,000-gallon spill temporarily shut down water supplies in the downstream community of Glendive, Montana, after oil was detected in the city's water treatment system. True Cos. operates at least three pipeline companies with a combined 1,648 miles of line in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming, according to information the companies submitted to federal regulators.

On paper, the TransCanada Corporation now has the Trump administration's blessings to add hundreds of miles of pipeline to allow hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude produced by the Alberta tar sands to flow daily into the U.S., a permission twice denied by President Barack Obama two years ago (by veto and by outright denial of its permit), but it's premature to assume the project will actually get built. The international market for oil isn't what it once was. Prices have fallen, and that's a particularly big issue for oil extracted from tar sands which is more expensive (not to mention environmentally damaging) to produce. And the State Department permit is not the only snag. There are lawsuits by property owners in Nebraska which also must issue a permit and where concerns have been expressed about protecting underground water reserves. There are likely to be further protests mounted by Native Americans and environmentalists in South Dakota, Montana and Nebraska as there have been around the Dakota Access Pipeline. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau may have supported the project in the past, but he also must be mindful of his country's overall greenhouse gas emissions and meeting nationwide limits Canada promised in the Paris climate agreement. The Canadian government has already approved other pipeline projects that are essentially using up its cap space, including an expansion of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline that runs to the country's west coast. That raises the distinct possibility that by focusing on backward-looking energy polices (his promise to revive the U.S. coal industry providing the other glaring example), Mr. Trump isn't boosting jobs, he's costing the U.S. important economic opportunities. The more we encourage and accommodate needless greenhouse gas emissions by other nations, the quicker the bill for those decisions is coming due. So much of the Keystone XL project's merits have been overstated. While there may be thousands of construction jobs created on a temporary basis, a 2015 analysis concluded that Keystone will produce just 50 permanent jobs in the U.S. If Keystone merely enables TransCanada to sell its oil on the international market somewhat faster than before, the only tangible effect will be to compound the effects of climate change as the oil is consumed. And even if President Trump and others respond by doing no more than sticking their collective heads further in the sand, the costs associated with climate change from higher temperatures and sea level rise to stronger hurricanes and worsened droughts will dwarf any possible short term benefits of allowing oil and gas producers to run wild. We support job-producing infrastructure investment but not at so high a price. This is short-sighted, self-destructive behavior on the part of president who won't listen to reason or scientific evidence. The only good news is that perhaps Mr. Trump's stamp of approval comes too late to rescue a project that makes even less sense today than it did in 2008."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/265699559t?referring_akid=.2088839.ZjPPlg", "Timestamp": "20180919011256", "Sentences": "Credo Action Stop Trump from building the Dakota Access pipeline.

The controversial pipeline would carry fracked natural gas through 300 miles of West Virginia and Virginia. It has faced vocal opposition, motivating nine tree sitters to block its path since February. The landowners in Tuesday's suit, Wendell and Mary Flora, Glenn and Linda Firth, and Michael and France Hurt, live near a pipeline construction site in Franklin County, Virginia. Heavy rains May 15 caused a mudslide to override construction barriers at the pipeline work site on May 18 and block Cahas Mountain Road with 8 inches of mud.

A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies. Macrophages, which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body, protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles. The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants. That's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA's Office of Inspector General (OIG), the agency's internal watchdog. EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement, and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency.

The discovery of the pipeline spill in western North Dakota has drawn heightened attention because of the battle over the Dakota Access oil pipeline being built across the state. While the spill was on a different pipeline, the Standing Rock Sioux and its supporters say a spill on the Dakota Access pipeline could threaten the tribe's drinking water, which is drawn from the Missouri River. About 176,000 gallons of oil spilled, with about 130,000 gallons that flowed into Ash Coulee Creek. A photo released by the North Dakota Department of Health shows the brown muck on the creek's surface, and another photo shows what appears to be the pipeline break with oil oozing out. As of Wednesday, about 46,000 gallons had been recovered. Regulators don't expect the cleanup to be completed until spring. It appears no oil got into the Little Missouri River, and no drinking water sources were threatened, according to Bill Suess, an environmental scientist with the health department. The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over. The spill was in a remote area of the southwest part of the state, far from any major population centers. It fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. A landowner spotted the spill Dec. 5. Electronic monitoring equipment failed to detect the rupture, but it's not clear why, according to Wendy Owen, a spokeswoman for Casper, Wyoming-based True Cos., which operates the pipeline. The pipeline was shut down as soon as the leak was discovered. Owen said erosion of a hillside might have ruptured the pipe, but the cause is still being investigated. It's sizeable, but there have been much larger oil spills in North Dakota. In September 2013, a Tesoro Corp. pipeline break spilled more than 840,000 gallons of oil into a wheat field near Tioga. That spill is still being cleaned up. True Cos. has a history of spills in North Dakota and Montana, including a January 2015 pipeline break into the Yellowstone River. That 32,000-gallon spill temporarily shut down water supplies in the downstream community of Glendive, Montana, after oil was detected in the city's water treatment system. It's much smaller. The 6-inch steel Belle Fourche Pipeline, built in the 1980s, is mostly underground but crosses Ash Coulee Creek above ground. It's one of a network of thousands of miles of similar pipelines that crisscross western North Dakota's oil patch to pick up oil from wells and carry it to collection points, where it ultimately moves into larger pipelines or railroad tankers destined for refineries across the U.S. The Dakota Access pipeline is a 30-inch steel pipeline that will carry nearly 20 million gallons of North Dakota oil daily through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. It is largely complete except for a segment, blocked by the federal government, that's near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, where it would be buried 90 to 115 feet below Lake Oahe. Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners says the line will have modern leak detection equipment, and that workers monitoring the pipeline remotely could close valves within three minutes if a breach was detected. The Standing Rock tribe argues that putting the pipeline under the lake imperils drinking water for more than 8,000 tribal members and millions downstream. ETP and other pipeline advocates maintain that transporting oil through pipelines is safer than shipping it by truck or train. appears no oil got into the Little Missouri River, and no drinking water sources were threatened, according to Bill Suess, an environmental scientist with the health department. spill was in a remote area of the southwest part of the state, far from any major population centers. pipeline was shut down as soon as the leak was discovered.

CBS News collected reported incidents for 2010 at wells and pipelines from three federal agencies and 23 of 33 oil and gas producing states. Not counting the BP disaster, we found at least 6,500 spills, leaks, fires or explosions nationwide - that's 18 a day.

Bitumen is a viscous substance found in small concentrations amid the rock and soil. It is either mined out from huge open pits, or pumped out through in situ production, injecting hot water deep into the ground to loosen it. Either way, the resulting product is highly polluting, very expensive to produce and of low value. Bitumen is a solid. To be refined, bitumen must undergo costly upgrading. Before the 2008 global financial crisis, there were upgraders and refineries being planned. But when the recession hit, those investments, along with any new oil sands mines, retreated. When the economy recovered, oil sands expansion came back. But not the upgraders and refineries. Instead, for the first time, industry began to promote pipelines. Keystone was the first pipeline proposed to run north-south to take Canadian bitumen to other countries for processing. Since bitumen is a solid, there is nothing logical about proposing to move it through a pipeline. Stirring in fossil fuel condensate (essentially naptha) creates a mixture sufficiently liquid to flow through a pipeline, without the expense of upgrading it to synthetic crude. The resulting mix of condensate (called diluent) and bitumen is called dilbit. And it is very challenging to clean up. The 2010 dilbit spill in Kalamazoo, Michigan was the first time regulators realized dilbit behaved very differently than conventional crude. The diluent is highly toxic and volatile. Diluent separated from bitumen and bitumen sank to the river bottom. By the 2011 election, pipelines had become a political issue. Former prime minister, Conservative Stephen Harper, an Albertan who stood four-square for fossil fuel development, opposed any pipelines heading to the British Columbia coastline. Justin Trudeau announced support for the Kinder Morgan pipeline. In doing so, he violated election promises to respect indigenous rights Within months of that election, difficulties in gaining US permits for Keystone led to an entirely new position. In 2013, Texas-based Kinder Morgan asked to build a second pipeline more or less along the lines of the Transmountain pipeline purchased from a Canadian company from Alberta to Burnaby, not far from Vancouver BC. It would increase tanker traffic, loaded with dilbit, seven-fold. To grease the gears for pipeline approval, Harper gutted environmental laws. The resulting environmental review of the Kinder Morgan expansion was the worst in Canadian history. No longer reviewed by our environmental assessment agency, the pipeline was before the National Energy Board. Intervenor rights, such as cross examination of industry witnesses, were eliminated. In the 2015 election campaign, Justin Trudeau pledged that no project could be approved based on such an inadequate process. Trudeau promised evidence-based decisions, respect for indigenous rights, the end to fossil fuel subsidies and an aggressive climate plan. In 2016, the Liberals turned down the Enbridge pipeline due to the court ruling the previous government violated indigenous rights. Simultaneously, Trudeau announced support for the Kinder Morgan pipeline. In doing so, he violated election promises to respect indigenous rights, to base decisions on evidence, and to pursue real climate action. Having approved Kinder Morgan, he and his ministers became increasingly pro-pipeline. Meanwhile fifteen different court cases were working through the federal court of appeal. The new BC government raised its concerns about the threat of a dilbit spill and to survival of the endangered southern resident killer whales. In March, I was one of the several hundred people arrested protesting against the Kinder Morgan pipeline. As opposition built in British Columbia, Trudeau insisted the pipeline was in the national interest and must be built. On 8 April, Kinder Morgan upped the ante and demanded the federal government remove the uncertainty created by all the court challenges to the project by 31 May. Astonishingly, the government announced on 29 May that the government of Canada will buy the existing Transmountain pipeline. As well, the Trudeau administration says it will get the controversial expansion pipeline built. We await the court decisions. This battle is a long way from over.

A spokesman for New York State Common Retirement Fund declined to comment beyond the resolution itself. Energy Transfer Partners LP owns the project jointly with Phillips 66 and Sunoco Logistics Partners LP. Marathon and Enbridge Energy Partners LP announced a joint venture in August that would also take a minority stake in the pipeline. Spokesmen at Marathon and Enbridge declined to comment. Jeff Shields, a spokesman for Sunoco Logistics, said the company has not received any shareholder resolutions on the pipeline. An Energy Transfer spokeswoman declined to comment and referred Bloomberg Briefs to a Sept. 13 memorandum about the pipeline by chairman and chief executive officer Kelcy Warren. Other investors are also pushing the issue. Boston Common Asset Management, for example, said last month on its website that it is helping to craft shareholder proposals for Marathon, Phillips 66 and Enbridge that it expects will be filed in coming weeks. The fund is focusing on these companies because the other major partners in the pipeline are limited partnerships and therefore can't receive proxy proposals from shareholders, Boston Common said. The uproar over the pipeline is part of a broader environmental and social debate over whether there is a need for more fossil fuel conduits across the U.S. and whether these projects trample over the rights of indigenous people. While some investors are raising their concerns with the energy companies themselves, other shareholder groups are going directly to the lenders funding the disputed pipeline. The group has also co-filed proposals at Marathon and is planning another at Phillips 66, Fugere said. Rebecca Adamson, founder and president of First Peoples Worldwide, which advocates for funding local development projects in indigenous communities, estimates that at least eight shareholder resolutions have been filed with energy companies and banks involved in the pipeline. The largest lenders involved in the pipeline include Citigroup Global Markets Inc., TD Securities USA LLC, Mizuho Bank Ltd., and Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., according to Bloomberg data. TD said it has retained law firm Foley Hoag LLP, an independent human rights expert, on behalf of the lenders to conduct a review and make recommendations to improvements to Energy Transfer's and Sunoco Logistics' social policies and procedures. Foley Hoag confirmed that it would be working on the review. Representatives at Wells Fargo and Mizuho did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Mitsubishi declined to comment. Some lenders are even taking the matter into their own hands. Norwegian bank DNB said last month that it was conducting an evaluation of how indigenous people's rights were being treated during the resolution of the conflict. The backlash over the Dakota Access crude pipeline may discourage companies from pursuing the construction of similar projects in the future without considering the impacts, said First Peoples Worldwide's Adamson.

Consumer, service and transportation businesses had more specific and detailed sustainability disclosures on material issues important to investors than companies whose models focus more on business-to-business sales, a study of 713 U.S. securities filings by the San Francisco-based Sustainability Accounting Standards Board found. Still, customers and investors don't have exactly the same needs, Guillot said. Customers may care about a company's exposure to forced labor or a chemical in its products, while investors may care about sustainability metrics that could drive profits and help them compare a company's performance to peers, she said. SASB is a non-profit that is working to set industry standards for companies to disclose material sustainability information in Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Boilerplate was found in 43 percent of all sustainability exposures analyzed, but was less common in European filers where there is more regulation on sustainability disclosure, SASB found. The fund says its ambition is to develop a portfolio in line with the 2-degree target that will be achieved by integrating climate analysis into investment process. AP2 has previously divested from companies dedicated exclusively to coal extraction and in oil and gas companies with major investments in new high-cost projects. In total, AP2 has divested from 76 companies due to financial climate risks. Analysis: Low-Carbon Index Performance May Worsen Source: Bloomberg Intelligence. Indexes that exclude fossil-fuel extraction companies or companies with high carbon emissions have generally underperformed their benchmarks by about half a percentage point this year, as oil and gas company shares rallied. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to exit the Paris climate accord and roll back regulations may support high-carbon company prospects and dim those for low-carbon solution providers. Declining renewables and low-carbon technology costs may provide longer-term low-carbon support. The index will contain both investment grade and non-investment grade bonds. The fund, which is set to list on the NYSE Arca, would be the first green bond ETF out of 1,900 ETFs currently trading and 1,200 in registration, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

The five year security paying a 2 percent coupon attracted investors from Europe, the Americas and Asia, according to a bank statement. Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led the sale. Here are some of the year's more unique structures, according to Ridley. Moody's rated the bond Aa3. While it is not technically a green bond because the proceeds are not used to fund a green project, bondholders have the option to receive their interest payments in the form of cash or voluntary carbon units. The carbon units will come from a reforestation project in east Kenya, IFC said. SNCF's Novel Transport Green Bond SNCF is using proceeds from green bonds to both refinance and fund the French rail system. The remaining portion of the bond proceeds will be used for building new infrastructure, the report said. Using a green bond to refinance an existing bond has a few benefits, HSBC's Ridley said. It could also be a benefit to the original bank lender. In the U.S., 9.7 percent of fund managers were women at the end of 2015, down from 11.4 percent prior to the financial crisis.

More than 14 percent of U.S. consumers looked for apparel and accessories made from natural materials in 2016, up from 12.9 percent last year, according to a Euromonitor International survey. Shoppers looking for clothes that were reused or recycled rose 2 percent this year. This shift to so-called sustainable clothing is threatening the underpinnings of a fashion industry that wants consumers to rapidly change styles and move on to the next hot trends. The challenge may come earlier than big retail chains expect. Consumers are more willing to shop at niche, smaller companies this season, according to Deloitte LLP. But fast-fashion companies are trying to respond. In 2013, H&M launched a worldwide garment-collecting initiative encouraging consumers to reuse and recycle their clothes. Zara launched its first sustainable line, Join Life, in September. And the very nature of high-turnover fast-fashion companies strikes many as unsustainable, she said. She said the biggest challenge for retailers will be to make sustainable products affordable and accessible to millennials. Lowering prices for sustainable collections would help these businesses stay relevant, as most consumers shop at H&M and Zara because of the cheap price tags. Still, some in the industry are pushing the notion that millennials will save money by spending a bit more on longer-lasting items. Kim founded Los Angeles-based Dosa after moving from Seoul. Her idea started in West Bengal, where she began collecting old saris to incorporate into new designs. Kim tracked her expenses in both regular and recycled production. With traditional clothing production, 40 percent of her expenses went to materials, 53 percent to labor, and 7 percent to shipping and other duties. With a recycled production, Kim spent 14 percent on materials, 81 percent on labor, and 5 percent on shipping and duties.

Sounds crazy, but the damage makes perfect business sense under the no pain, no gain policy driving the electric-vehicle boom in the U.S. California crafted the doctrine, with tough clean-air rules and a mandate that automakers sell some non-polluting vehicles if they want to do business in the Golden State. Nine others have adopted it, New York and New Jersey among them, and all told they make up close to 30 percent of the U.S. market. That goes a long way to explaining why zero-emissions models from more than 10 brands are on the roads, with more on the way. The hurdles may go higher: Brown, a Democrat with two years left in his term, signed a law ordering greenhouse-gas emissions be 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.

As content of dubious authenticity swirls on platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google, many in the media worry consumers may lose trust in stories that are actually true. Maybe most uncomfortable are the social media companies, Facebook especially. They make millions in ad revenue by distributing information, but the last thing they want are the responsibilities that come with being a publisher, like ensuring stories are accurate. Shares of the social media and internet companies have underperformed the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index since the US election on Nov. 8. All exporters of gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten to the EU have to trace the origin of the four minerals. Importers must do due diligence checks.

The announcement by the Rye, N.Y.-based asset manager ends the first attempt by any investor to utilize proxy access for gaining a board seat. The mechanism allows shareholders to nominate their own board candidates. Last month Gamco, which owns a 7.8 percent stake in NFG, nominated former Goldman Sachs partner Lance Bakrow as a proxy access candidate to the Williamsville, N.Y.-based natural gas company's nine-member board. Bakrow decided to withdraw his nomination, Gamco said in a Nov. 28 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ComScore, whose shares are down 30 percent this year, said last week that it would need to make accounting adjustments for some monetary transactions reviewed in the probe. The company also named a new chairman at the conclusion of a nine-month investigation that found the company lacked appropriate internal accounting controls. The biggest opportunities for impact investing are in emerging markets, especially in infrastructure, he said. Interviewed by Siobhan Wagner, Bloomberg Briefs, on Oct. 25. Comments have been edited and condensed for clarity. Q: Just to start off, I understand that you feel some impact investors are too picky, they apply too many investment screens, and this is causing a lack of deal flow. A: We always screen for those three things. It's more that we may say, for example, we want to do an infrastructure or financial inclusion deal, but we also want to be in a post-conflict country like Sierra Leone or Liberia. When we consider the investment opportunities in a country like that, we may find a transaction in a different sector, so not infrastructure or financial inclusion. It could be in agriculture or services. And because we want to be in that market, we will look at any sector. If impact investors want to scale up and invest a lot more, we really think emerging markets is where they can do it. If they invested even 1 percent of their portfolios in emerging market infrastructure, that would be enough to fill the financing gap. A: In a world where yields on sovereign debt, and things that are the big part of their portfolios, are close to zero, this is an attractive opportunity for them to get extra yield. A: What we're working on is various vehicles that allow institutional investors to invest in a big-ticket-size portfolio, rather than individual projects. We have a couple of models. One is through our asset management company. For example, we offer infrastructure funds, where if you want to invest equity in infrastructure, you can invest in an IFC-managed fund, and that fund invests in infrastructure projects. The second model we have on the debt side is a managed co-lending portfolio program. An insurance company has already made a commitment and we expect other investors to join the program. The idea there is they can invest in a larger ticket size: half a billion dollars or a billion dollars. We then take that money and invest it alongside IFC's own lending, project by project. A: I think it varies. There are fully commercial investors like pension funds and insurance companies, which are really just interested in the financial return. Then you have other investors, some high net worth investors, who are looking at both a financial and impact story. We think that infrastructure does offer a good impact story. Secondly, a lot of infrastructure investments have positive climate change benefits. A big part of our infrastructure program at the moment is in clean energy and retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency.

But despite relative ambivalence toward it by the Obama administration, research has continued apace. At the head of the pack are venture capitalists like Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who is said to be working on Trump's transition team. He's funded a fusion start-up called Helion Energy to pursue the ultimate dream of environmentalists. More than 100 plants have been canceled over the years. Fusion, meanwhile, would eliminate planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions if scientists could only harness its power. But that tantalizing promise of a grand solution has kept investors investing.

In its view, B.C. is violating Canadian law in obstructing a federally approved plan. Details on its perspective, and calls to action for Albertans, are on its Keep Canada Working web page. The pipeline itself is a big piece but only one piece of the puzzle here. Pipelines might be safer and more efficient than other overland transportation options. That does not mean that an expanded pipeline running through an active earthquake zone would not leak. In fact, from its beginnings in 1961 to early 2017, the existing Trans Mountain pipeline had 56 reportable spills, at least 21 of which exceeded 100 barrels. The heightened risks accompanying an expanded pipeline would not end at the pipeline terminus. Beyond the pipeline are the ships that would transport diluted bitumen from Burnaby to be refined elsewhere before becoming available to consumers. Expanding the Trans Mountain pipeline would mean increasing the number and size of ships entering and moving across B.C. coastal waters. Those factors make transit tricky, potential damage extensive and unpredictable, and a post-spill cleanup of bitumen all but impossible. Those jobs are based in the energy sector across Canada, with only a portion of them in Alberta. These sectors are especially vulnerable to damage caused by leaks or spills. That explains why First Nations and other communities alongside river and ocean waters are so opposed to this project. In B.C., fishing involves more than commercial fisheries. It is connected as well to tourism, recreation and Indigenous cultures. Good jobs are important for all people, working in all places and sectors. Furthermore, not all people are workers. People are more than their jobs, and there is more at stake here than jobs. Even if First Nations whose territories would be crossed by the expanded pipeline have signed onto the project, that does not mean that other Nations do not have a legitimate say in decision-making. Indigenous opposition to this proposal involves leaders of several First Nations whose territories, cultural practices and well-being are threatened by this project. Granted, a number of First Nations support the project, but leaders of other Nations that would face particularly high risks have laid out their case against it. Their response involves both government-to-government action and social activism. In my scholarship on critical consumption that recognizes the costs and dangers of unbridled consumerism, I recognize social movements as sources of important learning for citizens, whether activists or spectators. As another Indigenous scholar, Roxanne Ornelas, points out, Canada was a late signatory to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Harms reconciliation efforts Premier Notley can downplay or disregard social activism but, in identifying the governments involved in this issue, any analysis needs to include First Nations governments. Overlooking their role flies in the face of reconciliation between Indigenous and settler peoples, supposedly a top priority for all levels of government and all Canadians. The Alberta government has gone so far as to intervene in opposition to the court case launched by seven First Nations, as well as environmental organizations and some B.C. municipalities. In her statements, Notley routinely ignores the fact that she is opposing those First Nations governments. This article was originally published at The Conversation.

The company switched hands several times over the years before closing in 1993 after several releases of hazardous chemicals. In January 1986, one worker was killed and dozens more were injured after a cylinder of uranium hexafluoride ruptured.

Their primary fear is that an oil leak would threaten water quality for many members of the tribal community. But shortly after, federal officials said they would temporarily stop construction pending further review. But despite the national attention to this case, one point has gone largely ignored in my view: Stopping DAPL is a matter of climate justice and decolonization for indigenous peoples. It may not always be apparent to people outside these communities, but standing up for water quality and heritage are intrinsically tied to these larger issues. Climate scientists, through organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and U.S. Climate Assessment, are finding more evidence of climate change from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These destabilize the climate system, producing environmental conditions that disrupt human societies, through impacts such as rising sea levels, more severe droughts and warming freshwater. The same climate science organizations also show that indigenous peoples are among the populations who will suffer more, on average, than other communities from changing environmental conditions. Some are suffering right now. One of the encampments that has formed along the banks of the Cannon Ball River in North Dakota over the past few months to protest construction of the North Dakota Access Pipeline which would transport oil under the Missouri River above the water access point for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. This is happening in other parts of the world too. DAPL, a 1,172-mile connector of the Bakken and Three Forks fossil fuel basins to major oil refining markets, maintains the carbon energy foundation Wildcat writes of. The protectors, meanwhile, are bringing public attention to the urgency of reducing a fossil fuel dependence. Because indigenous peoples suffer the effects of climate change disproportionately, continuing fossil fuel dependence will inflict more harms in years to come. But there is more to this story, as climate change and U.S. colonialism against indigenous peoples are closely related. It also sheds important light on indigenous understanding of what climate justice really means and what solutions are required. History of exploitation Put simply, colonialism refers to a form of domination that involves at least one society seeking to exploit some set of benefits they believe to be found in the territories of one or more other indigenous societies already living there. These benefits can range from farm land and precious minerals to labor. Exploitation can occur through tactics including military invasion, coercion, slavery, policing and geographic removal of indigenous peoples. Sexual and gender violence are integral to undermining indigenous leadership customs, many of which were tied to nonpatriarchal gender systems that empowered women and nonbinary genders. U.S. colonialism is about continued U.S. control over how indigenous peoples govern themselves internally and their territories as Tribal Nations. The U.S. Congress officially has plenary (absolute) power over tribes. The U.S. considers indigenous jurisdictions, including reservations, as U.S. federal land held in trust for tribes. The view of the North Dakota Access Pipeline running between farms about a one-and-a-half hour drive from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Indeed, the U.S. has not fulfilled all of its treaty responsibilities to tribes, especially when treaty obligations interfere with the economic interests of settlers. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe at the center of this current protest has already suffered from this practice. Until U.S. mining interests were at stake, it retained sovereignty over the sacred Black Hills and parts of the Missouri River and certain off reservation hunting rights in the Treaty of Ft. Laramie of 1868. U.S. colonialism, then, serves to pave the way for the expansion of extractive industries which scientists have now identified as contributors to human-caused climate change. Damming and deforestation of indigenous territories enable mining and industrial agriculture; pipelines, roads and refineries create dependence on fossil fuels for energy. Colonial exploitation of indigenous lands through these industries has already inflicted immediate harms on indigenous peoples, from water and air pollution to destruction of sacred sites. Many of these environmental harms can be compared to climate change, as land-use change alters land temperatures, soil composition and hydrology. Herein lies a pattern of harms arising from colonialism. Vicious pattern But not all of the impacts of carbon-intensive industries are felt immediately. Climate change impacts occur in greater force some years later, as the effects of changing environmental conditions are felt more and more, all of which is made worse by U.S. colonialism. When it comes to indigenous climate refugees, any decision to relocate is made particularly difficult by U.S. domination over decision-making and discriminatory bureaucratic hurdles. Moreover, climate change also opens up more indigenous territories, such as in the Arctic, to pressure from colonial exploitation, as thawing snow and ice open access to resources, such as oil and other hydrocarbons, that were previously hard to get to. Of course, some of the sites of violence are the very same North Dakota fracking fields that seek to send fuel down the DAPL. Stopping DAPL, then, is about stopping a vicious pattern of U.S. colonialism that inflicts immediate environmental harms and future climate change impacts on indigenous peoples. For indigenous peoples, then, decolonization is not a metaphor. The Lummi is part of a group of tribes that have documented the U.S. negligence in honoring its treaty responsibility to refrain from economic and consumptive activities that destroy the salmon habitat that the Lummi and other tribes in the region depend on. A protest in Washington, D.C. on Sept. 13 against completion of the pipeline. Similarly, for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, shifting plant and animal habitats from climate change combined with loss of jurisdiction over land, both due to U.S. colonialism, will make it harder for tribal members to maintain relationships with those plants and animals into the future. So as the protests and legal battles over the construction of the pipeline continue, we need to realize that protection of sacred sites and worries over contaminated water supplies are simultaneously concerns about climate justice and its relation to U.S. colonialism. Nonindigenous environmentalists are only allies if they work broadly toward decolonization, instead of aligning with indigenous peoples only when a particular issue, such as opposition to one pipeline, seems to match their interests.

Photo courtesy of Lorraine Caron Previous story Pipeline incidents like oil spills are on the rise across Canada, and an aging Montreal-Ontario line that has been plagued with safety problems and leaks is a major reason why, says a new report released Thursday. Most of those, 86 per cent, were on oil pipelines, as opposed to gas. The Ontario-Quebec pipeline run by Trans-Northern Pipelines runs from Montreal to southern Ontario and connects with airports in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto. There were 23 spills of either refined petroleum products or crude oil in Quebec from 2004 to 2017, the report stated. Incidents also increased in other provinces: In Ontario, there were more incidents in both 2016 and 2017 than in any other year since 2008. As well, in British Columbia there were more in 2017 than any year over the last decade. Alberta also saw more incidents last year than any year since 2012. Trans-Northern flows east to west, pushing roughly 172,900 barrels a day of refined fuel products from Montreal to southern Ontario. It has been the subject of protests that have temporarily shut it down. Despite several NEB safety orders, incidents have increased on the pipeline, and it remains open. There were 23 spills in total. It said technology used by industry only detected 39 per cent of spills and incidents. National Observer asked the NEB about the rise in incidents over the decade, the spike of incidents for Trans-Northern, the incident reporting lag and technology used by industry. The NEB has also moved to implement a new reporting system since 2015 alongside the federal transport regulator. That system has reduced the number of discrepancies between multiple databases, he said. Investigative journalism has never been more important. Subscribe Share this article.

Even a minor spill could contaminate the water supply of the most densely populated area of the country. Water contamination is not the only hazard posed by this project. There is also the issue of oversight. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration employs just 208 inspectors, who together with 345 state inspectors are charged with overseeing more than 2.7 million miles of pipeline. The Pilgrim Pipeline will pass through 30 New Jersey towns and 25 New York municipalities will be overseen by one inspector every 20.000 miles. Despite concerns raised by environmentalists, Pilgrim Pipeline Holdings offers a different version of the facts. Seemingly oblivious of pipeline-related disasters like the 2013 Pegasus spill in Alabama or 2010 Enbridge spill in Michigan, the company describes its planned infrastructure buildup as a boon for East Coast communities along its path. The State of New York thinks otherwise. As the company proceeds through the permitting process, Pilgrim Pipeline Holdings will have to respond to these potential threats. From 1967 to 1971, Ford Motor Company dumped industrial waste in the woods of Upper Ringwood, where many Ramapough families live. The site was declared safe by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1994 only to be re-listed as a Superfund site in 2006. Local residents have experienced above-average rates of lung and cervical cancer, as well as asthma, miscarriages and skin conditions, which they attribute to the pollution. Currently, New York University is researching the lasting health impacts of the waste dump with the help of members of the Ramapough Nation. At the Sept. 23 event, Science for the People, which takes its name from a now-defunct publication where Stephen Jay Gould and other notable scientists cut their political teeth throughout the 70s, promoted the idea that scientists can be an allies to and advocates for human rights movements. An early issue of Science for the People. The march is part of a budding resurgence in environmental activism brought on by recent hurricanes that have highlighted the threat posed by climate change.

It was at this time that the economy collapsed due to its singular reliance on one input source. Thus, many private and state actors are proposing new and expanded hydrocarbon pipeline networks to reduce reliance on single-large networks emanating from or traveling through volatile regions.

But according to an updated estimate, the amount of oil that leaked from Bell Fourche was significantly higher, making it one of the largest pipeline spills in the state's history. That's three times as much oil than was initially estimated, and that doesn't even include the hillside area of the spill, which Belle Fourche estimates could contain up to 20 percent of the spill's total volume. Fracking. Tight oil. The leak occurred after the company shut the pipeline down on November 30 last year for routine maintenance after a heavy, wet snowfall. The weight of the snow caused a hillside to slump, and this, combined the absence of the usual pressure inside the pipeline, caused the pipeline to bend. One of the bends happened around a weld in the pipe, and the pipe cracked. Because the leak was not detected electronically, officials had to visually estimate the amount of oil that had leaked, leading to the underestimation. North Dakota's recent oil boom has left the state particularly vulnerable to these kinds of failures. Less than a third has been cleaned up. .... A farmer noticed the smell of oil permeating the air for days on end, and the wheels of his combine became coated in the stuff. Yet Bill Suess, a North Dakota Health Department environmental scientist, worries that much of the oil may never be removed. Whenever a failure occurs, companies will put protective measures in place to prevent further leaks. But failures continue to crop up to strengthen the resolve of many who oppose them, despite pushback from the Trump administration's pro-pipeline policies. There are no cases of livestock or wildlife deaths that were shown to be directly related to the spill, though there have been some cattle deaths and one dead beaver in the vicinity of the leak.

SIGNE DEAN 24 AUG 2017 Controversy around the Dakota Access Pipeline continues with the latest news that the company behind the oil pipeline is now suing Greenpeace and other environmental groups who were involved in extensive protests against the project. According to Reuters, ETP alleges that environmentalists used the Standing Rock Sioux tribe - the most public of the indigenous groups in opposition to the project - to wage a battle against the pipeline. Amongst grave concerns over Native American rights and the destruction of sacred ground, opponents of the project also expressed fears that the oil transport line - which is routed under the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation - would affect local drinking water. Even before officially starting operations, earlier this year it turned out that the pipeline had already sprung at least three relatively minor leaks, spilling more than 100 gallons (378 litres) of oil. Several indigenous groups in North and South Dakota, including the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, are still battling the pipeline in court. 5 days ago Politics & Society Semi-Automatic Rifles Really Are More Deadly, New Study Clearly Shows Numbers don't lie. 6 days ago Politics & Society To Save Ourselves It's Time to Rethink Our Economic System, Warn Scientists The market is killing the planet. 4 hours ago PHYSICS Single Hydrogen Atoms Could Form Eerie 'Ghost Bonds' With Nothing, New Study Shows It shouldn't be possible. 16 hours ago SPACE SpaceX Has Announced The First Tourist to Go to The Moon - And Take Other People With Him Such a wild project. 16 hours ago NATURE Potentially Deadly Threats Are Now Lurking in Post-Hurricane Flood Waters Hurricane Florence isn't over yet.

He wants to increase the extraction of oil and ship oil to other countries. President Trump also stated that he had the courage, energy, and will to organize and push through the Dakota Access Pipeline, despite organized protests by Native Americans, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and environmental groups. Trump suggested that greater economic growth and employment will be gained by drilling more U.S. oil and quickly passing oil to refineries. A new sitting president, believing he has an electoral mandate, has the right to overturn administrative decisions made by previous presidents. Republicans favor putting aside tribal and environmental concerns in favor of rapid economic development. President Trump seems more willing than former President Obama to encourage more oil drilling and shipping of oil to market, despite possible environmental or minority group disadvantages that might be caused by such actions. Recently, a federal judge ruled on the Dakota Access Pipeline controversy and found that the Army Corp of Engineers did not fully study or report on all significant tribal rights and environmental issues. A federal court ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to provide additional study and information about whether the Dakota Access Pipeline rupture could endanger water quality, affect fish, and animals hunted and consumed by Standing Rock Sioux tribal members. The court, however, did not order the owners of the Dakota Access Pipeline to stop shipping oil until new studies and arguments were made before the court. Usually projects that have not reported on significant environmental and human hazards are stopped until further review is completed. While additional studies, previously neglected, might show that the Standing Rock Sioux people and their hunting and fishing products are at risk from the Dakota Access Pipeline, such a finding would not necessarily lead to stopping pipeline oil shipments. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1970provides procedures for securing evidence about the possible negative environmental impacts of a project to harm local people, plants, and animals. The decision on whether to stop a project like the Dakota Access Pipeline depends on the goals and values of the sitting administration. During the 1970s, the Northern Cheyenne won a case declaring that the Northern Cheyenne reservation was guaranteed by treaty to have access to clean air. Similarly in 1998, Isleta Pueblo won the right to clean water against the City of Albuquerque, which was dumping unsafe water upstream from the tribe. In both cases, the administration and the Environmental Protection Agency strongly supported the tribes. A similar argument that Indigenous Peoples have rights to clean water and clean local environment, which are guaranteed and implied in treaty rights, could be made for the Standing Rock Sioux. However, the decision on whether to proceed with shipping oil depends on President Trump and his appointed administrators in the EPA. Indians have the right to file environmental studies, but do not have the power to overrule governments that will not honor tribal wishes. One could appeal to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), which in such cases ensures Indigenous Peoples free, prior and informed consent. However, within the rules of UNDRIP, Indigenous Peoples have the right to be heard, but the decision making on whether to approve a project belongs to the national government. Indigenous Peoples do not have the right to veto projects that will do them significant harm. Consequently, the tyranny of the majority holds sway over Indigenous Peoples.

Follow for news at the intersection of tech, biology, business, and squishy people stuff. Among them: Virginia and North Carolina received seven-figure payoffs from the pipeline company, Dominion, immediately before final state permitting approval. The legality of these payments is dubious at best. In fact, cheap, 24-hour renewable energy installations to replace coal as a baseload power source are already in the bid and build process. ACP has been marketed to local stakeholders as a jobs project that will bring manufacturing. There is little support for these claims. ACP has presented no evidence that energy costs are in fact a limiting factor for industrial development in Virginia and the Carolinas, or that the pipeline will truly address any industry needs. ACP partner Duke Energy has a history of manipulating natural gas supplies to drive up prices, when market structure has allowed them to do so. It has also abused this monopoly status to avoid accountability for coal ash spills, up to threatening to withhold power from federal military installations if fined. As a business strategist, I began looking into the ACP in mid-2017 so I could advise clients on what it would mean for their businesses. What I found was unconvincing. Findings and conclusions are summarized in the following report. These calculations do not include subsidies, tax credits, or externalities (e.g. damage from accidents, pollution-related costs such as increased healthcare, damage from accidents, etc). These figures are simply the bare cost of generating electricity by different methods. Wind and solar have been the true, unsubsidized, lowest-cost source of power in North Carolina for nearly two years. This is despite natural gas prices being at historical lows during those last two years. However, solar and wind are still competitive with natural gas even after accounting for firming. This is shown in detail in Figure 4. The remainder of the brief will focus on solar energy; with the understanding that many of the cost computations and local economic benefits of solar apply to wind as well. Storage technology has lagged behind generation technology. As a result, firming remains the main obstacle to adopting local energy. However, recent advances are making 24-hour renewable coverage competitive with conventional energy. Vanadium batteries have existed since the 1980s (2), but recent manufacturing advances have made them competitive at grid scale. Unlike lithium ion technology that uses intricate and damage-prone parts, vanadium batteries are extremely simple: two tanks of electrolyte and a membrane. This simplicity makes them safer (3), more robust (3), and much more affordable (2, 4) on a utility grid scale than lithium ion. Grid-scale vanadium battery use began with a 4 MWh installation in Japan in 2005 (5). A wind generation site in Dalian uses an 800 MWh vanadium battery for firming (2, 4, 6). China is also adding massive battery manufacturing capacity in anticipation of future demand. II. New technologies have lowered the breakeven cost. Figure 2 shows a history of US natural gas prices (generally set by the price at Henry Hub distribution point in Louisiana). Figure 3. Energy cost comparison, table, 2025 projection Important note: the variation in solar prices (shown by light blue caps and multiple bars for solar) are caused by different installation systems and types of financing. In other words, once a solar system is built and a payment system established, its price is set. All-weather reliability and stable prices allow businesses and homeowners to plan ahead with confidence. In contrast, electricity based on natural gas means unpredictable prices during good weather and outages during bad, hindering business operations, planning, and expansion. The result is drastic price spikes (12). A natural gas-based energy future for North Carolina is a hostile environment for business growth. These price shocks bring extreme unpredictability into business operations that can be devastating. Businesses cannot plan for expansion, hiring, investing in new equipment, or opening new locations without a stable cost outlook. IV. Figure 6. ACP outlook: natural gas cash outflows from North Carolina at different price points. A natural gas strategy takes advantage of this ingrained habit. Again, this strategy is a losing one for North Carolina as it has no sources of natural gas. These opportunities are especially strong in less urbanized areas with affordable land and simple permitting processes, which have historically struggled the most to find opportunities for growth. A brief example of statewide and local economic gains from a local energy is shown below. Figure 7 shows economic gains from solar for Cumberland County from generating its own solar energy; from exporting solar electricity for the Triangle market; and total revenues retained within the North Carolina economy from a statewide local energy strategy. VI. This is in line with the NC Clean Path projections (8), and is substantially higher than job growth possible with a gas-and-pipeline strategy. Figure 8. Construction and permanent full-time jobs in North Carolina, solar vs gas base power strategy. Actual solar job figures are likely to be higher due these factors. PV, wind, and batteries have both one-time installation and ongoing maintenance costs, just like pipelines and power plants. However, gas plants must also be fed fuel to operate. In contrast, once installed, local energy needs no inputs other than maintenance by workers (18). For this reason, a higher percentage of renewable installation costs go to salaries compared to gas. Operations and maintenance jobs for renewables are tasks like cleaning, preventive maintenance, repairs, grounds-keeping to prevent brush overgrowth, etc. These are abundant, accessible, permanent blue-collar jobs. Natural gas is a poor generator of employment in all regions, but especially for North Carolina. With no natural gas resources within its borders, this state has no base of natural gas construction workers. Welders, fitters, inspectors, manufacturers of pipeline parts, etc., must be brought in as contractors from natural gas-heavy areas like Texas and North Dakota. A solar strategy will engage skills and resources native to North Carolina, and build wealth that will stay in and continue to drive economic growth. VII. However, this was not always the case. The deregulation process was poorly designed, and by 2000 power shortages led to rolling blackouts and extreme hikes in power costs (15). Investigations found that generating companies, including Enron, had deliberately gamed markets to create artificial shortages and maximize profits through the resulting price spikes (13, 22, 23). Cheap natural gas needs an infrastructure of a few large, arterial pipelines. This raised gas prices in California, on top of the US-wide price increase. Gas power plants can shut down and restart fairly quickly compared to coal and nuclear. This is typically an advantage, as it allows gas plants to respond quickly to changes in demand. Recorded phone calls demonstrated an OPEC-like collaboration between energy suppliers to drive up prices (13, 22, 23). After agreeing to take the plant down, the Nevada official questioned the reason. Rich asks. These efforts succeeded in exaggerating natural price shocks. Deliberate price inflation through temporary plant shutdowns is not possible with coal, nuclear, wind, or solar. This type of market interference requires a power source that can be brought on- and offline at will. 1. An energy strategy that depends on imports is a poor strategy. Meanwhile, North Carolina has no gas fields. In other words, Duke Energy threatened national defense readiness to get out of cleaning up its own mess. However, it appears history is about to repeat itself. The rate payers, workers, and businesses of North Carolina will not benefit. VIII. IX. Industry requires intense heat and has traditionally used fossil fuels such as coal, coke, and natural gas. The state is positioned for success in several industries, including glass, semiconductors, ceramics, secondary metal processing, forestry, agriculture and food, high-tech textiles, composite manufacturing, and biorefining. These include raw metal production due to lack of ore resources, and the petroleum and chemical industries, due to lack of petroleum fields or refineries to provide raw materials (40). Imported natural gas can be used for process heat in petroleum and chemical refining, but it cannot be used as a feedstock (41). This brings high labor costs, which is more prohibitive than energy costs for most industries. These are costly to remediate. Glass, ceramics, and semiconductors: Require high-intensity heat to melt raw materials and control cooling. These methods all use electricity rather than combustion. Improved equipment now available means new pulp mills can generate steam entirely from their own waste (61, 62). Melting metal for casting is now done by electric arc furnace (invented 1879) or electric induction (invented 1903) (63). Melting steel and aluminum by electric induction takes about 600 kWh per ton (68). To be competitive when made US, metal manufacturing must be highly automated and make products for high-value end uses that need quality and precision. Combustion heating is incompatible with these end uses. However, biotechnology is opening up new opportunities in high-tech textiles where highly-skilled workers will be needed. North Carolina is poised to excel in this industry. Examples include biosynthetic production of spider silk for fashion and ballistic purposes (72), smart uniforms that camouflage their wearers from night-vision goggles (73), and more. Lab-grown biosynthetic fibers only require heat to warm incubators. Other high-tech fibers derived from glass, plastics, carbon nanotubes, etc require precise, clean conditions that are not compatible with combustion heating. Electric methods like induction, arc, microwave, vapor deposition, etc are required in this industry (74). Advanced resin curing methods currently in use for this industry include a variety of electromagnetic technologies including UV (45, 75), microwave (76), infrared (75), etc depending on type of composite. Energy needs for many facilities may be limited to warming incubators, and can be provided by burning waste biomass (77). Since energy use is drastically lower than traditional refining competitors, energy costs are not an important factor in this industry. Key to success in this industry are a high-tech worker population and low-cost agricultural feedstocks like cellulose, starch, oils, and protein. Industries that are competitive in North Carolina have process heat needs that are better met by biomass and electric sources such as induction, electric arc, laser stamping, electromagnetic curing, etc. These industry needs are better served by local wind and solar generation than by imported frack gas. One issue cited by solar and wind opponents is fear of obstructing training operations and pushing defense installations to relocate out of state. DoD has approved the vast majority of renewable energy projects that have applied, clearly demonstrating that local energy and military operations are compatible (78). Furthermore, fears of interfering with military operations ignore the fact that much of the world is adopting local energy. Farms that add solar power typically do so on only part of their land. Most farms have some acreage that has always yielded poorly. Works Cited 1. Dyer, James; Beach, Fred; King, C. The Full Cost of Electricity (FCe-). (2015). IEEE Spectrum (2017).

There is little support for these claims. partner Duke Energy has a history of manipulating natural gas supplies to drive up prices, when market structure has allowed them to do so. It has also abused this monopoly status to avoid accountability for coal ash spills, up to threatening to withhold power from federal military installations if fined. What I found was unconvincing. Findings and conclusions are summarized in the following report. 1: Lowest-cost energy sources in each county of North Carolina. These calculations do not include subsidies, tax credits, or externalities (e.g. damage from accidents, pollution-related costs such as increased healthcare, damage from accidents, etc). Wind and solar have been the true, unsubsidized, lowest-cost source of power in North Carolina for nearly two years. However, solar and wind are still competitive with natural gas even after accounting for firming. This is shown in detail in Figure 4. With grid-scale storage technologies are dropping rapidly in cost, the ACP is destined to be uncompetitive from the moment construction is finished. technology has lagged behind generation technology. As a result, firming remains the main obstacle to adopting local energy. Vanadium batteries have existed since the 1980s (2), but recent manufacturing advances have made them competitive at grid scale. Unlike lithium ion technology that uses intricate and damage-prone parts, vanadium batteries are extremely simple: two tanks of electrolyte and a membrane. This simplicity makes them safer (3), more robust (3), and much more affordable (2, 4) on a utility grid scale than lithium ion. Grid-scale vanadium battery use began with a 4 MWh installation in Japan in 2005 (5). Vanadium batteries have operated with an excellent safety and reliability record since that time (3). A wind generation site in Dalian uses an 800 MWh vanadium battery for firming (2, 4, 6). China is also adding massive battery manufacturing capacity in anticipation of future demand. New technologies have lowered the breakeven cost. Figure 2 shows a history of US natural gas prices (generally set by the price at Henry Hub distribution point in Louisiana). note: the variation in solar prices (shown by light blue caps and multiple bars for solar) are caused by different installation systems and types of financing. In other words, once a solar system is built and a payment system established, its price is set. reliability and stable prices allow businesses and homeowners to plan ahead with confidence. The result is drastic price spikes (12). These price shocks bring extreme unpredictability into business operations that can be devastating. 6. ACP outlook: natural gas cash outflows from North Carolina at different price points. A natural gas strategy takes advantage of this ingrained habit. brief example of statewide and local economic gains from a local energy is shown below. Figure 7 shows economic gains from solar for Cumberland County from generating its own solar energy; from exporting solar electricity for the Triangle market; and total revenues retained within the North Carolina economy from a statewide local energy strategy. PV, wind, and batteries have both one-time installation and ongoing maintenance costs, just like pipelines and power plants. However, gas plants must also be fed fuel to operate. In contrast, once installed, local energy needs no inputs other than maintenance by workers (18). These are abundant, accessible, permanent blue-collar jobs. Natural gas is a poor generator of employment in all regions, but especially for North Carolina. With no natural gas resources within its borders, this state has no base of natural gas construction workers. Welders, fitters, inspectors, manufacturers of pipeline parts, etc., must be brought in as contractors from natural gas-heavy areas like Texas and North Dakota. Most of their salaries will leave North Carolina immediately. However, this was not always the case. The deregulation process was poorly designed, and by 2000 power shortages led to rolling blackouts and extreme hikes in power costs (15). Investigations found that generating companies, including Enron, had deliberately gamed markets to create artificial shortages and maximize profits through the resulting price spikes (13, 22, 23). Most notably, then-Governor Gray Davis was ousted in a recall election for his perceived role in the crisis. Often neglected is that regardless of who drove the crisis, it was only possible thanks to a market structure dominated by natural gas. Fragile supply chains. Cheap natural gas needs an infrastructure of a few large, arterial pipelines. Gas power plants can shut down and restart fairly quickly compared to coal and nuclear. This is typically an advantage, as it allows gas plants to respond quickly to changes in demand. This is in contrast to coal and nuclear plants, which once online must stay running. Recorded phone calls demonstrated an OPEC-like collaboration between energy suppliers to drive up prices (13, 22, 23). After agreeing to take the plant down, the Nevada official questioned the reason. Rich asks. efforts succeeded in exaggerating natural price shocks. price inflation through temporary plant shutdowns is not possible with coal, nuclear, wind, or solar. This type of market interference requires a power source that can be brought on- and offline at will. An energy strategy that depends on imports is a poor strategy. Meanwhile, North Carolina has no gas fields. A natural gas strategy locks the entire state into dependence on one or two pipeline arteries carrying imported gas. A single incident can spark months of supply shortages and elevated prices. In other words, Duke Energy threatened national defense readiness to get out of cleaning up its own mess. North Carolina would be wise to think twice before entrusting its energy future to an entity with this track record. However, it appears history is about to repeat itself. Industry requires intense heat and has traditionally used fossil fuels such as coal, coke, and natural gas. The state is positioned for success in several industries, including glass, semiconductors, ceramics, secondary metal processing, forestry, agriculture and food, high-tech textiles, composite manufacturing, and biorefining. These include raw metal production due to lack of ore resources, and the petroleum and chemical industries, due to lack of petroleum fields or refineries to provide raw materials (40). Imported natural gas can be used for process heat in petroleum and chemical refining, but it cannot be used as a feedstock (41). Therefore metal refining, petroleum, and the conventional chemicals industry will not be considered in this review as they are not competitive in North Carolina for fundamental market reasons. Natural gas introduces defects and contaminants into the product (42, 46). This adds costs to metal processing, and makes silicon manufacturing (computer chips, solar cells, etc) impossible. Natural gas requires long heating times. ceramics, and semiconductors: Require high-intensity heat to melt raw materials and control cooling. These methods all use electricity rather than combustion. Improved equipment now available means new pulp mills can generate steam entirely from their own waste (61, 62). Melting metal for casting is now done by electric arc furnace (invented 1879) or electric induction (invented 1903) (63). Melting steel and aluminum by electric induction takes about 600 kWh per ton (68). To be competitive when made US, metal manufacturing must be highly automated and make products for high-value end uses that need quality and precision. Combustion heating is incompatible with these end uses. These all use electricity as their sources for process heat. Electricity, solar thermal, and biogas are sufficient to provide process heat needs for this industry. However, biotechnology is opening up new opportunities in high-tech textiles where highly-skilled workers will be needed. North Carolina is poised to excel in this industry.

Since energy use is drastically lower than traditional refining competitors, energy costs are not an important factor in this industry. Key to success in this industry are a high-tech worker population and low-cost agricultural feedstocks like cellulose, starch, oils, and protein. North Carolina is already well-positioned to succeed in biorefining using an all-renewable power grid. Industries that are competitive in North Carolina have process heat needs that are better met by biomass and electric sources such as induction, electric arc, laser stamping, electromagnetic curing, etc. fears of interfering with military operations ignore the fact that much of the world is adopting local energy. No use of rural land is needed. Farms that add solar power typically do so on only part of their land. Most farms have some acreage that has always yielded poorly. Supply interruptions, price spikes, outages, and even deliberate price manipulation are all established consequences of reliance on natural gas. Renewable local energy creates more jobs per megawatt-hour than imported natural gas, bringing better economic growth than natural gas without additional costs. Dyer, James; Beach, Fred; King, C.

Image People kayaking in the Animas River near Durango, Colo., last August, in water colored from a mine waste spill. The mines have filled with poison from water and air entering earth cavities, mixing with sulfurous minerals. The sludge coursed through Colorado, New Mexico and Utah. The E.P.A. is considering whether to declare the area around the Gold King a Superfund site. The Navajo reservation, a vast region of red rocks that sits south of the mine, was hit particularly hard by the spill because leaders told people not to use water from the San Juan River for weeks after the E.P.A. said it was safe. Mr. Begaye, the Navajo president, said he was wary of the claim that the stream was healthy enough for agricultural and other use. Irrigation lines were cut off. Corn, melons, hay and wheat never made it to market. The spill, the president said, delivered a psychological lashing in a drought-stricken place where water is gold, many live in poverty and the San Juan River holds financial and spiritual power. The lawsuit names several defendants: the E.P.A.; two contractors called Environmental Restoration and Harrison Western; four mining companies called Gold King Mines Corporation, Sunnyside Gold Corporation, Kinross in Canada and Kinross USA; and 10 unnamed individuals. It alleges that mismanagement of the mine, which had been closed for years but never cleaned up, caused it to swell with toxic water and eventually burst. Near the Gold King in Colorado, toxic water continues to flow out of the mine at a rate of 570 gallons a minute. A nearby water treatment plant put in place by the E.P.A. removes 95 percent of contaminants. The agency says that the water below the mine and the treatment facility has generally returned to prespill conditions, and local governments have instructed residents to resume recreational and agricultural activities on the Animas and San Juan Rivers. The suit is the latest to come out of the mine blowout. Earlier this year, New Mexico sued the E.P.A. and the State of Colorado over the accident.

Brent McDonald The Downside of the Boom By DEBORAH SONTAG and ROBERT GEBELOFF NOV. 23, 2014 North Dakota took on the oversight of a multibillion-dollar oil industry with a regulatory system built on trust, warnings and second chances. There had been an accident at the Skurupey 1-9H oil well. More in this Series Part 2 Where Oil and Politics Mix After an unusual land deal, a giant spill and a tanker-train explosion, anxiety began to ripple across the prairie. Nov. 23, 2014 Part 3 In North Dakota, a Tale of Oil, Corruption and Death Tex G. Hall, a tribal chief connected to the oil industry, has pushed profits on the Fort Berthold Reservation. But accusations of corruption and murder for hire have upended business as usual. Dec. 28, 2014 It was the 11th blowout since 2006 at a North Dakota well operated by Continental Resources, the most prolific producer in the booming Bakken oil patch. Two years earlier, a towering derrick in Golden Valley County had erupted into flames and toppled, leaving three workers badly burned. Blowouts represent the riskiest failure in the oil business. Yet, despite these serious injuries and some 115,000 gallons spilled in those first 10 blowouts, the North Dakota Industrial Commission, which regulates the drilling and production of oil and gas, did not penalize Continental until the 11th. In 2011, Andrew J. Rohr and two other workers were badly burned when a towering derrick erupted into flames and toppled. A small state that believes in small government, it took on the oversight of a multibillion-dollar industry with a slender regulatory system built on neighborly trust, verbal warnings and second chances. In recent years, as the boom really exploded, the number of reported spills, leaks, fires and blowouts has soared, with an increase in spillage that outpaces the increase in oil production, an investigation by The New York Times found. Its state leaders rarely mention the underside of the boom and do not release even summary statistics about environmental incidents and enforcement measures. The Times found that the Industrial Commission wields its power to penalize the industry only as a last resort. It rarely pursues formal complaints and typically settles those for about 10 percent of the assessed penalties. State regulators say they deliberately choose a collaborative rather than punitive approach because they view the large independent companies that dominate the Bakken as responsible and as their necessary allies in policing the oil fields. They prefer to work alongside industry to develop new guidelines or regulations when problems like overflowing waste, radioactive waste, leaking pipelines, and flaring gas become too glaring to ignore. Daryl Peterson taste-tests the residue left by a wastewater spill on land he farms. The highly saline spill rendered the land useless. At the same time, the state has significantly increased staffing to enforce environmental protections. One environmental incident for every 11 wells in 2006, for instance, became one for every six last year, The Times found. Through early October of this year, companies reported 3.8 million gallons spilled, nearly as much as in 2011 and 2012 combined. Over all, more than 18.4 million gallons of oils and chemicals spilled, leaked or misted into the air, soil and waters of North Dakota from 2006 through early October 2014. The spill numbers derive from estimates, and sometimes serious underestimates, reported to the state by the industry. State officials, who rarely discuss them publicly, sometimes use them to present a rosier image. In fact, the rate has risen sharply since the early days of the boom. He noted it is a federal agency, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, that regulates oil transmission pipelines. Most individual spills were contained to the immediate drilling area, but many of the largest spills polluted surrounding farms and waterways. Indeed, as the tangle of buried pipelines has grown, there have been no federal pipeline inspectors based in North Dakota. Continental Resources hardly seems likely to walk away from its 1.2 million leased acres in the Bakken. But the company, which has a former North Dakota governor on its board, has been treated with leniency by the Industrial Commission. From 2006 through August, it reported more spills and environmental incidents (937) and a greater volume of spillage (1.6 million gallons) than any other operator. What Continental paid Mr. Rohr, the injured driller, is guarded by a confidentiality agreement negotiated after a jury was impaneled for a trial this September. Mrs. Rohr said. Oil wells, shown in yellow, cover the agricultural landscape. Most have been built since 2006. Thousands of lines drilled underground connect the fracking operations to surface wells. Especially during the first years, officials were anxious that this oil boom, like previous ones, could be fleeting, that oil companies, if not embraced, could shift their rigs and capital investment to fields with less severe winters and better access to markets. Mr. Sattler said he tried to establish a protocol for field investigations, preparing a three-page checklist of procedures, including how to conduct witness interviews. Lynn D. Helms, the director of the North Dakota Department of Mineral Resources, advocates a collaborative, not punitive, approach to oil industry enforcement. By 2011, when it handed out 1,927 permits, it was still managing to issue them in 10 days. Some officials in western North Dakota challenged the accelerating pace. In the spring thaw of 2011, however, after a winter of record snowfall, scores of oil waste pits overflowed at once. The large, open pits, adjacent to rigs throughout the Bakken at that point, disgorged oil-based drilling mud that mixed with snowmelt and streamed across farmland and into stock ponds, creeks and river tributaries. Farmers were horrified; the local news media took note. Hess Oil was one target. Continental, like some other companies, disputed its responsibility. Its lawyer, a former counsel to the Industrial Commission, proposed that consent agreements state that the overflows were caused by unforeseeable extreme weather. That fall, at a commission meeting in Bismarck, Mr. Helms explained the logic behind the waste pit settlements. Bearded and deliberative, Mr. Helms is a petroleum engineer by trade, with a hand that bears the burn scars of an industrial accident. To his critics, Mr. Helms personifies a cozy relationship between the commission and oil companies. Mr. Helms, however, said that his background gives him access and authority, and that his job is to promote responsible development, not the industry. The commission has imposed its stiffest penalties on smaller companies. Mr. Helms said that problems in the oil patch were often the fault not of the major companies but of the contractors who do their physical labor. Judging by the data, the Health Department, overseen by civil servants and not elected officials, appears to have been tougher on the oil industry than the Industrial Commission has. Still, most of that revenue derived from a single industrywide enforcement action that, Mr. Glatt said, the industry itself requested. A task force was formed; the companies devised a new model for estimating the emissions and pledged to control them through devices. A ranch in Epping, N.D., is dotted with oil rigs and sliced by oil service roads. It sits along the road to the Lewis and Clark State Park. It raised awareness that spills of all magnitudes were daily and routine. It highlighted the inadequacy of pipeline monitoring. And it made clear that even in the worst cases the authorities are hesitant to use punitive sanctions. More than a year after the spill, neither the federal nor the state government has penalized the company responsible, Tesoro Logistics of San Antonio. But we use a carrot and stick approach. His wife called the operator of a nearby well, which contacted Tesoro, and both companies immediately sent out representatives. It was squirting out of the ground. In its initial report, Tesoro seriously underestimated the contamination. The spill was publicly disclosed only after local reporters learned of it, provoking an outcry from environmentalists that led to the creation of a spills website. In Tioga, a preliminary investigation found a small hole in the pipeline that appeared to have been caused by lightning, said the federal pipeline administration, whose final investigation has yet to be completed. Mr. Glatt said. Before the leak sprang in July 2013, Tesoro had not conducted an internal inspection of that segment of pipeline for eight years. Federal officials had last inspected the Tesoro network in North Dakota in 2010. Pipeline leaks are not the most common cause of spills; valve or piping connection problems are, The Times found. But they spew the greatest volume of oil and wastewater and are the most likely to cause pollution. Transmission pipelines, which carry oil to market, are not the only problem, however. Until this year, no authority, federal or state, monitored what Mr. Helms estimates to be 18,000 miles of gathering pipelines, which transport oil and wastewater from wells to collection sites. In fact, the North Dakota government does not even know their precise locations. In Tioga, the Jensens are inclined to look at the bright side, though 33 acres of their farmland have been cordoned off for an industrial cleanup operation expected to take at least another year. Neither the federal nor the state government has penalized the company responsible. Their corner of the state is like a cautionary tale. It is pocked with the remnants of 1980s oil production: abandoned wastewater ponds, some of which leached brine downward and outward, sterilizing the soil and shriveling crops. Though the industry now disposes of oil field brine primarily by injecting it deep underground, it still needs to be transported to disposal wells and remains a stubborn pollution problem. For every barrel of oil, about 1.4 barrels of brine is produced, state officials say, and far more of it spills than does oil. Three years ago, a farmer in the Antler audience experienced one of the largest oil field wastewater spills ever in North Dakota. A leaking wastewater line contaminated some 24 acres of farmland and eight surface ponds, and the site has yet to be restored to health. After the leak was detected, cleanup crews pumped out two million gallons of severely contaminated water, with chloride levels 2,700 times higher than normal, and a generator was still pumping out contaminants this summer. Meanwhile, that 24 acres has expanded, with Mother Nature, to the neighbors. Mr. Helms, in an email last year to his spokeswoman, Alison Ritter, estimated it at 332,000 gallons. Mr. Nelson, the legislator and agronomist, thinks it probably was three times that much. A farmer working a field, foreground, near oil wells outside Epping. North Dakota has shed its identity as an agricultural state in decline to become an oil powerhouse second only to Texas. But that is not a universally shared perspective. He said that almost all problems found by his inspectors were corrected within 30 days of verbal warnings. Some 2,500 warnings were issued last year, Ms. Ritter said; only 4 percent resulted in a written violation and only nine complaints were filed (up from four in 2012). All told, the number of wells is up 200 percent and spills 650 percent since 2004. The most encouraging statistic, Mr. Helms told the farmers, was that a higher proportion of individual spills were being contained to production sites. That is true according to the numbers he uses. Without engaging in any data analysis, the farmers in Antler were suspicious of the spill estimates because they were based on self-reporting by the industry. Indeed, The Times found scores of cases on that website where the release of pollutants was not just undercounted but marked as zero. One supposedly zero-volume wastewater spill in Bottineau County last year required the removal of 600 dump-truck loads of contaminated soil. The state spills site posts incidents in chronological order, without summary statistics, and it is not searchable. Oil and gas enforcement data is not made public at all, unlike in Texas, where the legislature mandates quarterly reports. It found that companies in the Bakken spill at different rates. This suggests to some experts that companies could do more to prevent and minimize environmental incidents. Interactive Database Spills in North Dakota Open Interactive Database This database contains all reported spills from Jan. 1, 2006, to Oct. 13, 2014. Based on volume, Statoil has produced 9,000 gallons of oil for every gallon of spillage; Continental has produced 3,500. Statoil contained some 70 percent of its spill volume to production sites. Continental contained less than half, The Times found. And I totally understand why. The public never knew the blowout had occurred because the well, like many new wells, had been granted confidential status by the state for competitive reasons; almost everything except its existence was off the record for six months. Oil, water and chemicals shot 40 feet into the air from the wellhead but did not ignite. One worker was injured with a broken finger and bruises to his head and chest, the sheriff said. The oil misted over hundreds of acres, contaminating hundreds of bales of hay and alfalfa fields. They left no stones unturned, as far as I was concerned. Mr. Rohr, the injured driller, sued Continental Resources. The case was settled. Rich Addicks for The New York Times The wreckage of the rig Mr. Rohr and his co-workers were working on. Erick J. Hartse During the voir dire process, many prospective jurors had revealed just how interwoven their lives were not only with the oil industry, but also with Continental. Some had worked for or done business with Continental; others owned its stock or received royalty checks from Continental wells. Asked if they had strong feelings about the oil boom, almost all, even those who saw the positive, raised their hands to say they thought it had had negative consequences, too. The next morning, a settlement was reached. Later, in a nearby hotel, sitting with his lawyers, his wife and a former co-worker, Mr. Rohr lifted his T-shirt to reveal what he had been prepared to show the jury: his pink, waffled back, patched together through skin grafts after the rig at the Beaver Creek State 1-36H well exploded into flames on July 24, 2011. And then that big blast hit me. I was a big ball of flame, running out of there, my safety glasses melting around my eyes. I thought I was blind. Mr. Rohr, who is called A.J., stared into his coffee cup, crying. Erick Hartse, 23, who had been his assistant driller and escaped injury in the blowout, winced. Mr. Rohr and two colleagues were airlifted to a burn center in Minneapolis. With serious burns over 60 percent of his body. Mr. Rohr spent a month hospitalized. Still in constant pain and reliant on painkillers, he has not returned to the oil fields, the only job he has ever known. The two men and their boss, Wally Dschaak, said they thought from the start that the well, situated in a remote, serene spot about a mile from the Little Missouri River, was going to give them trouble. Continental, which declined to discuss the case, imported oil fire specialists from Texas to extinguish the blaze. Later, Cyclone sent Mr. Hartse to Wyoming to help build a replacement rig, he said, but did not allow him to accompany it back to North Dakota.

ETP will most likely miss this deadline, if for no other reason than lack of clearance. The company recently informed investors that it would take from 90 to 120 days to complete the pipeline after it receives an easement from the Army Corps of Engineers to cross the Missouri River. The corps has yet to give that permission and indeed this week recommended further study on the question. As a result of ETP missing its deadline, companies that have committed long-term to ship oil through the pipeline at 2014 prices would have the right to rescind those commitments. In the interest of protecting their investors and shareholders, these companies may well renegotiate terms, seeking concessions on contracted volumes, prices, or contract duration. Global oil prices began to collapse just a few months after shippers committed to using DAPL, and consensus market forecasts see no recovery for at least a decade. Rather than growing as previously projected, production in the Bakken Shale oil field has fallen for nearly two consecutive years, creating major financial hardships for drillers, who may be eager to renegotiate the terms of their contracts with DAPL.

These 1000s strong intrepid folks are supported nationally and internationally by 100,000s. Last week a long-awaited district court ruling in Des Moines gave DA, ETP, Enbridge, and Marathon and their big financial backers what they wanted. This pipeline would make that prospect increasingly difficult, because it is designed to facilitate the continuing extraction of the Bakken Shale in North Dakota. Worse than that, this pipeline represents the further colonization of indigenous lands, particularly that which lie adjacent to or solidly within the path of this project. None of this is necessary. The 100,000s of people who oppose the Dakota Access Pipeline understand this. On the contrary, the existing evidence shows the protesters to be peaceful, non violent, and very sympathetic to the needs and concerns of the pipeline workers. Sunoco Logistics Partners, which is headquartered in Newtown Square, is another key pipeline investor along with ETP, and the Dakota Access Pipeline is slated to feed into a Sunoco Logistics terminal. What an irony: Pennsylvania science teachers are out on the front lines teaching school kids about the impact of global warming at the same time their retirement dollars are hard at work building this monstrosity of a pipeline. How typical that the Keystone State is going in the other direction from the rest of the enlightened world. It is true that several Building Trades unions have supported this project, based on misleading claims told by Dakota Access and its parent company, Energy Transfer, that it would create 1000s of local jobs. In reality, however, the project will only create a couple dozen local, permanent jobs and maybe a couple of temporary contractor jobs, which Dakota Access has already said would be hired from elsewhere. Many unions courageously opposed Keystone XL, and they should do no less to the Dakota Access Pipeline. As for jobs, there are already more workers employed in the renewable energy sector than in fossil fuels in the US and Canada, and those differences are only going to become increasingly more stark as the world transitions from a fossil fuel based energy system to one based on renewables. That transition will happen whether the new green jobs are union or not. It is therefore incumbent upon unions to embrace the transition and organize these new jobs, because green capitalism is still capitalism. The union movement should therefore take a clue from forward thinking workers and union activists including the fine folks in Climate Workers, Iron and Earth, Labor Network for Sustainability, Movement Generation, National Nurses United, Trade Unions for Democracy, and the IWW Environmental Unionism Caucus (among others), and develop an organizing strategy for a Just Transition that includes and encompasses organizing the unorganized renewable energy workers. And there is an urgent need to focus efforts doing just that. And what we need is those skilled laborers to be put to work, pipelines for people. I am all for organized labor, but what I want is I want pipelines, I want infrastructure, for people, not for fossil fuels, not for oil companies. So I am all for that. There are plenty of people that could be put to work. And let us be absolutely clear: not all jobs are just jobs. One would scarcely be standing upon the moral high ground if they justified the construction of Nazi or Stalinist death camps if the jobs building them were union jobs. This is a dead end strategy and will only serve to further weaken the union movement. We must break the harmful alliance between unions and the energy bosses and build active working class solidarity with Native people and all those fighting to defend the earth from capitalist exploitation and destruction. The union movement can be sure to be on the right side by sending members to join the fight, by coming to the Standing Rock or Red Warrior Camps (or at least send money to support them). They can pass resolutions against the Dakota Access Pipeline. They can join or organize demonstrations against the DAPL (or its financial supporters) within their communities. There are many rank and file union members who already stand in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Before the Commerce Department defended the move last week, Jack Gerard, the president and CEO of the American Petroleum Institute, said the president's announcement of a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff for aluminum was inconsistent with Trump's goal of U.S. energy dominance. The U.S. Association of Oil Pipe Lines, meanwhile, said the administration should use caution when considering new tariffs. Hundreds of millions of dollars could be added to the cost of major pipeline projects like Keystone XL and take jobs out of the U.S. economy. RELATED Zinke criticized for Wild-West mentality over oil and gas The Trump Administration has since offered exemptions to some U.S. trade partners and John Stoody, a spokesman for the pipeline trade group, said domestic industries deserve relief as well. In one of his first moves in office, Trump facilitated the approval process for the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. Sandy Fielden, the director for oil and products research at Morningstar, said earlier this month that steel tariffs in particular could throttle the U.S. energy sector because of the increase for pipeline projects like Keystone XL. RELATED Stocks, oil prices lower on tariff hike jitters Adding a 25 percent tariff to steel would increase the cost of U.S. pipelines significantly, he said. Oil and gas companies, meanwhile, could be forced to cancel projects because of the higher price for steel.

Although further details have yet to be released, chief executive Rob Sheppard announced that the results were encouraging. However, Somalia, and potential investors, should proceed with caution when considering entering this frontier market. East African oil exploration, and in Somalia specifically, is not a secret . Energy firms like Royal Dutch Shell and Exxonmobil operated in Somalia before the government collapsed in 1991. But recent gains against the insurgent group al Shabaab in the south and the decrease in piracy off the coast have sparked a regeneration of the industry. The paper discusses how the oil industry in Somalia could have a promising future, but it also explores the risks facing Somalia if the development of its petroleum resources is not carefully managed. The historic challenges that have limited business opportunities in Somalia, domestic insurgency and piracy, have diminished for now, but these threats have not disappeared. Al Shabaab has been largely pushed out of southern Somalia by multinational forces, but has recently proven that it is still able to operate in the north of Kenya . As Kenya flexes to counter al Shabaab in its own country, it could provide an opportunity for al Shabaab to return to its previous strongholds in Somalia. And even as piracy has largely stopped, it is conceivable that al Shabaab or others could see oil tankers as opportunities to resurrect that practice as well. Beyond these security challenges there may be political disadvantages to developing the hydrocarbon sector in Somalia. Balthasar notes, among other things, that oil will likely exacerbate existing rifts and political tensions. In the context of the recent political turmoil and contentious federalism process, it is clear that any foreign oil companies would face a high degree of political instability and uncertainty. Balthasar also points out that the legal and constitutional conditions in Somalia are ambiguous in determining who can enter or negotiate contracts with oil companies. Without a well-defined regulatory environment for oil and gas resources, federal states, semi-autonomous regions, and the central government could all separately negotiate and enter into conflicting extraction agreements with private companies. The opaque regulatory nature of these resources has already proven problematic in the semi-autonomous regions of Puntland and Somaliland. This is all likely to lead to further turmoil and maybe even conflict over profitable fields and the distribution of revenues. Somalia is probably not ready for oil development. With excellent access to shipping lanes and supposedly massive untapped wealth (perhaps as much as 110 billion barrels) it is no surprise that multinational oil companies are intrigued, but responsible investors would be wise to think twice. The underlying political instability and security challenges of Somalia will likely inhibit the long term feasibility and profitability of these projects.

Indemnity refers to a financial instrument where one party agrees to be liable to pay money or perform an obligation against an anticipated loss. There is already a Trans Mountain pipeline in use since 1953; the expansion project would triple the capacity of oil and other petroleum products shipped from producers in Alberta's oilsands, up to 890,000 barrels per day, to a terminal in the metro Vancouver suburb of Burnaby, B.C.

He repeatedly declined to discuss the substance of negotiations. Alberta Premier Rachel notley on Parliament Hill on April 15, 2018. But Notley rejected Singh's comments in comments to reporters from the Alberta legislature later on Wednesday. Notley also said her government was poised to pass Bill 12, which will give Alberta the ability to restrict energy shipments. She also acknowledged that Kinder Morgan and Ottawa don't yet see eye-to-eye. Finance Minister Bill Morneau speaks to reporters in Ottawa on May 16, 2018. Chief Phil Lane, Chief John Ridsdale, Chief Dziggott, Harriet Prince and Linda Blackelk lead a protest of thousands against Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain expansion project in Burnaby, B.C. on March 10, 2018. The Alberta oilsands, deposits of a tar-like heavy oil mixed with clay beneath the boreal forest in Alberta and Saskatchewan, represent the third largest reserve of crude oil in the world. But oilsands extraction is costly and energy-intensive, and oil producers in the region have struggled to compete in international markets. But opponents say Canada will never be able to meet its climate goals unless it stops expansion of the oilsands industry. Squamish Nation councillor Khelsilem speaks at a press conference held by the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion on May 2, 2018. Protests by Indigenous leaders and environmental activists in metro Vancouver is also what drove the company to suspend construction activities last month. Hundreds of people have been arrested at the site of a Kinder Morgan terminal. First Nations are engaged in an ongoing legal challenge at the Federal Court of Appeal over whether the Crown adequately consulted First Nations before announcing its approval of the pipeline expansion in 2016.

This smooching of the corporate derriere is a bit much for this Canadian taxpayer to handle.... I guess we can begin again to be hewers of wood, and haulers of water. Just remember, slaves are never happy...and some have long memories, especially at election time. These people are despicable and this bail out is nothing short of treason. Also, I think that Notley should be kicked out of the NDP- she has shown her true color and it definitely not orange. These people are despicable and this bail out is nothing short of treason. Also, I think that Notley should be kicked out of the NDP- she has shown her true color and it is definitely not orange. reply Makes me wonder. At this point, Kinder Morgan's game plan may not even be to build the blasted thing. Playing along with this would make the Trudeau government either naive or very cynical and corrupt. Or maybe Trudeau himself naive, and certain top political operatives cynical and corrupt. At some point we're going to have to recognize that many of our best policies are on paper only. Like consulting with indigenous people....its a beautiful idea, if only those indigenous folks could see themselves to agreeing with our extractivist schemes. But when they don't...we just have to find some way around them....and, eh....some way through their land. As usual: We pay, they get the money. Be bad enough if it was our own bloodsuckers, but Trudeau wants to send billions of dollars out of the country so foreigners can poison us better. That would be 1 million dollars per 10 year job, or 8,000 jobs for 10 years--probably more than the pipeline would have employed. With multipliers, probably 20,000 jobs; with revenues paying just half the expenses, 40,000 jobs. Plus you'd end up with a whole lot of clean power or increased energy efficiency. But no, instead he's going to give the dough to billionaire Texans so they can make tar spills. The logic is pretty impeccable...he's counting on the Canadian taxpayer (dumb clucks that many of us are) to turn on the people who will continue to protest....instead of on the government that is going to use our tax dollars to keep fossil fuels flowing well into armegeddon. When those dry up, we can look forward to the fires. Apparently, in carbon tax avoidant Saskatchewan, they are already well under way. So the money we pay hoping for good social policy and a future for our children is going to go down the tubes of more fossil fuel extraction............and environmental disaster clean up. And I haven't even calculated in the money we're going to have to spend cleaning up Alberta from the god awful mess they've left behind....in tailings ponds and unclosed old well heads. Liars like Kenny can promise it, but I don't see any in sight. Now there's a platform waiting for some ambitious Con. The oil sands project is not competitive in the first place. So everytime there is a glut of oil on the world market they can't even sell the oil at cost . Canada is the only G7 country that does not have a high speed train and the route between Calgary and Edmonton could be a good start. We could also use our own Bombardier to build the trains creating more employment. Maintaining a high speed train would create lasting employment unlike a pipeline. reply That would be amazing. Support our own companies, provide long term jobs and get people to where they want to go. sounds like a win-win to me."}, {"URL": "http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Empire-Files-Chevrons-Environmental-Damages-in-Ecuador-Part-2-20160824-0006.html", "Timestamp": "20180919005236", "Sentences": "If you intend to use it, please cite the source and provide a link to the original article. RELATED: Ecuador Indigenous Groups Ravaged by Chevron Will Fight On In 1993, a group of 30,000 Indigenous villagers from the Ecuadorian Amazon organized the Union of People Affected by Texaco, or UDAPT. Together they filed a class action lawsuit against Chevron for its harmful behavior, including spilling 60 billion liters of toxic water into the Amazon. ANALYSIS: Correa: 'Corruption' Lets Chevron off Hook for Amazon Pollution Chevron tried to convince the court that their harmful practices did not cause any health issues, by paying experts to support their innocence. With their team of well paid lawyers and experts they dragged the case out, which in turn stretched the economically weak UDAPT. And that the case is not just important to Chevron, but also to other corporations that are immune from being held accountable for their environmental neglect. Fajardo also explained that Chevron had a vested interest in global conflict as a pretext for the cheap exploitation of oil. Chevron has a dark past as the first U.S. oil company to support and sell oil to Spain's fascist dictator Francisco Franco, as well as Mussolini in Italy and Hitler in Nazi Germany. Chevron also exploited oil reserves in developing countries, particularly in Latin America but also in Niger and Burma. It was the first time an Indigenous group has successfully sued an oil company. Chevron refused to pay, pulling operations out of Ecuador and hiding their assets in other parts of the world, making it difficult for victims to gain compensation. Numerous witness and supporters were paid by Chevron to influence legal outcomes, allowing them to evade justice."}, {"URL": "http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/3PV2U9BK4AWAJ", "Timestamp": "20180918233453", "Sentences": "Date(); EN Hello.

Boasberg, citing the the tribe waited too long to bring up the claim under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Victoria Tauli-Corpuz United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Victoria Tauli-Corpuz stated on Monday that Native Americans have the right to defy undue pressures by extractive projects such as the Dakota Access Pipeline. In a scathing report, Tauli-Corpuz said the United Nations is concerned about the safety of indigenous peoples, their cultures, their sacred sites, and their human rights issues in the United States. During her human rights mission for the United Nations, Tauli-Corpuz said she discovered widespread discrimination at local and national levels. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe was not consulted as a sovereign nation. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continually dismissed risks and did not conduct an adequate cultural assessment before authorizing the pipeline to cross Lake Oahe or authorized the dumping of materials and waste into waters on Indian reservations, Tauli-Corpuz said. The Army Corps utilized a loophole in environmental assessment laws by fast tracking permits, and after the agency approved an environmental assessment study earlier this year, it backtracked and issued the final easement permit. Public Service Commissioner Julie Fedorchak has stated that the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe was contacted from the beginning of the pipeline planning stages. The problem is not contained only to Standing Rock, but widespread throughout the USA, Rauli-Corpuz said. In addition to local and federal government dismissiveness, Native Americans face the full force of negative health impacts from extraction, with rising levels of heavy metals in water and contamination in livestock from spills, faulty well construction, and the effects of frakking, or toxic and non-biodegradable discharges into surface waters. With few legal options left to halt Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Dakota Access, LLC, Standing Rock and supporters are preparing to march in Washington DC on March 10 at the Native Nations Rise campaign. Boom The North Dakota political machine has been repeatedly rated one of the worst in the United States for transparency by political watchdogs such as The Center for Public Integrity, and its reactions toward the Dakota Access Pipeline controversy have been scrutinized by press from around the world. Before pipeline construction began, a 78-page assessment report was compiled by Iowa-based Strategic Economics Group, Inc., written by Harvey Siegelman, Mike Lipsman, and Dan Otto, for Energy Transfer Partners. The pipeline companies promised jobs, growth, and stability, according to the November 12, 2014 report entitled Assessment of the Economic and Fiscal Impacts of the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, and Illinois. More than two years after the report was written, one of the authors, Lipsman, said he felt that the report will prove accurate, but that at least two more years were needed for government agencies to compile all the necessary information. Crews moved from state to state, Lipsman said, and although the actual number of people on the job might be less than what Strategic Economics Group, Inc. reported, he calculated job hours, and not actual personnel numbers. The Dakota Access Pipeline used less than 57 percent American-made steel, according to the Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now, an industry group lobbying for completion of the pipeline. Piles of steel tubes are scattered throughout the Midwest. EVRAZ is owned in part by Roman Abramovich, a Russian multi-billionaire who assisted President Vladimir Putin into office in the late 1990s, according to DeSmog. Production of oil rebounded to 942,455 barrels in December 2016. Winona LaDuke, a longtime activist and founder of Honor the Earth, disagrees with the math behind Bakken oil. LaDuke says the Bakken oil patch is busted, and the state should be focused more on infrastructure on people rather than for companies. More people today are employed in solar energy facilities than in oil patches, LaDuke said, and the future does not rest with fossil fuels. Government projections estimate 900,000 barrels of oil will be hauled out of the Bakken per day until 2019. The workforce and mineral rights On the ground reporting, live streaming videos, and reports from activists in the field rarely reported seeing local license plates on Dakota Access Pipeline vehicles, semis, or trucks. And while the state has been quite content bringing in outside companies, supplies, and an out-of-state workforce for the project, its response has shown contempt against all outside activists fighting the Dakota Access Pipeline. The North Dakota Joint Information Center frequently posts updates on arrests, identifying repeatedly that out of the 761 people arrested, 94 percent were not from North Dakota. Most of the jobs were short term, but members are already back at work across the state, she said. Her union currently has approximately a dozen workers involved at the drill pad crossing the Missouri River. None replied to telephone calls for comment. Not including transportation and construction jobs, the Bakken workforce has increased from 5,000 jobs in 2005 to 81,500 in 2013, Sandstrom reported. North Dakota has more than 400 individuals and 115 companies or independent contractors who are involved in the drilling and well production processes in the Bakken, Sandstorm said. There are also 117 certified native-owned companies that provide oil and gas development services. According to a 2014 study made public by the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, more than 876 business in North Dakota are part of the larger oil and natural gas supply chain. Exact numbers of people employed or those who are benefitting from the Dakota Access Pipeline, such as mineral rights owners, are at best difficult to pin down. Gary Preszler, chairman for National Host Production Deduction Committee and former commissioner for North Dakota Land Management, also owns a large mineral interest in Billings County, from which he said the royalty payments have put his children through college. The history of mineral rights in North Dakota is confusing even to oil company accountants, and many mistakes have been made in the past, Preszler said. The puzzle dates back to the 1930s Great Depression when many farmers and ranchers sold their mineral rights to survive. At the beginning, the state kept five percent of the mineral rights giving 95 percent to purchasers, then in the late 1940s, the state began keeping 50 percent, then 100 percent in the 1960s, Meszler said. Professional oil workers and oil companies also have purchased mineral rights directly from landowners. Today, third generation cousins scattered across the United States and oblivious to their ownership titles also are heirs to mineral rights, Preszler said. Oil price swings, production tapering, and mechanical failures fluctuate royalty checks. The Minerals Management Division of the Department of North Dakota Trust Lands manages 2.567 million mineral acres throughout the state, of which 1.215 million mineral acres are in the oil and gas producing counties, and another 1.352 million acres are in non-producing counties. Schools and other trusts own 1.84 million acres, and foreclosed properties formerly managed by the Bank of North Dakota and Sovereign Lands make up the remaining 728,000 mineral acres. The state of North Dakota covers 45,250,560 acres, according to North Dakota Studies, of which, including some acreage in South Dakota, 4,689,920 acres are on Native American reservations. The Bakken oil patch, in its entirety, spans approximately 15,360,000 acres.

He was upset and spoke rapidly about the area behind him, an expanse of the Great Plains cut by a new 150-foot-wide road. Two days before, Mentz had testified to the D.C. District Court to report the area that lay in the path of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) corridor holds 82 cultural features and 27 graves. By the next day, DAPL construction workers graded the area. Behind where Mentz stood in the video was a place known as the Strong Heart Society Staff, where a sacred rattle or staff was placed within stone rings. Here members of the elite warrior society would come to make pledges. As an anthropologist who has worked with Native Americans for more than a decade to document their sacred places in the paths of new power plants, power lines, water pipelines and more, the battle in North Dakota is all too familiar. The stand-off between Native Americans in North Dakota and an oil pipeline project developer and police forces has inspired protests across the country. Consultation with tribes too often breaks down because federal agencies are unwilling to consider how Native Americans view their own heritage. Irreplaceable heritage If completed, the Dakota Access Pipeline would run from North Dakota to Illinois for nearly 1,200 miles, carrying up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day. DAPL would meander across the landscape, through farms, around cities, buried underground and across more than 200 waterways. The passage of the pipeline over and under waterways requires permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This federal authorization in turns requires compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). When considering a new undertaking, a number of effects on historic properties must be considered: direct (like physical destruction), indirect (like spoiling a viewshed), short-term, long-term, or cumulative (like how one pipeline may not harm a site, but perhaps a dozen of them will). The NHPA does not guarantee preservation. For many years, Native Americans would have had little input on a project such as DAPL. But in 1992, Congress amended the NHPA to formally include traditional cultural properties. The amendments directed federal agencies, in carrying out their responsibilities under the NHPA, to consult with Indian tribes that attach religious and cultural significance to these sacred places. Beyond consultation In North Dakota, federal and state review and compliance measures for DAPL were combined. Engineers rerouted DAPL to avoid all but nine sites. Archaeologists serve an important role in documenting historic properties. But they tend to view the world through the lens of science and history. They search out buried villages, pottery shards, bones, broken stone tools. Traditional cultural properties in the U.S. can often be archaeological sites, artifacts that ancestors once touched and places that mark ancestral homes. But just as often they can be a mountain where spirits dwell or a spring where water is gathered for ceremonies. They can be a traditional area for collecting plants or animals that sustain and heal communities. They can be origin places where ancestors emerged onto the earth or named places recalled in ancient tongues. This is why documenting traditional cultural properties requires not the work of archaeologists but Native Americans as well. On one project I conducted with the Hopi tribe to detail cultural resources along a 470-mile power line, we needed weeks of research to identify more than 200 plant species that the tribe uses in its traditional religious and healing practices. When it comes to traditional practices, Native Americans see what archaeologists overlook. Tribal surveys For DAPL, a tribal survey was not undertaken. In North Dakota the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers tried to engage in consultation dozens of times, but the Standing Rock Sioux largely refused because the federal agency only wanted to consult on a narrow corridor at water crossings instead of the entire pipeline. Once, though, consultation did occur at Lake Oahe on March 8, 2016. Current designs call for the pipeline to go under this now controversial waterway, which the Sioux want protected. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials admitted they were unaware of some of these sites. On Sept. 21 and then again on Oct. 20, according to an email I received from the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Office, delegations that included law enforcement, Standing Rock Sioux officials and tribal and state archaeologists went to the areas that Mentz suggested contained 82 sites and 27 burials. Two bones were recovered, but analysis showed them to be from a horse, cow, or bison. It would seem that the main sites Mentz agonized over had escaped physical destruction. However, tribal input would be needed to determine if the sites, so close to the corridor, could still suffer from indirect and cumulative impacts. Not too late Because consultation broke down and so little of the pipeline has received tribal survey, we must wonder how much has been missed. Nearly 90 percent of the pipeline has already been completed. Chip Colwell This is an unfortunate but common occurrence. Last month I went out with traditional leaders of the Zuni tribe in New Mexico to identify traditional cultural properties under the NHPA in the path of a massive network of water pipelines. When we arrived, we found dozens of construction workers busily laying the new pipe. An archaeological survey was already completed; the construction had begun with the consent of the federal agency. We were too late. Read the original article. Look for it in your email each Saturday.

BNSF, the largest railroad in North Dakota, reported its national volumes were down 6 percent in the first quarter of this year compared to last year, and coal shipments alone were down 33 percent. Its first quarter profits dropped 25 percent. But BNSF isn't the only railroad experiencing a downturn. U.S. carload traffic dropped 16.1 percent in April compared to the same month in 2015, according to the Association of American Railroads. But excluding coal, carloads were down just 2.8 percent from April 2015. John Gray, the senior vice president of policy and economics at the AAR, said in a statement low natural gas prices and high coal stockpiles at power plants are hurting coal traffic. Coal represented roughly 21 percent of freight ending in North Dakota in 2012, according to the AAR. Meanwhile, exports of crude oil by rail out of the Williston Basin, which includes North Dakota, has dropped from more than 800,000 barrels per day in late 2014 to roughly 500,000 barrels per day in February, according to the estimates from the North Dakota Pipeline Authority. Crude oil was the second-largest rail commodity originating in North Dakota, according to the AAR's 2012 data, with farm products coming out on top. Canadian Pacific, the other major railroad in North Dakota, reported a 15 percent drop in its U.S. grain carloads in the first quarter of this year, contributing to an overall decline of 4 percent. BNSF's volumes of agriculture products were up 1 percent in the first quarter of this year. Workforce down Those diminishing shipment numbers mean BNSF has furloughed 4,500 transportation employees nationwide. While a spokeswoman didn't have specific numbers for North Dakota, a union official said furloughs peaked around 400 just a few months ago but have since come down slightly. McBeth pushed back against that argument. Employment at the country's largest railroads was down 10.7 percent in March compared to March 2015, declining from 172,195 to 153,723, according to AAR spokesman Ed Greenberg. But Hatch said railroads are also benefiting from higher productivity thanks to improvements in its network over the past few years. This can be removed when origin is fixed.

Distribute. Fallen Warriors Obituaries to fallen warriors. Journal. Newswire A banner drop in Asheville, North Carolina against pipelines. On February 26, workers were heading into the woods of West Virginia to begin preparations for boring through Peters Mountain when they found two treesits directly in their path. If completed, the boring would allow the proposed Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP) to go through the mountain and under the Appalachian Trail, continuing to expand the web of interconnecting pipes engulfing the Eastern US to meet with the preexisting Transcontinental Compressor Station. The company announced this month that they also have plans to transfer gas from MVP into the Southgate pipeline project, which would extend south into North Carolina. People have fought the Mountain Valley Pipeline in court for years, but the treesits inspired a cascade of direct action that shows no sign of stopping. Shortly after the sits were discovered, Mountain Valley Pipeline workers started clearing trees near them, and a temporary restraining order was filed against the sitters by the pipeline company (this was later allowed to expire by a judge, who also denied an injunction MVP was pursuing against them). A closure of parts of the forest was also issued by the Forest Service. The restraining order and closure were delivered to the sits with no real results. As MVP workers, the Forest Service, and police continued to tape orders to trees in a futile effort to drive away the treesitters, people in Virginia, West Virginia, and around the country expressed support and held solidarity actions. Many farmers and landowners in the area were adamant that they were on the side of those in the trees, and have brought supplies to the sitters and gathered nearby to provide support and protection. People have also been fighting MVP in a variety of ways on the ground, including following cutting crews working after the March 31 tree clearing deadline (meant to protect birds and bats) and reporting the cutting to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). These people were continuously threatened with arrest by cops. Meanwhile, FERC and MVP are sending a number of mixed messages: MVP has said the deadline only applies to certain trees, while FERC claims that they can cut if a biologist is on site. On March 28, the fight intensified when a fifty-foot monopod was set up in the middle of Pocahontas Road. It is now the longest-standing continuously occupied monopod we know of. Though cops, workers, and Forest Service personnel can still approach the area behind the monopod on foot or on ATVs, they can no longer drive cars or trucks there, which has stopped the construction of a road leading to the drilling site and helped protect the treesitters deeper in the woods. The monopod was immediately joined by a rally of supporters helping to blockade the road, after which someone acting as direct support for the person in the monopod was arrested by police. Police also touched and shook the monopod, endangering the life of the person inside. Photo of Peters Mountain treesits and monopod from Appalachians Against Pipelines Forest Service employees, workers, and police have been shining bright lights on the monopod during the night, driving ATVs dangerously close to the lines anchoring the monopod, and blocking deliveries of food and water. They have also forced supporters to move their camp further from the base of the monopod. At the time of this writing, MVP security and US Forest Service employees are now camped near the monopod and the treesit on Peters Mountain 24 hours a day. In early April, another supporter was arrested. The 61-year-old treesitter, known as Red, is a local landowner and mother. After a few days, MVP threatened to take legal action against her family if she did not come down. Not only did she ignore this threat, the next day her daughter launched another treesit on their land. Collectively known as Little Teel Crossing, the sits are over 75 feet in the air, near Little and Teel creeks, where an endangered fish, the Roanoke logperch, lives. MVP is now pursuing legal action against the family, threatening arrest and fines for their opposition to the project. One remains, despite increasing intimidation, workers getting dangerously close, and even failed extraction attempts. On April 22, three people were arrested attempting to resupply the monopod. That same day, one of the original treesits was removed by MVP security after over 50 days. A few weeks later, on May 5, Red and her daughter finally came down from the trees as well. Red said she was not about to pay fines to MVP, and vowed to continue the fight on the ground. But the other treesit on Peters Mountain remains, as does one treesit at Little Teel Crossing and the monopod. With resistance against MVP spreading and their stock dropping drastically, it looks like the company is going to have a pretty bad year. Like MVP, locals have fought ACP in court for years, but the company is still forging ahead with their plans. Since then, banner drops and other actions in North Carolina have occurred frequently. Unsurprisingly, Dominion (the company behind the ACP) has said they will forge ahead anyway, but this is only the latest in a string of obstacles pipeline companies in the region have faced in court. The fight against the Mountain Valley Pipeline and other oil infrastructure in the region is just the latest to show how determined people are to fight extractive industries in this country, and that the number of them willing to take direct action is spreading every day.

Following months of national opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the Department of the Army ordered an environmental review of the project in December of 2016. The pipeline was originally proposed to cross the Missouri River just above Bismarck, North Dakota, but after complaints, it was rerouted to cross the river along sacred Tribal grounds, less than a mile from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Trump had invested in Energy Transfer, the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. His spokespeople have claimed that he has since divested, but no proof has been presented. Donald Trump has been in office for four days and he's already proving to be the dangerous threat to our climate we feared he would be. But, these pipelines are far from being in the clear. The millions of Americans and hundreds of Tribes that stood up to block them in the first place will not be silenced and will continue fighting these dirty and dangerous projects. Trump claims he's a good businessman, yet he's encouraging dirty, dangerous tar sands development when clean energy is growing faster, producing more jobs and has a real future. Trump claims he cares about the American people, but he's allowing oil companies to steal and threaten their land by constructing dirty and dangerous pipelines through it. Trump claims he wants to protect people's clean air and water, but he's permitting a tar sand superhighway that will endanger both and hasten the climate crisis. The Keystone pipeline was rejected because it was not in the country's interest and the environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline was ordered because of the threats it poses to the Standing Rock Sioux. Nothing has changed. These pipelines were a bad idea then and they're a bad idea now. Simply put, Donald Trump is who we thought he is: a person who will sell off Americans' property and Tribal rights, clean air and safe water to corporate polluters.

A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies.

The hard truth is that pipelines are always and only about politics. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley shake hands during a meeting on Parliament Hill in 2016. The first cross-Canada pipe, the project that gave birth to Trans-Canada Pipeline, helped bring down the Liberal government of Louis St. Laurent in 1957. The infamous Pipeline Debate, ended nearly half a century of Liberal hegemony, and elected John Diefenbaker. The pipeline inquiry, led by Justice Tom Berger, became a multi-year political crusade in defence of First Nations rights, environmental concerns, and was eventually seen as an attack on the oil and gas sector itself. The beautiful full-colour photo laden reports of the Berger Inquiry sold in the thousands. Along the way we then had a series of more short-lived battles over Energy East, Northern Gateway and Keystone XL. Energy East fell victim to politics, most damagingly its poisonous reception by the government of Quebec. Northern Gateway died at the hands of enraged and empowered First Nations, and a series of governments unprepared to take the political risk of defending the transport of heavy oils through the pristine waters surrounding Haida Gwai. Then there is the doubling of the Trans Mountain pipeline. The suffering it has inflicted on politicians in two provinces and prime ministers in two successive governments is without precedent, even in our long painful pipeline history. This was, given our history, a completely predictable 11-hour impasse. The John Horgan government will need to find a face-saving way out, possibly in a spring election. But it is Prime Minister Justin Trudeau who seems likely to be another, almost inevitable, pipeline victim today, like St. Laurent and his father before him.

We lived in it for over 40 years, and though the Vermilion River swelled nearby during heavy rains, I never felt threatened. But times have changed, and after the August floods of 2016 the new owners splashed Facebook with pictures from our flooded living room. If we continue to build pipelines like the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, we risk more floods. The most obvious connection between the Bayou Bridge Pipeline and flooding is that the proposed route is through 600 acres of wetlands. Hurricanes Rita and Katrina painfully taught us the value of wetland protection. We should be building up our wetlands, not building on them. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration further explained the connection between our use of oil and flooding. In a study after the flood, the agency concluded that the warming in our atmosphere made the floods 40 percent more likely. Burning fossil fuels, like oil, warms the atmosphere. When the air is warm, it holds more moisture which causes more rain. The Bayou Bridge Pipeline propels us down a road that no one wants to be on: toward more warming, more destruction of our wetlands, more flooding and more pollution. The National Response Center, the federal point of contact for oil spills, received reports of 144 pipeline accidents in Louisiana in 2016. And those are just the ones that were reported. Cypremort Point, Grand Chenier and the Chandeleur Islands were some of the locations of the spills. This is what happens to our favorite fishing spots. The oil industry minimizes these spills, but supposedly small spills over 65 years have an impact. Oil industry spokespeople claim that the Bayou Bridge Pipeline is the safest way to transport oil, but 144 accidents in a single year speaks for itself. People in Louisiana realize these risks. While Louisiana continues to pursue oil and gas, one of the fastest growing job sectors in the United States is renewable energy. We are laggards missing out on a growing industry as the same old thinking and the greed of a few keeps us locked into oil. The jobs in the renewable energy sector are good, safe jobs that do not require weeks away on a rig. Those who insist on projects like the Bayou Bridge Pipeline are like a man at a poker table who, caught in the adrenaline of the game, bets his home on the next round.

His closest neighbor is the tank farm, a sprawling complex of enormous white steel tanks that are nearly 4 stories tall. Each can hold upwards of a quarter of a million gallons of crude oil. Business had been good on this grey winter day. Somewhere, on the other side of tall security fences, that infamous pipeline will join a busy underground hub. Crude oil already flows into the tank farm through the Keystone, Enbridge and Capline pipelines. The oil leaves through outgoing pipes that transport it north and east to about a dozen refineries in Illinois, Ohio, and West Virginia. One pipeline heads west, to the Phillips 66 facility in Wood River. Thousands of demonstrators joined with the Standing Rock Sioux to protest the location of the pipeline in North Dakota. In September, a small group protested at the tank farm. Loading... But Stover has seen few demonstrators. He says the tank farm has been a good neighbor. I know they maintain it well. Stover has little interaction with the tank farm workers, but at Christmas, they bring over a gift basket. Or, the heavy trucks that rumble past on their way to the tank farm. Shortly after taking office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that lifted a previous order by former President Barack Obama that had called for a review by the Army Corps of Engineers. Construction in North Dakota resumed last week. In Illinois, where the pipeline crosses nearly 180 miles and 12 counties, construction was met with little opposition, though Illinois conservationists have expressed environmental concerns. A report by the nonprofit Prairie Rivers Network, for example, found that the pipeline crosses under more than 50 rivers, big and small, in the state and could put the water supplies of nearby towns at risk should there be a spill. And spills do occur. The village, founded as a railroad town in 1854, has a population of about 560, according to the U.S. Census. Everyone knows everyone. Country singer Drew Baldridge, a rising star in Nashville, was one of 17 graduates in the Class of 2010. He filmed a video in town a few years ago. And the oil companies and their employees contribute time and money to community projects. Once construction is complete, tank farms operate with small workforces. So, many Patoka residents commute to jobs in larger nearby towns, like Vandalia, Salem or Centralia. Like many small rural towns, Patoka has lost population and businesses in recent years, Brumfield said. ADM has a grain elevator in the village. Our grocery stores are gone. We used to have an auto body shop. We used to have pizza places. We had a flower shop. An exception is Foltz Welding, a Patoka business that began in the 1990s. Foltz is a pipeline contractor that builds pump stations and does maintenance work for various pipeline companies. The company works all over the country, but it does not lay pipeline cross-country, said Jeff Lauritzen, operations manager at Foltz. He said his company has built a large portion of the tank farm. Foltz keeps about 50 or 60 people employed, he said, adding that his company employed over 400 people last year, when seasonal and temporary construction workers are included. Tank farms help move the volume of oil that Americans use in products ranging from gasoline to hair products, Lauritzen said. People expect to see lots of farmland in Illinois, so the tank farm is a striking sight, even on a Google satellite map. From the air, the 60 or so tanks look like white buttons on a crazy quilt of corn and soybean fields. According to Genscape, a company that monitors oil inventories, Patoka has a storage capacity of more than 18 million barrels. During World War II, the federal government divided the nation into five Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts, or PADDs. Patoka is the second-largest oil storage site in PADD 2; the largest is Cushing. Well, it helps to know that a century ago, oil was king in Marion County. In January 1938, oil was discovered on the Glenn Merryman farm, a half-mile south of Patoka. Soon there were derricks all over the countryside, and by the end of the year, Illinois was producing 7.5 million barrels of oil. Jim Watson of the Illinois Petroleum Council says that geography had a lot to do with it. You have a major tank farm and switching point in Cushing, Oklahoma. Then you have the one in Patoka. He believes that, because oil was being produced in Marion County, there was already a storage footprint there, and from there the tank farm grew. Treffert lives in Vernon, where the population was 129 in the 2010 census. Lots of grain farming. Your soybeans. Your corn. Some milo. The little park has a life-size statue of a Union Army soldier, playground equipment and picnic benches. From her back door, Treffert has an unobstructed view of the storage tanks, about a half-mile away. People around here, we just sort of stick to ourselves.

Not Jobs or Energy Independence. The Dakota Access Pipeline Will Simply Create Profits. Not Jobs or Energy Independence. You can find new stories here. Profit. By Jonathan Thompson Miles of unused pipe prepared for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline sit in a lot in October 2014 outside Gascoyne, North Dakota. As the weather gets colder, the fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline is heating up, in rather ugly ways. One protester may lose her arm as a result of injuries suffered during the violence. Construction on the pipeline is about 85 percent complete and it has, indeed, put people to work. Yet it is not clear how many new jobs have been created since the jobs are spread out over 1,000 miles. That, in turn, generates sales and lodging tax revenues for the local governments. In a few months, when (and if) construction is complete, the workers and their spending money will depart. The finished pipeline will require just 40 permanent maintenance and operational jobs along its entire stretch. That said, it might be enough to buy the county sheriffs some more military gear from the Pentagon in order to squelch the next pipeline protest. They otherwise go mostly unnoticed until they spill, burst, or explode. The bigger-picture impact, whether on climate change or energy independence, is more difficult to suss out. That is, if you expand pipeline capacity for North Dakota crude, it will encourage more oil drilling and thus more oil production. If more domestic oil is produced, the logic goes, then we have less need to import foreign oil and we achieve greater energy independence. The flip side to that is the more oil we drill, the more we consume, resulting in greater carbon emissions. We can move crude oil not only through pipelines but also with trucks, trains, and tankers. The lack of pipeline capacity is not a major limiting factor in oil development and production; when the North Dakota boom was on, no one opted out of drilling because of a lack of transportation options. In fact, prices were so high, no one opted out of drilling at all. Just as the biggest driver of oil development is a high oil price, the biggest hindrance, particularly for expensive-to-drill North Dakota crude, is a low oil price. That relationship has been on display in North Dakota, and across the West, for the last decade: Oil prices went up, thanks to burgeoning demand in China and the developing world, so drilling intensified and production went bananas. Wells that produced 220 barrels per day when they were drilled in 2005, for example, now only produce about 20 barrels per day. No longer does more pipeline capacity directly lead to more production; it must first either raise the price of oil, or induce demand. A pipeline across the upper Midwest will not inspire the masses in China to buy cars and drive them all over the country. It will not affect global demand. The Dakota Access Pipeline is expected to carry a half-million barrels of oil per day to refineries and market hubs in Illinois. After the last bust, producers and their investors are unlikely to fork out that kind of cash until oil prices go up considerably and stay there, which will only happen if Saudi Arabia commits to a long-term slash in its production. Unless new wells are drilled in North Dakota at a furious rate, production will continue to decrease, thanks to the decline curve. There is one other way the pipeline could impact oil prices, at least for the oil flowing through the line. Some oil customers reportedly entered into contracts with producers prior to construction to buy DAPL oil at or near 2014 prices. If those contracts remain in place despite the protests-caused construction delay, it could, theoretically, push producers to drill a few more wells to produce enough oil to fetch the higher price. But probably not. The glut grows. Prices slide further downward. Production slides. The cycle continues. Therefore, it will not directly lead to a significant increase in carbon emissions. Nor will it get the U.S. any closer to energy independence. The equation that answers that one is far simpler. Yes, Trump is invested in the companies behind the pipeline, though the amount of his stake decreased substantially between 2015 and 2016.

A retired oil refinery employee, MacQueen worked amid risky conditions for more than 20 years, as a pipe fitter and a welder. Eminent domain is often used by governments to gain right-of-way for projects such as highways or government buildings. But state and federal regulators who authorize pipeline projects also typically grant the private companies that are building them the right to use eminent domain to secure needed right-of-way. MacQueen, who voted for President Donald Trump, says he has no problem with the need for pipelines. Trump wooed rural voters by pledging to be attentive to their concerns, but one of his first acts as president was to expedite the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines, both of which have employed eminent domain to secure needed land. And the White House is squarely on the side of pipelines. Unions and industry groups have provided the White House with their favored proposals, which include pipeline projects in Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina and other states, according to documents obtained by McClatchy. Tens of thousands of landowners could soon find themselves in the paths of new pipelines. As of 2016, more than 34,000 miles of new oil and gas pipelines were in the planning stages, according to Pipeline and Gas Journal, an industry trade publication. Many are being spurred by the rich deposits of gas in the Marcellus shale region of West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Lawmakers in some states are pushing back. Georgia and South Carolina recently passed laws banning private companies from using eminent domain for oil pipelines. GOP politicians face a particular conundrum with pipeline proposals. But Republicans are also big supporters of energy interests. In Pennsylvania, Texas, the Dakotas and many other states, the fracking industry and pipelines are seen as major job creators, supported by business groups and construction unions. But the passage of the Georgia and South Carolina laws, he said, shows that a bipartisan coalition is emerging on the issue, making unlikely allies out of environmentalists and tea party activists. EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM Utilities and other pipeline developers gained the ability to use eminent domain during World War II, when oil and natural gas was needed to support the war effort and postwar industrialization. The authorization remained after the war ended. One of the earliest big interstate gas pipelines was financed by a group of wealthy Texans in 1949. The Transco pipeline now stretches from the Gulf of Mexico to New York and is owned by Williams Cos., an Oklahoma-based energy company. More than 15,000 miles of oil and gas pipelines crisscross the United States. Mishaps are rare, they argue. Yet when a pipeline leaks or breaks, the results can be catastrophic. In 2010, eight people died when a Pacific Gas & Electric natural gas pipeline exploded in San Bruno, California. Last year, a man was seriously burned when a gas pipeline owned by a Texas company exploded in Salem Township, Pennsylvania, about 30 miles east of Pittsburgh. Rural landowners often cite such accidents when asked about their pipeline resistance. Sure, they tell us it is safe. Marvin Winstead, owner of a North Carolina farm that a gas pipeline is slated to cross Like many of his neighbors, Winstead has been approached by land agents employed by Dominion, which is partnering with Duke Energy on the 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline. So far, Winstead has refused to sign an easement agreement and is preparing for legal proceedings. Along with safety concerns, she fears the easement could reduce the value of her property in Kenly, North Carolina, which includes her house and a 30-acre family farm. EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM Not all landowners are resisting use of their land for pipelines. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline is expected to cross the farms and yards of some 2,900 property owners in Virginia and North Carolina. Over the last two years, nearly two-thirds of them have signed easement agreements, said Aaron Ruby, a spokesman for Dominion Resources. To highlight some satisfied landowners, the Virginia-based company has produced videos of them. Ruby said there were two primary drivers of the project: abundant gas production in the Marcellus shale, but also regulatory demands that electric utilities retire their coal-fired power plants. The Atlantic Coast Pipeline will allow Dominion and Duke Energy to close several of these plants and replace them with cleaner gas-fired generation stations, he said. Some 80 percent will be used by utilities for electricity generation and the rest will go to natural gas utilities, to supply homes and businesses. Aside from compensating landowners for the use of their property and construction disruptions, Dominion has made 300 adjustments to its planned route, Ruby said. Eminent domain is always an absolute last resort. One of the most controversial is the Mariner East 2, which would add two pipelines along the route of the Mariner East 1 pipeline in the southern part of the state. Sunoco briefly started idling the refinery in 2011. It also knew there was a demand for these liquids in Europe, particularly among plastics manufacturers and gasoline refiners. So the company re-engineered its pipeline to run west to east, and started transferring natural gas liquids to Marcus Hook, where they were being loaded into ships heading to Europe. In Marcus Hook, town leaders are celebrating the project and the jobs it has created. But along the pipeline route, numerous landowners were surprised to learn that a different kind of product was running through their property. Many are just becoming aware that the company is planning to build two new pipelines along that same route, to ship more natural gas liquids overseas. EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM At a recent meeting in Chester County, Pennsylvania, along the pipeline route, more than 100 residents gathered to discuss safety concerns. Several speakers noted that the Mariner East 1 pipeline had been built in the 1930s, when the area had far fewer people. Now there will be two new pipelines, carrying explosive liquids, running within 50 feet of homes and a retirement community, and within a few hundred feet of schools. EDITORS: BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM Sunoco declined requests for a direct interview and would respond only to emailed questions. EDITORS: END OPTIONAL TRIM Although Sunoco says it works to monitor leaks and avoid accidents, Norm MacQueen is dubious. In April of 2015, MacQueen noticed a strange smell wafting through his yard in Edgmont Township, Pennsylvania, where a Sunoco refined-products pipeline is buried. MacQueen contacted Sunoco, and an hour or so later a crew arrived and confirmed the leak. They then brought in extra crews, made a temporary repair to the pipeline and later installed monitoring wells. A year later, Sunoco dispatched a land agent to inform MacQueen about the two new pipelines the company plans to build through his land. Not wanting to go to court, MacQueen and his wife eventually agreed to sign. He said he was far from comfortable with the outcome. The explosion, which burned one person, caused flames to shoot above nearby treetops in the largely rural Salem Township, about 30 miles east of Pittsburgh, and prompted authorities to evacuate businesses nearby. An investigation later cited pipeline corrosion for causing the blast. Kerry Jobe Associated Press Marvin Winstead stands in a field near where the Atlantic Coast Pipeline is slated to go through his farm in Nash County, southwest of Rocky Mount, N.C. The pipeline, a joint venture between Dominion Resources and Duke Energy, is planned to carry natural gas from West Virginia through Virginia into North Carolina. Winstead refuses to sign an easement agreement with the pipeline developers, and he expects that they will use eminent domain to secure land through his farm.

Moving oil by barge or tanker ship can be costly to clean up if something goes wrong and is environmentally unattractive. Pipeline spills cost even less because they are not typically driven miles by wind, and they don't kill clusters of riparian marine life. Pipeline leaks are small, fast to find, and seldom involve a risk to human life. Oil-transportation spills are a fact of life, like traffic accidents. Spills from pipelines are fewer, generally smaller, faster to clean up, and less environmentally damaging than spills from other ways of moving oil. Unlike with those other ways, pipeline leaks rarely catch on fire, and you aren't likely to see a burning pipeline blocking a major highway or threatening a school. We have been hearing a lot about oil-train derailments, crashes, and fires since 2013. According to Forbes, more crude was spilled from rail cars in 2013 than in all the 37 previous years combined. And yet, spectacularly, green and safe projects like the proposed Enbridge Line 3 Replacement Project are being opposed and delayed. A rail tank car carries about 30,000 gallons of oil. A 100-car oil train can deliver about 3 million gallons to a refinery and then return empty to the oil field. That's not a very green process. The Enbridge Line 3 Replacement Project promises to deliver nearly 32 million gallons of oil per day, or 760,000 barrels. Enbridge is a bit generous with its figures. Actually, since both the trains of railcars and the trucks hauling oil need to drive back across the country empty, burning diesel, the Enbridge Line 3 Replacement Project would equal a total of 20,000 rail cars off the road daily or 48,000 tanker trucks daily. That should sound like Christmas every day to every environmentalist. Call your state legislators and tell them we need to hand permits to every responsible, competent company that presents a decent environmental impact statement. Let's start with Enbridge and its Line 3 Replacement Project. And yes, we want the construction jobs. We know they are temporary; but to us, they equal a welcome windfall. And we country folks don't leave money on the table. Terry Stone is a policy analyst and businessman living in International Falls.

Senate Republicans, led by Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley, are trying to ram through the confirmations of as many extreme Trump judicial nominees as they can before the end of the year. Two Trump nominees, Steven Grasz and Mark Norris, with very troubling anti-LGBTQ backgrounds are scheduled for a vote TOMORROW and senators must do everything in their power to stop them. And Mark Norris has a similarly anti-LGBTQ background when he served as a state legislator in Tennessee. And he tried to stop Syrian refugees fleeing violence and war from resettling in Tennessee. All of these actions make it clear that he would not be an unbiased judge that would protect the rights of everyone in Tennessee. Obliterating more than 100 years of Senate traditions, and in the face of his own promises not to do so, he has now scheduled the hearing for judicial nominee David Stras for next Wednesday.

They have built coalitions across movements for tribal sovereignty, defense of natural resources, resistance to expanding energy infrastructure, and cultural survival. They have shown the world a culture grounded in stewardship and connection to Earth. The Standing Rock model of resistance, its Native-led, youth-driven expertise, is moving outward to help other communities protect their land and resources.PHOTO BY MATT HAMON Above, horseback sentinels on the hilltop above the encampments.

In Texas, Frankie Orona, from the Borrado, Chumash, and Tongva people, is leading actions against the Trans-Pecos Pipeline, which will carry fracked gas across Texas and into Mexico, if completed. For months, he and others have danced, prayed, and sang in the path of the line. Recently, they were arrested after locking themselves to construction equipment. One rancher is hosting the camp on her property. Standing Rock has also been evoked in Florida and New Jersey, where Natives and non-Natives have united to object to the Sabal and Pilgrim pipelines, respectively. In Florida, four camps were recently established to protest the Sabal line, and on January 6, Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network went live on Facebook to urge Standing Rock water protectors to go support these other fights. Elsewhere, Native people are standing up for mountains. Prayer gatherings, blockades, arrests, declarations of Native self-determination, and a lawsuit have blocked the project so far. In Arizona, longtime protests have also sought to roll back desecration of Mount Graham, where a telescope mars the sacred summit, and the San Francisco Peaks, contaminated by wastewater that a ski area uses for snow-making. Certainly the Standing Rock campaign has inspired wider interest in Native struggles, agrees Judith LeBlanc, director of the Native Organizers Alliance and member of the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma. And she is optimistic. Chief Arvol Looking Horse, 19th Generation Keeper of the Sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe, spiritual leader of the of the Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota Nations.

He did the same for 1.35 million acres in southern Utah, now the Bear Ears National Monument. Notably, at Bear Ears indigenous people will contribute to ongoing management decisions. Though state and congressional officials have said they will fight both monument designations, such actions are difficult to unwind. Native-led campaigns take place in courtrooms, legislatures, and other government chambers. They also occur during face-offs on the prairie, desert, and tundra. By the end of November 2016, more than 300 tribes were represented at the Standing Rock camps. Back home, each tribe faces its own struggle against government and industry, with decades of destruction and injustice behind and years of fighting ahead. Indian Country in America Before there were states, there was Indian Country. Click on the points on the map below to explore seven stories of Native resistance. Source: US Census Bureau Great Lakes, MichiganSault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, in Michigan, described aging, mussel-encrusted pipelines carrying 540,000 barrels of oil and natural gas daily through the Straits of Mackinac in the Great Lakes. The protests at Standing Rock have called attention to the proliferation of new pipelines, but old ones found all over the country are also very dangerous, according to Kay. The resource threatened in her area is massive. Lying on the lake bottom are twin pipelines dating to the 1950s. Of the more than 4,000 significant incidents reported to PHMSA over six years, detection equipment recognized less than 10 percent, while the general public and techniques like ground and aerial patrols spotted the rest. The damage would be to lifeways as well as to economies, adds Kay. Some may think of treaties as dusty documents that are no longer relevant. Not so, says Indian law attorney Rollie Wilson, with Fredericks Peebles & Morgan. Regardless, treaty rights are legally binding, as has been shown repeatedly in court, says Wilson. Memories of the Kalamazoo River accident are still fresh in the area. When the Michigan Petroleum Pipeline Task Force asked for public input for its 2015 report on Enbridge Line 5, the consensus was clear. Most respondents said to shut it down. That would presumably prevent what happened during the Kalamazoo River accident, when an Enbridge employee misread the signals and pumped even more oil through the broken Line 5, worsening the spill. The company has resisted replacing the line. The task force report casts doubt on this rosy assessment, noting that Enbridge makes public only its inspection conclusions, not its data. The state task force is studying alternatives for the line, ranging from no change to replacing it to transporting its products by another method altogether. As this process inches forward, Kay continues to worry. Every day that Enbridge Line 5 remains in use is one day closer to disaster, she says. Oak Flat, ArizonaSan Carlos Apache Nation Sacred lands of the San Carlos Apache sit on the largest untapped copper deposit on the continent. Resolution Copper Co. plans to extract the ore by blasting it from below and mining in through tunnels underground. Once the ore is removed, the earth above it will sink and create a crater nearly 1,000 feet deep and a mile across. These teachings go back to the beginning and have been passed from generation to generation, from family to family. The Apache Stronghold movement he leads is an effort to save Oak Flat, an Apache sacred landscape in Arizona. Before Standing Rock, there was Oak Flat. Like Standing Rock, the encampment at Oak Flat is remote. Yet members from outside tribes, representatives from national and regional tribal coalitions, and non-Native supporters, including members of environmental and religious groups, have shown up in droves. The press coverage, in turn, has kept alive public interest in protecting the sacred place. The Oak Flat controversy exploded in December 2014, when the Arizona congressional delegation slipped a land swap into the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2015. The measure privatized a 2,400-acre traditional cultural landscape in the Tonto National Forest that has been revered by Apaches and other tribes since time immemorial. It then gave the tract to Resolution Copper Mining in return for approximately 5,000 acres of company land. To protect the site, Arizona Representative Raul Grijalva plans to resubmit the Save Oak Flat Act in the current congressional session, according to Adam Sarvana, communications director for Democrats on the House Natural Resources Committee. The act would strip the land swap out of the defense authorization, leaving the rest of the bill intact. In another step forward, Oak Flat made it onto the National Register of Historic Places in March last year. This does not afford permanent protection but adds requirements to an already-detailed environmental review that is in the initial stages. But he and his allies are taking no chances. Tosawihi, NevadaWestern Shoshone Nation Joseph Holley of the Battle Mountain Band of the Te-Moak Western Shoshone surveys the land with his grandson, Julius. Holley's band has taken the lead in protecting the Tosawihi Quarries, a tribal sacred site in north-central Nevada, from destruction by gold mining. His people hunted deer, rabbits, and other game and gathered wild onions and carrots and additional edibles. When the rabbit brush turned yellow in the fall, they trekked to forested mountains to pick pine nuts, a dietary staple they would roast and store for later use. The stone has properties that assist traditional healers to this day. In the mid-19th century, silver and other valuable minerals were discovered in what, in 1864, would become the state of Nevada. The 1872 General Mining Law made it cheap and easy to stake out claims, driving up the population of settlers. To this day, a few hundred dollars will establish and hold a claim on public land that can be mined, with no royalties due to the federal government, unlike other extractive industries. It remains a bone of contention with the federal government. The valley where the Western Shoshones are camped seems idyllic and untouched, but a foray out of it reveals much damage to the surrounding landscape. A horizontal cut scars the face of a hill used for eons for vision quests. The gouge was bulldozed during construction of a power line to support increased production at the gold mine that has taken a giant bite out of nearby hillsides. The power line also wiped out a centuries-old trail, where an ancestral healer walked, sang, and picked medicinal plants. People who needed care would hear his song and follow him. Murray Sope (left) and Joseph Holley (right) help Reginald Sope, a healer from the Shoshone-Paiute Tribe, place tarps over a ceremonial sweat-lodge frame in Tosawihi. Photo by Joseph Zummo Tosawihi sits on federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). As such, national preservation and environmental laws protect Tosawihi. Portions of it have been determined eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. Tribal members claim that damage to Tosawihi could be avoided or minimized if the BLM followed federal law. The agency has commissioned archaeological studies that have identified scattered locations on the landscape that can be considered for preservation under the law, while the rest may be subjected to mining-related destruction. Tribal attorney Rollie Wilson says this reaction is typical and unfortunate. Joseph Holley, former chairman and now councilman of the Battle Mountain Band of the Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone, learned about protecting tribal resources from watching his elders, and now his young grandsons stick close by, watching and learning. As Holley walks around Tosawihi with the youngsters, Julius Holley finds an arrowhead made by a tribal forebear. He picks it up. A past of deep antiquity is vital and tangible in his young life. Salmon and the lives and livelihoods that depend on it are at risk from the proposed Pebble Mine upstream and east of Bristol Bay. The fishery also supports Alaska Native subsistence lifeways and cultures. Williams says that when opposition to Pebble Mine gathered steam in 2004, tribal members realized they needed to learn how to effectively combat the project. The environmental nonprofit Earthworks helped Williams and other tribal members reach out to Western Shoshones to learn about modern large-scale mining. Groups ranging in size from about eight to 15 and representing tribal communities around the bay traveled to Nevada starting in 2008; in 2012, a group visited Wendsler Nosie Sr. in Oak Flat, says Bonnie Gestring, an Earthworks staffer who accompanied the Alaskans. In Nevada, the Alaska Natives toured mines and did flyovers. The answer was generally no, she reports. The environmental impacts are crushing, the visitors to Nevada learned; moreover, modern-day mining is highly technical, with few jobs for local people seeking to break into the industry. In early 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report showing that building and operating Pebble Mine would likely damage the now-pristine Bristol Bay watershed. This would, in turn, reduce salmon habitat and affect additional fish and animal populations. Some families who own commercial boats have been coming here for 100 years; they get the importance of salmon. Sport fishermen who have waited their whole lives to get a 50-pound king salmon understand. We Native people understand, of course. This community support distinguishes the Bristol Bay movement from the one at Standing Rock, where much of the non-Native community does not support the tribe, observes Daniel Cheyette, attorney for Bristol Bay Native Corporation, the economic arm of tribes in the region. The lawsuit is ongoing. As at Tosawihi, Standing Rock, and other sites of Native resistance, the struggle involves young people working alongside their elders. Tribal members as young as 13 testified before the EPA when it was gathering information for its 2014 report, Williams says. The tribal consortium she heads advocates for the protection of the Yup'ik, Dena'ina, and Alutiiq way of life in Bristol Bay. The important role Native youth play is evident all around Indian Country, says Nosie, of Oak Flat. Thurston County, NebraskaOmaha Tribe of Nebraska After a devastating U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-induced dam release in 2011, the Missouri River flooded the Omaha Tribe's lands and casino, shown here, leaving many poverty-striken members homeless and jobless. Among the farms, towns, and other entities downriver was the small, impoverished Omaha Tribe, where unemployment has hovered at about the 80 percent mark and a casino has been a major source of both revenue for the tribe and jobs for the few tribal members who have them. Since the mid-20th century, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has used dams large and small to reengineer the mighty Missouri and its tributaries. At first, the idea was to prevent flooding and facilitate navigation while providing electricity. Recent modifications include artificial sandbars to slow the river and make it more hospitable to recreation and wildlife. In 2011, it was clear that the now-man-made waterway had become a fearsome Franken-river that its creator and master, the Corps, could no longer control. The damage up and down the river was disastrous. The suit was filed on behalf of nearly 400 plaintiffs, including the Omaha Tribe and farmers and businesses in five states the Missouri River traverses. Tribes are sovereign nations with government-to-government relationships with the United States. By law, federal agencies must consult with them when agency actions and policies would likely impact tribal resources. However, agencies are not necessarily cooperative. Questions about whether the Standing Rock Sioux were properly consulted during decision-making for the Dakota Access Pipeline precipitated the gatherings. HISTORICAL PHOTO FROM THE OMAHA TRIBE OF NEBRASKA The Corps also failed to meaningfully assist the Omaha Tribe once it was clear they were facing a catastrophe. According to Corps spokesperson Eugene Pawlik, the agency is unable to respond to questions or provide comments because of the ongoing litigation. Over the next several weeks, the community mobilized, with tribal employees and volunteers digging up land from elsewhere on the reservation and creating a berm to try to stem the flood. Despite their efforts, their homeland was inundated, including the casino and, with it, a financial mainstay. Destruction of farmland leased out for additional income meant more economic devastation. Tradition sustained a blow as well since the flood damaged culturally important places. Since the flood, our elders go to pray at holy places, then leave. When a community is so vulnerable, recovery takes a long time. With tribal and federal money, a new casino has been built on a higher foundation that should keep it above future flooding, according to Johnson. However, some land is lost forever as an income generator. As tough as the economic losses have been, the devastation of cultural places has been far worse, Johnson says. Miller implored the federal officials at the consultation meetings to learn from these mistakes. Their decisions have huge impacts on tribal communities, he said, and consultations must be person-to-person, as well as government-to-government. A phone call or a letter warning of impending disaster is not enough, said Miller: Respect for tribal sovereignty demands more from the federal consultation process. Nearly one-quarter of them are on Indian reservations, according to Indian Country Today Media Network, meaning that about 1 percent of the U.S. population sustains 25 percent of the environmental and related cultural damage. The San Juan River, which pours down into the Navajo reservation from the Rocky Mountains, turned a ghastly orange on August 5, 2015. This occurred as a result of EPA activities at the Gold King Mine in Colorado. The mine is one of many abandoned operations sitting by creeks whose waters eventually end up in the San Juan. While attempting to draw off contaminated water, EPA-hired construction crews with heavy equipment triggered the collapse of a portion of the mine and a three-million-gallon blowout of toxic sludge laced with lead, mercury, and other heavy metals. Tribal member Mark Maryboy lives in Montezuma Creek, Utah, a tiny Navajo-reservation village on the San Juan River. The waters of the Animas River, a tributary of the San Juan River, ran orange within 24 hours of the spill in southwestern Colorado. Tribal members worry about health consequences, and ceremonies that use sand and water from the river and pollen from once productive cornfields have been interrupted, says the Navajo brief. Tourists have stayed away, causing more economic pain. She reminded the EPA that the federal government holds Native lands in trust for tribes and their members and, as the trustee, has obligations to protect Native land and natural resources. The Justice Department, which will defend the EPA, has not yet responded to the complaint, according to attorney Moez Kaba, who is part of the team representing the Navajo Nation. Resource extraction is rarely advantageous for anyone outside the corporations that own the mines and oil wells, Maryboy says. Navajos worked in the mines for four decades without safety gear; then, once the mines were closed, it took nearly three decades more for the EPA to begin removing the toxins. The agency started with a small program in 2008 and recently began a one-billion-dollar cleanup, funded by a settlement with the mine operator. The corporation has been trying to identify a spring where it could draw off and bottle water that would be sold at a premium because of its pristine origins. The company claimed it had done hydrological, air quality, and other studies and found the project would be sustainable and have little environmental impact. After a severe drought heightened local fears about selling off water, residents of the surrounding county, including the tribal members, mobilized. They held rallies and wrote a ballot measure that would make it illegal to bottle water in the county. They knocked on doors and attended events to gather support for the measure. The Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs chimed in, decrying the bottling project, saying it had moved forward without proper tribal consultation and public review. Warm Springs tribal member Annie Leonard fasted. No one is signing onto anything. The tribes are standing fast. Again, youth are important to the effort. And Native people must safeguard the water, Miller adds, echoing the language that came out of Standing Rock and reverberates throughout Indian Country.

The Kinder Morgan pipeline was not built after a public outcry. The Kinder Morgan pipeline was not built after a public outcry. It was found by an ordinary citizen who noticed dead vegetation and the powerful smell of gasoline in a rural Upstate community two years ago. The ability of a private oil pipeline company to condemn land for a new project is a particular sore spot with property rights advocates, forest companies, environmentalists and some state legislators. During testimony Wednesday, they questioned why for-profit oil companies have the right to condemn land without showing a public need. Pipeline companies say they prefer not to condemn land. The committee that heard testimony includes state lawmakers, oil pipeline interests and state regulators. A state law approved last spring requires the committee to study whether South Carolina needs tighter controls on pipeline companies and to report its findings to the Legislature. The state has two major oil pipelines running through the foothills near Anderson and Greenville. After Kinder Morgan proposed its new pipeline through South Carolina and Georgia, Palmetto State lawmakers banned oil pipeline companies from condemning land for three years. As early as next summer, the study committee will recommend to lawmakers what should be done. Petroleum pipelines have stirred passions in communities across the country, with many people complaining that the lines are intrusive and a source of pollution. Closer to South Carolina, Colonial has drawn fire recently over two pipeline breaks in Alabama, including one that caused an explosion. That power generally is reserved for governments or entities that need property for a public use, such as a road. She urged the committee to recommend a permanent ban on eminent domain by for-profit companies. Holleman, of the Southern Environmental Law Center, said there is no need for pipeline companies to retain the power of eminent domain for new lines. Research his group has conducted shows that pollution levels actually are increasing in spots. Benzene, a cancer-causing material, for instance, reached 7,850 parts per billion in one place in September. Of the nearly 370,000 gallons that spilled, at least 160,000 gallons still have not been cleaned up from the property in rural Anderson County, he said. Creeks and groundwater are suffering, he said. Holleman criticized the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control for failing to require a more aggressive cleanup plan. His organization has filed formal comments with DHEC to complain about the plan."}, {"URL": "http://www.environmentalhealthnews.org/t/8537843466109310477", "Timestamp": "20180918231929", "Sentences": "5h After Florence, some homebound seniors running out of food and water Wilmington, North Carolina, remains mostly cut off and that's making it difficult for some residents to get supplies. 5h The Ocean Cleanup launches System 001 Boyan Slat, the 24-year-old founder and CEO of the Ocean Cleanup, has finally launched a system he says will rid the Great Pacific Garbage Patch of half its plastic trash in five years. 6h A year after Hurricane Maria, Puerto Ricans rebuild amid setbacks For many, the recovery after the deadly, devastating storm has been agonizingly slow.

Blood samples were taken from each of the 16 participants both after they drank a cocktail containing BPA and at a separate visit, after they drank an identical cocktail that did not contain BPA. And participants who already had relatively poor blood sugar control seemed more sensitive to BPA's effects. In late pregnancy, hormonal changes are believed to push a woman into a temporary state of insulin resistance in order to ensure enough sugar gets across the placenta to her rapidly growing fetus. The authors posed the possibility that BPA, if mistaken for a steroid by the body, could trigger similar effects.

By that time, it had spread an astonishing 5.4 miles away from the original site of the leak. In fact, it is still unclear as to what caused the pipeline to leak in the first place. It is now known, however, that the leak happened on December 5, which means the oil spill has continued unabated for quite some time now. By now it should be crystal clear to all that those at Standing Rock do indeed have just cause for concern over their fears of the Dakota Access Pipeline, especially in light of these recent events. The Spill Investigation Program Manager for the North Dakota Department of Health, Bill Suess, has said that whenever oil leaks into water it is considered a very serious matter and is something that is thoroughly investigated. With this recent oil leak that spilled into a nearby creek and countryside grounds, you can well imagine that building another line directly beneath the Missouri River could only be fraught with peril. And when that location just happens to be right next to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where it could affect drinking water, it is only going to be a recipe for disaster. Pipeline 150 miles from Dakota Access protests leaks 176,000 gallons of oil. In a strange twist of fate, on the exact day that the permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline was stricken down, this recent oil spill in Billings County was also discovered. Oil leaks take an incredibly long time to clean up. Even now that the recent oil leak from the Belle Fourche Pipeline has been contained, it will still take awhile to continue the clean up process, as Bill Suess affirms. Even the electronic monitoring equipment that should have alerted the pipeline owners to the mess near Standing Rock failed to do its job. But even with technology, oil spills happen much more frequently than you might think. Since 2006, they have had 30 leaks. In fact, one of their pipelines even dumped 30,000 gallons of oil straight into Yellowstone River. Because of this, a town of 6,000 people had their drinking water service totally shut down. To put this all into perspective, the company that would have operated the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock reservation, Sunoco Logistics, has more oil spills than any of its competitors as Reuters has reported. Since 2010 they have had more than 200 leaks. While the December 5 oil spill in Billings County is a tragedy of epic proportions, both for the land and the wildlife that have been lost, it is a harsh reminder that we need to be very careful where we build pipelines. Thankfully, the brave souls that protested at Standing Rock have made their point, and Standing Rock appears, for the time being at least, to be safe."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/265915762t?referring_akid=.3542825.-ofWhT", "Timestamp": "20180918223553", "Sentences": "Credo Action Stop Trump from building the Dakota Access pipeline.

The estimate of when gas started leaking into winter habitat for the endangered Cook Inlet beluga whales was issued in a proposed safety order last week by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration that the agency confirmed on Tuesday. A Hilcorp helicopter crew Feb. 7 spotted gas bubbling to the surface about four miles off shore. However, the company in late January reported that it had detected increased gas flow through the pipeline in January and started looking for a leak, according pipeline safety office's report. A subsequent analysis of gas flow indicated the pipeline likely began leaking in December, the agency said. The agency late Friday issued the proposed safety order requiring the line to be repaired by May 1 or shut down. Hilcorp has 30 days to respond. In a statement Tuesday afternoon, company spokeswoman Lori Nelson said the safety of response personnel is the company's top priority. She said Hilcorp is pleased that the proposed safety order recognizes that immediate repair is not viable. The pipeline is in 80 feet of water. Repairs by divers cannot be made in current winter conditions that include sea ice, severe weather and extreme tides, according to Hilcorp. The company told the federal pipeline office safe diving operations cannot start until late March at the earliest. Shutting the gas pipeline down is not an option, Hilcorp said. Before the pipeline carried natural gas, it moved crude oil. Without pressure in the line, seawater could enter and allow residual crude oil to leak, the company said. Hilcorp purchased the pipeline and other oil and gas facilities from XTO Energy, Inc., in September 2015. The 8-inch line also leaked in June and August 2014. The leaks were 42 yards apart about two-thirds of a mile from the current leak. They were repaired with clamps. XTO Energy concluded that previous leaks were caused by rocks contacting the pipe in locations where the line was not continuously supported by seabed. Annual side-scan sonar or multi-beam echo-sounder surveys conducted by the company do not detect external loads on the pipe, eroded pipe, rock impingements, metal loss, dings or gouges, the federal pipeline office said. The agency called for creating modifications to the pipe to allow in-line inspections or alternative technologies. Besides endangered beluga whales, Cook Inlet is home to salmon and other fish. Hilcorp last week said its modeling consultants conclude that only tiny amounts of natural gas likely are dissolving into the water. The company said Tuesday that based on observations so far, the natural gas release does not pose a threat to the public or the environment. In a letter Tuesday to the Trump administration, however, seven environmental groups strongly disagreed. They called for the federal pipeline safety office to issue an emergency order shutting down the line. The leak is creating a low-oxygen dead zone that threatens belugas and other wildlife, the groups said. Her group is one of two that have given formal notice that they intend to sue Hilcorp Alaska over the leak. Hilcorp faces issues elsewhere in Alaska. The commission said the company without authorization used nitrogen to clean a well. Hilcorp in a statement said it has taken steps to make sure similar incidents don't happen in the future."}, {"URL": "http://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/saskatchewan-water-protectors-refuse-to-be-silent/", "Timestamp": "20180919004931", "Sentences": "Kerry Benjoe, Regina Leader-Post Updated: January 27, 2017 Two women hold protest signs referring to the Dakota Access and Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain oil pipeline projects as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau makes his way through the crowds at the University of Regina on Jan. 26, 2017.

That trade represented 76 per cent of our exports and 20 per cent of our GDP last year. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau now claims he takes seriously the need to diversify our trading markets, yet he gives short shrift to the most effective way to achieve that objective. It would be faster, more certain and cost the government nothing if it simply liberated the private sector to invest capital, foster trade and pay more of the royalties and taxes that fund our critical social programs. Furthermore, despite all the fear-mongering about apocalyptic global warming, the government will not meet its Paris climate accord commitments and cannot even marginally reduce global temperatures without sending Canada back to the Stone Age. Trudeau claims he takes seriously the need to diversify our trading markets, yet he gives short shrift to the most effective way to achieve that objective We will soon see whether the new minister of natural resources, Amarjeet Sohi, does his job and responsibly promotes the resource sector or, like his predecessor, willingly succumbs to the anti-development zealots in cabinet and the PMO. His first task should be to fundamentally revise the Impact Assessment Act, which creates so much risk and cost that no new major private-sector pipeline is likely to ever be built in Canada as long as the act remains. A failure to fix this problem would be proof positive the Liberal government intends to strand much of our vast resource wealth in pursuit of its unattainable green objectives. I doubt that Sohi will take up the fight for fossil fuels, but would love to be proven wrong. The federal government is not alone in sacrificing our resource exports on the altar of environmental delusions. Several provinces are doing the same. Needless to say, this is devastating for the natural gas industry and its workers in Quebec. In sharp contrast, America has become the largest producer of oil and gas in the world, largely due to fracking, with immense advantages for economic growth, jobs, its standard of living and national security. Western Canadians also benefitted enormously from using fracking technology safely for over 60 years. It perfectly meets the definition of bad policy: One that is costly and undercuts its stated objective. But today there are new realities that have made that approach even more harmful to our national well-being, as Canada contends with a trade-fighting American president and signs of slower economic growth.

The 306-mile pipeline project would carry 275,000 barrels a day of butane, propane and other liquid fossil fuels from Ohio and West Virginia to the Atlantic coast for export. Construction has been plagued by numerous spills and contaminated drinking water supplies for homes in Silver Lake Township, Pennsylvania. The only activities allowed will be those associated with ensuring the shutdown is done safely and without further environmental damage. Patrick McDonnell said in a statement announcing the order. Pipeline opponents called on the department to go further. A May Food & Water Watch report called attention to the role that Mariner East II would play in efforts to convert ethane from fracked gas wells into a new glut of plastics, citing the health hazards for workers and communities near petrochemical manufacturing, as well as the growing plastics gyres in the Pacific Ocean. More directly, Sunoco has a checkered record nationwide when it comes to hazardous materials pipeline spills. This is not the first time Mariner East II has been halted. Last summer, a Pennsylvania court ordered Mariner East II construction temporarily suspended following numerous objections, until Sunoco agreed to stronger project oversight from the state. Energy Transfer Partners, parent company of Sunoco Pipeline, said that it did not plan to abandon construction efforts. Still, there are signs that investors are growing frustrated with delays. The project's permits originally anticipated that construction would be done by 2016. This fall, Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren told investors during an earnings call that it might try to bring in a joint venture partner to help carry the costs. Pipeline opponents say that the risks won't end after construction is over, citing safety concerns associated with the liquid fuels Mariner East II will carry very close to schools, senior homes and businesses through the densely populated suburbs of Philadelphia. An analysis by FracTracker found that over 100,000 people live within a quarter mile of Mariner East II's proposed path. A worst-case scenario explosion could bring a fireball with an even larger radius, a study by commissioned by a local safety coalition found last year, prompting one school to start conducting safety drills. That's in addition to the environmental concerns associated with the problem-plagued construction. Public safety advocates said that they considered Wednesday's order a partial victory. Other grassroots activists have staged tree sits and other protests to halt Mariner East II's construction at a Camp White Pine in Huntington County. Elise Gerhart and her mother Ellen, a retired public school teacher, have said the company attempted to illegally cut trees on their land to clear the pipeline's path. Given the company's record, she questioned whether Sunoco would adequately follow the DEP order's new requirements. Reposted with permission from our media associate DeSmogBlog.

A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies.

The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants.

They are concerned the 69-mile pipeline may be expanded or the amount of oil that flows through it may be increased. They are also worried about plans to expand the larger Trans Mountain Pipeline that runs through Canada and connects with the local pipeline. The Canadian government announced May 29 plans to purchase the Trans Mountain Pipeline system from Kinder Morgan to ensure completion of the planned expansion. That system includes the Puget Sound Pipeline spur. Those four refineries currently receive more than half the oil sent through the Trans Mountain Pipeline across Alberta and British Columbia, according to Kinder Morgan documents. While the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion plan focuses on construction in Alberta and British Columbia, the potential to expand the Puget Sound Pipeline as well is penciled into some Kinder Morgan documents. Local refineries have not said whether the planned Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion or a potential Puget Sound Pipeline expansion would impact them. The Andeavor Anacortes Refinery did not respond to a request for comment. A document filed Feb. 20 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission states that although Kinder Morgan does not have plans to expand the Puget Sound Pipeline, its capacity could be increased from 240,000 to 500,000 barrels per day. In recent years, the pipeline has operated below capacity. Between 2015 and 2017, it moved an average of 180,000 barrels per day to the refineries in Whatcom and Skagit counties, according to Kinder Morgan documents. No plans to expand While there are no current plans to expand the local pipeline, Liestman and several other representatives of environmental organizations and indigenous communities who spoke Thursday said they have concerns about the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion and what it would mean for Washington. Their primary concerns are that the planned expansion would increase tanker traffic in the Salish Sea and increase the amount of oil that would be exported overseas, burned and contribute to climate change. According to Kinder Morgan, the expansion would include building a second pipeline alongside the existing Trans Mountain route between Edmonton, Alberta, and Burnaby, British Columbia. A marine port in Burnaby, near Vancouver, would also be expanded in order to ship more oil overseas, according to Kinder Morgan documents. The Associated Press reported that the number of oil tankers moving oil from Alberta through the Salish Sea would increase from 60 to 400 as a result of the pipeline expansion. Washington Gov. Tribal and environmental leaders in Washington, along with First Nations and environmental leaders in British Columbia, have spoken out against and protested the expansion plans for several years.

CreditA. President Trump, of course, has since reversed course. And now Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, a leader on efforts to address climate change, is sticking up for pipelines. In a move that put him at odds with many voters in his Liberal Party, Mr. Trudeau said that the government would buy the Trans Mountain pipeline, which links Edmonton to suburban Vancouver, from its American owners for 4.5 billion Canadian dollars. The reason: to make sure that workers can begin threading a second pipeline along its length this month. Nationalism and using public money to help a private business venture were the points of contention. The volume rose and tensions flared in the House of Commons. Then the Liberals, with an anxious eye on their construction deadline, used a ham-handed parliamentary procedure to shut down debate and force a vote. But demonstrations against the purchase started in British Columbia just hours after the announcement. Mr. Trudeau appears to be gambling on the notion that most Canadians sit somewhere in the middle, and like him believe that Canada can balance environmental protection and a strong energy industry. After we talked about that, most of the people I met brought up the pipeline. Mr. Trudeau may now be facing his greatest political sales job.

Share share tweet comment email Pulling oil from the tar sands of Canada is an ugly business. It scars the land with deep gashes, barren pits, and murky tailing ponds. It can be hard to grasp the scale of it from the ground, so photographer Stuart Hall rented a plane. What he saw stunned him. Tar sands contain bitumen, a dense, highly viscous substance refined into oil, and Alberta sits on a deposit the size of New York. It supplies half of the oil that flows into the US from Canada, the nation's biggest supplier of foreign oil. The impact of all that mining fascinated Hall, a photographer who grew up in a coal mining family in Nottinghamshire, England. When he read about the massive sands six years ago, he knew it would be his next project. He spent a week at Fort McMurray in November, 2011, the hub of Alberta's mining industry. The city sits on the Athabasca tar sands, the world's largest known deposit of bitumen. Some of the bitumen lies 250 feet underground and is removed with earth-moving equipment and enormous trucks. But most of it is deep enough to require injecting steam to heat the bitumen so it can be pumped to the surface. Hall shot Giga Project during three week-long visits over three years. He had hoped to shoot from the ground, but found the worksites hidden by barriers and roadblocks. So he overcame his apprehension for flying and chartered a plane. He vividly remembers seeing the mines from 5,000 feet. The Athabasca deposit lies beneath a boreal forest and peat bogs, but you'd never know it from Hall's gritty photos. The landscape is stripped of color and texture, leaving a vast expanse of gray and black dotted by enormous machines. Renting a plane is expensive, so Hall had to table the project for now. He hopes to return later this year to photograph workers on the ground. Hall insists he isn't trying to be political, but his photos nevertheless make you examine the ugly cost of society's insatiable thirst for oil. All rights reserved. Your California Privacy Rights.

The expert panel on the NEB commissioned by the Trudeau government made this point. No, said the NEB. In the NEB Kinder Morgan hearings, the largest union in the oilsands, Unifor, intervened. You might be forgiven for assuming that a union, interested in jobs, intervened to ensure Kinder Morgan got built. You would be wrong. Unifor attempted to enter evidence that building Kinder Morgan would cost jobs. The Alberta Federation of Labour represents 170,000 workers in Alberta. Shipping out unprocessed solid bitumen to refineries in other countries ships out Canadian jobs at the same time. And it increases the carbon footprint of the product. In 1953, when the Trans Mountain pipeline was first built, it was not for export. It shipped crude to four refineries on the Lower Mainland. Shipping solid bitumen diluted with toxic fossil-fuel condensate for export bypasses the last remaining refinery. That refinery cannot process bitumen. It has already cut its workforce by 30 per cent, and if Kinder Morgan goes ahead, it will likely close. The NEB refused to accept the evidence. It ruled that its mandate did not include jobs, or climate, or upstream or downstream impacts. The claim that the Kinder Morgan expansion would create 15,000 jobs is thrown around in the cloud of confetti. B.C. economist Robyn Allan went on a quest for the source of the claim. The more realistic figure is less than 20 per cent that size. There is no technology to clean up a dilbit spill. NRCan studies are also in tanks in Alberta. What DFO found in real-world conditions is that the diluent separated from the bitumen and the bitumen formed oil balls around bits of sand and sediment and sank. By all means, let Kinder Morgan spill its dilbit in tanks of water in Alberta. But it must not put our marine environment at risk. Certainly, creating a petulant trade spat between provinces is not. Ignoring Indigenous rights is not. We need an energy policy that puts energy security, jobs and climate action as shared goals. Build upgraders and refineries in Alberta, sell finished product across Canada; end the import of foreign oil; and plan for an orderly phase-out of fossil fuels. Decades from now, we might realize that a molecule of carbon is more valuable for petrochemicals than for burning.

Wheat farmer and cattle rancher Steve Pope told local TV station KFOR that he has lost an estimated 120 acres of pasture and wheat crop from the spill. We are following our emergency response plan, and our staff is working with regulators and affected landowners. Our current priorities are to ensure the safety of all involved and limit the environmental impact of the release. The oil spill happened less than 1,000 feet from the nearby Cooper Creek, which feeds into the Cimarron River, but the spill was contained on Pope's fields. Cleanup is underway at the site of the leak. Pope expressed concerns about the damage from the spill as well as President Trump's proposed budget cuts to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), now led by former Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt. Plains All American Pipeline is one of the largest energy companies in the country with an extensive energy infrastructure in the United States and Canada. The company says it handles an average of 4.6 million barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids in its transportation segment. But the company has had a long history of pipeline issues, KFOR pointed out. Citing data from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline & Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, the oil company was behind more than 25 pipeline incidents in the state of Oklahoma since 2006, with 14 incidents listing corrosion as a cause and six due to material, welding or equipment failures. Al Jazeera detailed the company's extensive history safety and environmental violations in other states, including its citation for 10 oil spills that violated the Clean Water Act in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Kansas. Last year, Plains was also indicted for a major May 2015 spill that spewed 140,000 gallons of crude oil near Santa Barbara, California that fouled miles of shoreline and killed hundreds of seabirds and marine animals.

We explain how pipelines fail. 911 received an urgent call. A gas station had just exploded and a fire with flames reaching 300 feet was raging through the neighborhood. The explosion was so large that residents suspected an airplane crash. But the real culprit was found underground: a ruptured pipeline spewing natural gas caused a blast that left behind a 72 foot long crater, killed eight people, and injured more than fifty. Over 2,000 miles away in Michigan, workers were still cleaning up another pipeline accident, which spilled 840,000 gallons of crude oil into the Kalamazoo River in 2010. As Obama begins his second term he will likely make a key decision on the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, a proposed pipeline extension to transport crude from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Construction on the southern route is already underway, sparking fierce opposition from some landowners and environmentalists. The problem, protesters say, is that any route will pose hazards to the public. While pipeline operator TransCanada has declared that Keystone will be the safest pipeline ever built in North America, critics are skeptical. Critics of the Keystone proposal point to the hundreds of pipeline accidents that occur every year. They charge that system wide, antiquated pipes, minimal oversight and inadequate precautions put the public and the environment at increasing risk. Pipeline operators point to billions of dollars spent on new technologies and a gradual improvement over the last two decades as proof of their commitment to safety. Pipelines are generally regarded as a safe way to transport fuel, a far better alternative to tanker trucks or freight trains. The risks inherent in transporting fuel through pipelines are analogous to the risks inherent in traveling by airplane. Airplanes are safer than cars, which kill about 70 times as many people a year (highway accidents killed about 33,000 people in 2010, while aviation accidents killed 472). But when an airplane crashes, it is much more deadly than any single car accident, demands much more attention, and initiates large investigations to determine precisely what went wrong. The same holds true for pipelines. Based on fatality statistics from 2005 through 2009, oil pipelines are roughly 70 times as safe as trucks, which killed four times as many people during those years, despite transporting only a tiny fraction of fuel shipments. But when a pipeline does fail, the consequences can be catastrophic (though typically less so than airplane accidents), with the very deadliest accidents garnering media attention and sometimes leading to a federal investigation. While both air travel and pipelines are safer than their road alternatives, the analogy only extends so far. Airplanes are replaced routinely and older equipment is monitored regularly for airworthiness and replaced when it reaches its safety limits. And while airplanes have strict and uniform regulations and safety protocols put forth by the Federal Aviation Administration, such a uniform set of standards does not exist for pipelines. In many cases, critics argue, pipeline accidents could have been prevented with proper regulation from the government and increased safety measures by the industry. As existing lines grow older, critics warn that the risk of accidents on those lines will only increase. Winding under city streets and countryside, these lines stay invisible most of the time. Until they fail. Since 1986, pipeline accidents have killed more than 500 people, injured over 4,000, and cost nearly seven billion dollars in property damages. Using government data, ProPublica has mapped thousands of these incidents in a new interactive news application, which provides detailed information about the cause and costs of reported incidents going back nearly three decades. Unforeseen natural disasters also lead to dozens of incidents a year. From Bay Head to Long Beach Island, falling trees, dislodged homes and flooding caused more than 1,600 pipeline leaks. All leaks have been brought under control and no one was harmed, according to a New Jersey Natural Gas spokeswoman. But the company was forced to shut down service to the region, leaving 28,000 people without gas, and it may be months before they get it back. One of the biggest problems contributing to leaks and ruptures is pretty simple: pipelines are getting older. More than half of the nation's pipelines are at least 50 years old. Last year in Allentown Pa., a natural gas pipeline exploded underneath a city street, killing five people who lived in the houses above and igniting a fire that damaged 50 buildings. A fire rages through Allentown, PA, after a gas line explosion in Feb. 2011 Not all old pipelines are doomed to fail, but time is a big contributor to corrosion, a leading cause of pipeline failure. Corrosion is also cited as a chief concern of opponents of the Keystone XL extension. And in fact, none of the 14 spills that happened in the existing Keystone pipeline since 2010 were caused by corrosion, according to an investigation by the U.S. Department of State. The National Academies of Science is currently in the middle of study on dilbit and pipeline corrosion, due out by next year. In the meantime, TransCanada has already begun construction of the southern portion of the line, but has no assurance it will get a permit from the Obama administration to build the northern section. The agency only requires that seven percent of natural gas lines and 44 percent of all hazardous liquid lines be subject to their rigorous inspection criteria and inspected regularly. The rest of the regulated pipelines are still inspected, according to a PHMSA official, but less often. The inconsistent rules and inspection regime come in part from a historical accident. In the 60's and 70's, two laws established a federal role in pipeline safety and set national rules for new pipelines. For example, operators were required to conduct more stringent testing to see whether pipes could withstand high pressures, and had to meet new specifications for how deep underground pipelines must be installed. That pipeline, which burst open along a defective seam weld, would never have passed modern high-pressure requirements according to a federal investigation. But because it was installed in 1956, it was never required to. So older pipes were essentially grandfathered into less testing, he said. A GAO report estimates that of the roughly 230,000 miles of gathering lines, only 24,000 are federally regulated. Because many of these lines operate at lower pressures and generally go through remote areas, says the GAO, the government collects no data on ruptures or spills, and has no enforced standards for pipeline strength, welds, or underground depth on the vast majority of these pipes. Driven in part by the rising demands of hydraulic fracturing, operators have built thousands of miles of new lines to transport gas from fracked wells. Despite the fact that these lines are often just as wide as transmission lines (some up to 2 feet in diameter) and can operate under the same high pressures, they receive little oversight. However, Andrew Black, the president of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, a trade group whose members include pipeline operators, said that a one-size-fits-all approach would actually make pipelines less safe, because operators (not to mention pipelines) differ so widely. Allowing operators to develop their own strategies for each pipeline is critical to properly maintaining its safety, he contended. The agency has funding for only 137 inspectors, and often employs even less than that (in 2010 the agency had 110 inspectors on staff). According to the report, between 2001 and 2009 the agency reported a staffing shortfall of an average of 24 employees a year. Given the limitations of government money and personnel, it is often the industry that inspects its own pipelines. The agency has adopted, at least in part, dozens of safety standards written by the oil and natural gas industry. Operators point out that defining their own standards allows the inspection system to tap into real-world expertise. Adopted standards go through a rulemaking process that gives stakeholders and the public a chance to comment and suggest changes, according to the agency. Questions have also been raised about the ties between agency officials and the companies they regulate. Before joining the agency in 2009, PHMSA administrator Cynthia Quarterman worked as a legal counsel for Enbridge Energy, the operator involved in the Kalamazoo River accident. One such measure is the widespread installation of automatic or remote-controlled shutoff valves, which can quickly stop the flow of gas or oil in an emergency. These valves could help avoid a situation like that after the Kalamazoo River spill, which took operators 17 hours from the initial rupture to find and manually shut off. Operators use these valves already on most new pipelines, but argue that replacing all valves would not be cost-effective and false alarms would unnecessarily shut down fuel supplies. The CRS estimates that even if automatic valves were only required on pipelines in highly populated areas, replacing manual valves with automatic ones could cost the industry hundreds of millions of dollars. A worker on the Kalamazoo river, helping to clean up an oil spill of almost a million gallons from a ruptured pipeline in July 2010 Other measures focus on preventing leaks and ruptures in the first place. Last January, Obama signed a bill that commissioned several new studies to evaluate some of these proposed safety measures, although his decision on extending the Keystone pipeline may come long before those studies are completed.

HISTORY OF THE PROJECT The project's precursor was an informal group formed in San Francisco, California in the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001. The original purpose was to research changes in the world political economy; one subgroup studied Islamism and the changes in geopolitical inter-capitalist tensions; the other subgroup researched and attempted to intervene in class struggle. In October 2012 we regrouped as the Global Supply Chains class when we helped co-found the Bay Area Public School. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT Capitalism relies on an integrated infrastructure of production clusters and transportation networks, comprised of ports, warehouses, rail lines, highways, information grids and investment vehicles in order to produce and circulate goods. The physical nodes are arrayed in clusters of factories, warehouses, logistics services, and retail, all tied together by maritime, rail, trucking, and telecom networks. These networks generate flows of commodities and information with ever-increasing speed, as the system strives for just-in-time production and inventory-less distribution for a unified global market. Our project demonstrates how these nodes, clusters, networks, corridors and flows are interconnected within an integrated system of production, distribution and consumption. In providing useful and accessible real time information about conflicts along global supply chains, we aim to facilitate class-based collective action that forges connections and solidarity among related struggles. Our ultimate vision is a world beyond capitalist production and supply chains. In our experience, the ideal outcome is further questions, rather than facile answers.

The original estimate was around 176,000 gallons of oil. After further review, pipeline operator True Companies now reports about 12,615 barrels (529,830 gallons) of oil spilled, spokeswoman Wendy Owen told Inforum. The cause of the leak has not been determined. The spill contaminated a hillside and Ash Coulee Creek which empties into the Little Missouri River. The break was also significant because it happened less than 200 miles away from the Oceti Sakowin Camp, where Water Protectors were protesting the heavily contested Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The new number makes the Belle Fourche spill one of the largest in state history and perhaps the largest oil pipeline spill that contaminated a North Dakota water body, Bill Suess, spill investigation program manager for the state's Department of Health, told Inforum. North Dakota's largest spill happened in September 2013 when a Tesoro Corp. pipeline leaked about 840,000 gallons of fracked oil in a wheat field near Tioga, causing one of the biggest onshore oil spills in recent U.S. history. That spill has still not been cleaned up more than three years later. Additionally, based on data from Hart Energy, the revised estimate makes the Belle Fourche Pipeline spill the largest pipeline leak in all of 2016. Cleanup of the Belle Fourche Pipeline bust is still ongoing. Traces of benzene, a petrochemical solvent linked to cancer, have been detected throughout Ash Coulee Creek, Suess said. Despite repeated safety assurances from the industry, breaks happen. EcoWatch mentioned in October that 220 significant pipeline incidents occurred in 2016 and 3,032 since 2006. As EcoWatch reported, the Belle Fourche Pipeline Co. is part of the family-owned True Companies, which also operates Bridger Pipeline LLC. Both pipelines are operated from the same control room in Casper, Wyoming. From 2006 to 2014, Belle Fourche reported 21 incidents, leaking a total of 272,832 gallons of oil. Bridger Pipeline recorded nine pipeline incidents in the same period, spilling nearly 11,000 gallons of crude. A Belle Fourche pipeline that spilled 12,200 gallons in May, 2014 occurred on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land near Buffalo, Wyoming. It was later discovered that Belle Fourche did not have a permit to operate the land. Bridger was also responsible for dumping up to 50,000 gallons of crude into the Yellowstone River in 2015.

A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies.

A Fairy Tale, Say the Standing Rock Sioux By Susan Cosier Nine minutes. That's the longest it would take to detect a leak and shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) should the crude oil within begin escaping into the North Dakota prairie or the Missouri River. At least that's what Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the pipeline's owner, says. This is just one of the problems examined in a new report recently submitted to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which last February approved DAPL's controversial route snaking less than a mile from the tribe's reservation and upriver of tribal lands. In more than 300 pages, the document details many issues that the government never fully investigated when conducting its environmental review in 2016. The report, written by the Standing Rock Sioux and independent experts, delves into treaty agreements, the history of government takeover in the region, the inadequacy of ETP's risk analysis, and how one accident could ruin land, water, and a way of life. Don Holmstrom, an author of the report who worked with the U.S. Chemical Safety Board for 17 years, says that after noticing a break, workers would first have to decide what steps to take to stop the oil from coursing through the steel, an often stressful judgment. Then they must find and close the emergency flow restriction devices one by one, which can take time depending on how much pressure has built up in the pipeline. Standing Rock Sioux tribe member Dave Archambault Sr.Dave Archambault Sr. Of course, all that hinges on whether ETP realizes there's a leak in the first place. In reality, oil pipeline leaks frequently don't even register with control systems and operators; a farmer will simply notice a growing stain darkening a remote field and call it in. According to records obtained by the tribe and its technical team, no one at the company would be able to tell something was amiss if less than 1 percent of the 600,000 billion barrels it transports each day was oozing out. He tells me over the phone that he's currently gazing out over a frozen Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River where the Standing Rock Sioux get their drinking water. ETP's own documents state the company has to fly over the land near Lake Oahe every three weeks to look for spilled oil since so little foot traffic exists near the pipeline there. The Standing Rock Sioux and three other tribes continue to fight ETP in court. Ultimately they want the government to shut down the 1,172-mile pipeline that runs about four feet underground from North Dakota to Illinois. To do that, they need to document why a pipeline there is such a bad idea. In 1958, the Army Corps flooded 56,000 acres of agricultural land and wooded lowlands on which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe once depended as part of the Oahe Dam project Lake Oahe is a result of that project. Holmstrom said that Oahe pools are so close to the reservation, and provide wetland habitat for so many species, that the Corps should have considered it an HCA, or high-consequence area (i.e., a sensitive waterway). Such a designation would have required a more thorough environmental review that identified risks such as potential drinking water contamination, the sickening or killing of wildlife, and the suffocation of vegetation (to name a few). DAPL crosses beneath Lake Oahe just north of the Standing Rock Sioux tribal lands. That move further politicized the DAPL debate pitting industry against the tribe's safety. The Corps granted the pipeline's final permit a month later. He also required that an independent engineering company review whether ETP had complied with federal regulations and instructed the company to file an oil spill response plan. In the meantime, the oil would continue to flow at a rate of about half a million barrels a day. ETP submitted the third-party review and response plan in early April, even though the tribes argue they still haven't been fully involved in the process. The Army Corps will now meet with all four tribes before June 1 and then complete a new environmental review. Archambault, for one, hopes the tribe's own report will help push the company to better protect the Standing Rock Sioux's land and people from disaster, one way or another. The scorecard shows that 140 House members voted against chemical safeguards every time, while 149 members consistently voted for chemical safety protections. However, the action fund praised the lawmakers that bucked their party to vote for chemical safety, including Reps. voted for funding chemical reviews and against a farm bill that included pesticide safety loopholes. Florida Reps. A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

With their small, developing bodies, children are especially endangered by algae exposure. was the first major U.S. city where toxic algae outbreaks made tap water unsafe for human consumption. But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies. Macrophages, which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body, protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles. The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants. That's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA's Office of Inspector General (OIG), the agency's internal watchdog. EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement, and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency.

For months, opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline have been expressing fears that it would affect local drinking water, because it was to be built under the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation - the primary water source of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Last week, the US Department of the Army announced that it would not approve the crossing of the pipeline under the Missouri River. And while local drinking water will not be affected, at least two cows have been confirmed dead in the area, but a definitive connection between their deaths and the oil spill has not been made. Perhaps even more concerning than a freak accident splitting the pipe is the fact that electronic monitoring equipment failed to detect the leak - something that would have prevented the pipe from spilling so much oil out into the countryside.

For over 36 hours, myself and six other climbers hung from the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge in Coast Salish territories (Vancouver) putting our bodies in the way of a massive tar sands tanker and preventing it from passing through. Above us flew seven flags, each designed by an Indigenous artist from some of the main nations that have led the fight against the disastrous Trans Mountain pipeline and tanker expansion project. Each one of those flags is a symbol of resistance and hope, and a constant source of inspiration for all of us. Five other people supported us from the bridge. The entire team was made up of four people from British Columbia, three from Alberta (the source of the damage in the tar sands), one from Quebec, one from the United States (where the tar sands damage will be shipped), one from the United Kingdom, one from Mexico, and Will George, who is a Coast Salish member leading a lot of the opposition to this project, from Burnaby Mountain. Each one of us had our own reason for being there; our own motivation that helped us scale the bridge, overcome our nerves and risk arrest. For me, it was because I've seen the damage oil spills can bring. I was there just after a pipeline burst into the Red Deer river, risking the water supply of a city of more than 100,000 people. I was also with my friend and colleague when a pipeline burst in her community, in one of the largest spills in Alberta's history. I felt the helplessness she felt as community members called her asking for help that the government and the company never provided. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is the wrong choice. Those experiences stay with you. I've also seen the damage being done up north in the tar sands. We have choices for how we get our energy and travel. We have choices for how to create jobs, and build economies. And we have choices for whether we repeat the mistakes of the past or compound the damage. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion is the wrong choice. It violates our commitments to climate change, breaks our commitments to Indigenous peoples and threatens water resources all along the pipeline route. With the 400 tankers it would bring every year, it also threatens the entire west coast, and the economies, communities and hundreds of thousands of jobs that depend on an oil free coast line. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised climate action. Trudeau promised to respect Indigenous rights and Indigenous consent. He promised to fix the broken review process he put the Trans Mountain pipeline through. He promised to end fossil fuel subsidies, and protect this coast. If he continues to push this project, he will have violated all of those commitments. Bloomberg via Getty Images Demonstrators hold signs and chant during a protest against the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion, outside of the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in Whistler, B.C., on June 2, 2018. I wish Trudeau would have just lived up to his promises. I wish he wouldn't have caved to the oil lobby and instead maintained the courage he showed in Paris. I wish the Haida tattoo he has on his shoulder would mean a little more, and his promises for Indigenous reconciliation were more than words. So, on July 3 and 4, I spent 36 hours hanging from a bridge to try to help Trudeau live up to his own promises. I wish I didn't have to do it (I don't really like heights) but here we are. When I asked myself what would I do to protect the things I love, that's the answer I came up with. They're doing it because there aren't many other options, and it endangers the things they love. There's still time for Trudeau to make the right decision and reject this pipeline. But if he doesn't, we'll be here waiting. We aren't going away. Share your story on HuffPost Canada blogs.

Mar 16, 2017 By Cook Inletkeeper In a preview of what could happen with offshore drilling in the Arctic Ocean, an underwater natural gas pipeline has been leaking in Alaska since December, and no repair is expected until late April, at the earliest. The lack of urgency to stop this leak by the federal and state governments and by industry is remarkable. Sea ice makes conditions too dangerous for divers to reach the pipeline, which was built in Cook Inlet south of Anchorage in 1965. The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and the Alaska Department of Environmental Protection have not made the owner, Hillcorp Alaska, shut it down even though the federal agency found that the leak poses risks to public safety and the environment. The pipeline supplies natural gas to multiple oil-drilling platforms in Cook Inlet. The Hilcorp Liberty project is in the portion of the Arctic Ocean currently available for leasing. To ensure safety, the federal government has imposed limits on boating and aviation in the area of the Cook Inlet leak. Escaping methane could kill marine life by displacing oxygen in the water, posing a threat to Cook Inlet beluga whales, which were listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 2008. Some parts of the inlet, including the area of the leak, have been designated as critical habitat for the whales. Sea otters, some humpback whales, threatened eiders and an endangered population of Steller sea lions also call the inlet home.

By Wendy Koch, National Geographic PUBLISHED January 20, 2015 The scenic Yellowstone River has suffered its second sizable oil spill in four years, prompting truckloads of drinking water to be shipped into the eastern Montana city of Glendive. The latest spill is not expected to affect Yellowstone National Park, about 350 miles upstream. Some oil from the weekend spill got into a water supply intake along the river that serves about 6,000 people in Glendive, according to preliminary tests at the city's water treatment plant. The sample showed elevated levels of volatile organic compounds, predominantly benzene, that would explain the odor in tap water, officials at the plant said. The potential health risks are uncertain until further testing is complete, they said. A breach along the Poplar Pipeline caused a spill of up to 50,000 gallons of oil produced in the Bakken shale fields of Montana and North Dakota, Bridger Pipeline announced Saturday. Though the park is located southwest of the spill, Salvin says the 692-mile-long Yellowstone River flows northward from the park through Montana into North Dakota. Another spill into Yellowstone River occurred 235 miles southwest of Glendive in July 2011, when an ExxonMobil pipeline broke near Laurel, Montana, and released 63,000 gallons of oil that washed up along an 85-mile stretch of riverbank. After the latest spill, initial water tests showed no evidence of oil, but residents soon complained that their tap water had an unusual odor. An advisory against using it was issued late Monday by the city's treatment plant. Bridger Pipeline said the break in the 12-inch steel pipe happened in an area about five miles upstream of Glendive, an agricultural community in east-central Montana near the North Dakota border. An Environmental Protection Agency official said an oil sheen was detected near Sidney, about 60 miles downstream. The EPA said it was working with Bridger, local and state officials as well as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Department of Transportation to contain the spill. It said responders are placing containment structures across the Yellowstone River at Sidney, Montana, about 30 miles downstream of the spill. The river is partially frozen, complicating the cleanup effort. The Poplar Pipeline, which runs from Canada to Baker, Montana, carries crude oil from the Bakken oil fields. It remained closed Monday as crews worked to pump out any oil left in the section where the breach occurred. It cannot be restarted until it receives approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which dispatched inspectors to the area. The EPA says 14,000 oil spills are reported each year, but it says many are small enough to be cleaned up by the company that caused them.

San Antonio-based Tesoro Logistics, which owns the 20-year-old North Dakota pipeline, said Tuesday that it will repair and replace a 200-foot section of the tube. Jensen is all for analysis, but he's also looking to be made whole. It took nearly two weeks for officials to tell the public about the massive rupture that occurred in a remote area of Tioga.

Expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline in Canada, which would triple the amount of oil transported from the Alberta tar-sands fields to a Vancouver-area port, faces opposition on both sides of the border, and multiple lawsuits. Spur line connects to Washington refineries. Source: Kinder Morgan Inc. Approval is not a slam dunk, said Gurpal Dosanjh, a refining analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects. And here's what we're reading related to the controversy. March 28: What the completed Dakota Access pipeline means for key players. Feb. 22: Preparing to leave, Standing Rock protesters ceremonially burn camp. Feb. 1: Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back. Even it if is approved, Kinder Morgan could have a long slog ahead. The project is opposed by the mayors of Vancouver, Victoria and Burnaby, as well as many First Nations, and already faces multiple lawsuits. Major environmental groups, including Greenpeace Canada, Sierra Club BC and Raincoast Conservation, also oppose the project. The company notes that pipelines are safer and cheaper than shipping oil by rail. In Canada, the pipeline has the support of the federal government. That has Canada all the hungrier to move oil to other export markets on the Pacific Rim, Klassen said. Concerns about spills and stoking global warming by increased use of fossil fuels have native nations and environmental groups on both sides of the border fighting the project. They are drafting momentum from the recent defeat by Washington tribes of a major coal-export terminal at Cherry Point, and the fierce resistance led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota that has bedeviled the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Cam Fenton, Canada communications Manager for 350.org, an environmental group focused on climate change, says his organization is preparing for large-scale mass civil disobedience. In Longview, Millennium Bulk Terminals has proposed the largest coal-export facility anywhere in North America. In Vancouver, Tesoro-Savage has proposed an oil-by-rail transfer facility with the capacity to move an average of 360,000 barrels of oil every day. The Westway oil-by-rail expansion in Grays Harbor, home to key bird habitat on the Pacific flyway, and a treaty-protected tribal fisheries, is opposed by environmentalists and the Quinault Indian Nation. Oil to both the Tesoro-Savage and the Westway terminals would be transported in rail cars, which have been involved in accidents and spills, most recently in Mosier, Ore. Kinder Morgan wants to begin construction on Trans Mountain in 2017 and finish by 2019. We have committed shippers with long-term contracts for 15 to 20 years for space on that pipeline. Visitors to Cates Park look across Burrard Inlet to the Kinder Morgan tank farm. Cates Park was once a summer village site of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation. There have been 82 reported spills since 1961 at pump stations and terminals along the pipeline. The diluted bitumen and other products that would be shipped in the expansion is the same as Kinder Morgan ships from its pipeline today, and would be shipped in the same Aframax tankers that take delivery from the existing pipeline. Beyond the soft handshake and diplomatic demeanor of tribal elders in the homeland of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, where the pipeline terminates in the east end of the Burrard Inlet in North Vancouver, B.C., lies a steely resistance. Amy George, in her 70s, helped lead a demonstration of thousands in Vancouver last week against the expansion. What unites this tribal nation with tribes and communities across the border in Washington is concern for the shared ecosystem. Tsleil-Waututh hereditary Chief Sla-holt (Ernest George Sr.), 76, thinks the Burrard Inlet in North Vancouver, B.C., has already seen too much industrial development. Under the Trans Mountain project, the dock would be expanded from one berth to three. The number of tanks holding the oil would more than double, and those would hold more than triple the amount of oil. Impacts from the expansion would be experienced far beyond the inlet. The project would bring an additional 350 tankers carrying oil a year to the Salish Sea, marine waters shared by British Columbia and Washington state. Spills could be damaging either from fuel-oil transfers to tankers, or from the diluted bitumen the tankers carry, the department warned in a September 2016, letter to the Canadian government. The Salish Sea is particularly vulnerable to a big uptick in tanker traffic because of its swift currents, sharp turns required for big ships and rich marine resources. The assessment by the Tsleil-Waututh Nation found their people would bear the brunt of the impacts at the end of the pipeline. Hereditary Chief Sla-holt (Ernest George Sr.), 76, reminds a visitor his people have been here some 13,000 years, or, as they say here, since time out of mind. He and his neighbors think this stretch of water has already seen too much industrial development. Ed Thomas, 64, says efforts to clean up the inlet have just recently enabled the band to hold its first clam harvest in 30 years. Elk are coming back to the woods.

And he signed an executive order to expedite environmental reviews of other infrastructure projects. The statement paves the way for the administration to start laying out their environmental policy agenda, which is looking decidedly pro oil and gas. Rewriting the Rulebook What stands out the most is the tone of the administration towards environmental regulation, regarding it generally as a nuisance to economic growth. Jobs at all costs, including polluting and ramping up global climate change, looks to be the play here. This represents a radical departure from how we have been doing business under the Obama administration, and confirms all suspicions that this administration will not be prioritizing environmental concerns. Trump and the Republicans have long had their sites set on the regulatory apparatus where this matter is concerned. The Push Back Environmentalists and Native American activists are already pushing back hard against this announcement. Greenpeace has issued a statement against the move: A powerful alliance of Indigenous communities, ranchers, farmers, and climate activists stopped the Keystone and the Dakota Access pipelines the first time around, and the same alliances will come together to stop them again if Trump tries to raise them from the dead. Look for this debate to heat up in the public arena in the coming months.

Share to facebook Share to twitter Share to linkedin Energy Transfer Equity cofounder Kelcy Warren reviews documents in his Dallas office. The controversial Dakota Access Pipeline is being built by a company subsidiary. Investors, apparently, are not among them. The soft-spoken Texan owes much of the bump to the climbing stock price of Energy Transfer Equity, the Dallas-based oil and gas giant he cofounded and chairs. Warren personally views his spiking net worth as nothing more than a rebound from a dreadful 2015, when Energy Transfer suffered from soft commodities prices and an investor-reviled proposed merger with Williams Companies, an Oklahoman rival. But Energy Transfer has undoubtedly also benefited from the election of Donald Trump. The donations, Warren suggests, were money well spent. The oil line, which will connect production fields in North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois, has generated tremendous controversy, in part over concerns that it will threaten the water supply of adjacent Native American tribes. Protesters have clashed fiercely with local law enforcement, whom they have accused of deploying excessive force. Warren is pleased with the turnabout, but dismisses the legitimacy of the initial roadblock. Born in rural Texas to an oil field worker father, he failed out of the University of Texas at Arlington during his freshman year, though later returned to complete a civil engineering degree. In 1993, after stints at a number of energy firms, he partnered with friend Ray Davis to purchase Endevco, a former employer, out of bankruptcy. They sold the business for a profit two years later and founded Energy Transfer soon after. The firm is now back on the upswing, and has plans to merge Energy Transfer Partners with Sunoco Logistics to further streamline its balance sheet.

Tesoro oil spill still not cleaned up One of the largest onshore oil spills in US history continues to highlight the dangers of oil pipelines, as the battle over the four-state Dakota Access pipeline continues. The massive oil spill still isn't fully cleaned up three years and three months after it happened, and the company responsible hasn't set a date for completion. Less than a third has been cleaned up. In the wake of another spill this month, 150 miles further south, as well as the ongoing debate over the four-state Dakota Access pipeline, the slow progress of the Tesoro Corp. cleanup is causing some consternation. A farmer noticed the smell of oil permeating the air for days on end, and the wheels of his combine became coated in the stuff. Yet Bill Suess, a North Dakota Health Department environmental scientist, worries that much of the oil may never be removed. Neither is believed to have contaminated any water sources, but in the Belfield incident an estimated 176,000 gallons of oil spewed into a creek that feeds the Little Missouri River, a tributary of the Missouri River. Freezing temperatures appear to have limited the spread. The builder of that pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, says that remote monitoring will allow workers to shut down the pipeline in case of a leak. When oil spewed from the Belfield line earlier this month, monitoring equipment failed to detect the leak, and it fell to another farmer to raise the alarm. Far from any major population centers, no water sources were threatened, but an unknown amount of private and US Forest Service land along the waterway was fouled. Crews have been digging as deep as 50 feet, removing hundreds of thousands of tons of tainted soil. Get unlimited Monitor journalism. Log in for unlimited digital access.

Announcing the decision on Sunday, the Army said alternative routes should be explored. That would mean environmental reviews that could delay construction for months or even years. Hours later, Energy Transfer Partners released a statement that decried the decision and struck a defiant tone: The White House's directive today to the Corps for further delay is just the latest in a series of overt and transparent political actions by an administration which has abandoned the rule of law in favor of currying favor with a narrow and extreme political constituency. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way. Indeed, Energy Transfer Partners appears to have a powerful ally in Republican President-elect Donald Trump. Days before the Army announced it was blocking the proposed Dakota Access route, Trump said for the first time that he supports the pipeline's completion. But last month, a spokesperson for Trump said he sold his shares in the company over the summer. 'Quietly building resistance' The day after the Army handed down its decision on the Dakota Access Pipeline, it announced a public hearing on water permits for another controversial Energy Transfer Partners project: the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, which would cut through the ecologically important Atchafalaya Basin wetlands in south central Louisiana. The hearing will take place in Baton Rouge on Jan. 12. Energy Transfer Partners owns Bayou Bridge Pipeline LLC, whose name appears on the project's Louisiana permit applications. Energy Transfer and Sunoco already built a pipeline carrying crude oil from the Texas coast to Louisiana's Lake Charles area, and this new leg would extend it to St. James just west of New Orleans. It's part of Energy Transfer's pipeline network carrying North Dakota crude to an Illinois tank farm and then on to Gulf Coast refineries and ports. Along the way, the 162-mile-long, 24-inch diameter pipeline would cross eight Louisiana watersheds including the Atchafalaya Basin, where the river of the same name converges with the Gulf of Mexico. It's an ecologically important area as Louisiana's only growing delta, and it contains the largest river swamp and largest contiguous bottomland hardwood forest in North America. It's also home to nine federal- and state-listed endangered or threatened wildlife species and six endangered or threatened bird species. The Atchafalaya Basin already faces threats from Louisiana's oil and gas industry, among them oil waste pollution and canal dredging that's causing water quality problems. Those issues would be compounded by pipeline spills and other accidents, which are not rare events. Meanwhile, an ongoing effort to catalog oil and gas industry incidents in Louisiana documented six pipeline accidents in that state alone over a two-week period. While the media spotlight has focused on protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline, opposition to the proposed Bayou Bridge Pipeline has been growing, as The Daily Advertiser reports: Environmental groups, some landowners and concerned citizens are quietly building resistance to the Bayou Bridge Pipeline project, gathering thousands of signatures from as far away as New Zealand and South Africa, forcing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to call for a public hearing where they plan to demand a thorough environmental impact assessment of the project. The Atchafalaya Basinkeeper program, part of the Waterkeeper Alliance, collected almost 75,000 signatures on a petition calling on the Corps to hold public hearings and prepare an environmental impact statement for the project. The environmental advocacy groups Bold Louisiana and Gulf Restoration Network are also petitioning for a thorough environmental assessment and calling on Energy Transfer to consider alternative routes.

The United States wanted to stop that from happening. So the American embassy in Slovakia hired a Texas-based oil consultant and began secretly advising the Slovakian government on how to buy the 49 percent stake Yukos had held in Transpetrol, the Slovakian oil pipeline company. With no oil experience of its own, the Slovakian government didn't know how much it should pay. Gazprom was willing to pay far more. Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. The communication, part of the cache of State Department cables that WikiLeaks passed to McClatchy and other news organizations, is just one indication of how the U.S. government over the years has maneuvered to influence the world's oil and natural gas markets. Gazprom alone is mentioned in 1,789. In the cables, U.S. diplomats can be found plotting ways to prevent state entities such as Gazprom from taking control of key petroleum facilities, pressing oil companies to adjust their policies to match U.S. foreign policy goals, helping U.S.-based oil companies arrange deals on favorable terms and pressing foreign governments to assist companies that are willing to do the U.S.'s bidding. Sometimes the U.S. approach seems mystifying. An Aug. 17, 2009, secret cable from the U.S. embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, recalled how days earlier the U.S. charge d'affaires, Richard Erdman, pushed Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al Naimi to get closer to China. But there was an ulterior motive. At the time, the United States was trying to persuade China to back sanctions against Iran over the country's nuclear fuel enrichment program. The U.S. believes the program is part of an Iranian effort to develop nuclear weapons. Naimi responded that Saudi Arabia, a bitter rival to Iran, would soon be the largest oil supplier to China, and it came to pass. In 2010, Saudi Arabia was the top oil supplier to China. Iran was third, according to the Chinese website ChinaOilWeb. A July 30, 2009, secret cable from the U.S embassy in Riyadh recounts how Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, while visiting the kingdom, leaned on his Saudi counterpart, Ibrahim al Assaf, to contain rising oil prices. The documents also show how in their global hunt for oil, companies from allied countries and foes alike complicate U.S. policy objectives.

Both efforts to expand its presence in Iran and its close ties to Russia's Gazprom are frequent topics in the cables. The embassy was particularly unhappy that Eni sought to structure its new business in Iran in such a way that it could claim that Iran was merely repaying old debts owed to the company, some dating to the 1950s. That would allow Eni to help Iran develop the fields and skirt any sanctions imposed over Iran's nuclear program, which the U.S. believes is intended to develop nuclear weapons. The embassy urged U.S. officials in Washington to lean on Scaroni during an upcoming visit to squelch any deal. A subsequent cable indicates they did. Scaroni was poised to try again with the Obama administration, according to a May 5, 2009, account of a meeting with another Eni official. Eni's ties with Gazprom were the subject of an April 24, 2008, cable that urged the State and Treasury departments to express displeasure very clearly to Scaroni. Specifically at issue was an Eni deal that would have given Gazprom access to Libyan oil and would have had Eni help Gazprom build a pipeline across the Black Sea. This project would have competed with a similar project backed by the U.S. government that would have connected gas fields in the Caspian region directly to Europe, bypassing Russia and Gazprom. At the time, Silvio Berlusconi was about to become Italy's prime minister for a second time and the embassy urged headquarters to twist his arm as well. Eni has been in the news of late because it's the largest player in Libya's oil sector and Scaroni publicly voiced concern that U.S.-led efforts to oust strongman Moammar Gadhafi weren't in Italy's interest. On April 20, Scaroni announced that Eni was temporarily shelving its deal in Libya that would have given Gazprom a big stake in Libyan oil, a move the leaked documents show the U.S. had been seeking since 2008. Sometimes, however, U.S. efforts were aimed at unleashing Russian oil. A secret cable from Moscow dated April 16, 2009, tells how Houston-based ConocoPhillips planned to join the Russian firm Lukoil in bidding on oil contracts in Iraq. The joint effort in Iraq had the blessing of Putin, ConocoPhillips officials said, who noted that Putin had offered to provide debt relief to Iraq if the U.S.-Russian consortium were granted a contract. Iraqi oil was the subject of many cables from diplomats in Iraq, including a number that dealt with the surprise 2007 announcement that Texas-based Hunt Oil Co. had entered into a production sharing agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq's north. The problem was Iraq hadn't yet passed its national oil law and the company's CEO, Dallas businessman Ray Hunt, was a friend of President George W. Bush. And Hunt served on Bush's foreign intelligence advisory committee. A Sept. 9, 2007, cable from the U.S. government's Kurdistan Regional Reconstruction Team described Hunt Oil's Middle East manager, David McDonald, as unconcerned about the legalities of the deal. The cables are filled with information about the energy industry that can't help but surprise. One cable from the U.S. embassy in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea, argues that the Obama administration should be paying closer attention to the small West African nation, noting that a sudden reversal of political winds could cost hundreds of American oil workers their jobs and threaten 20 percent of the U.S. oil supply. The cable added that Spain and China are making oil plays in the country where U.S. companies Marathon Oil Corp. and Hess Corp. have as much as 30 percent of their capital invested. Despite the unsavory reputation of Equatorial Guinea President Teodoro Obiang, who's proclaimed himself a living god, the time seemed right to reboot bilateral relations, the cable suggested, noting that Obama is a common surname there."}, {"URL": "http://act.climatehawksvote.com/calpers_divest_from_dapl?recruiter_id=1838988", "Timestamp": "20180918230327", "Sentences": "In the process of construction, Energy Transfer Partners has already damaged numerous sacred sites and would drill under the Missouri River, the sole drinking water source of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print The increasingly brutal police response to protests over the construction of The Dakota Access Pipeline has pushed the debate over the safety of oil infrastructure into the national spotlight. Oil industry supporters argue that pipelines are safer alternative to hauling fuel by tanker trucks or freight trains. He cites an environmental impact statement conducted by the U.S. State Department comparing the impact of rail delivery of crude oil to that of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. Additionally, a 2013 study from the conservative Manhattan Institute found that road transportation had an annual accident rate of 19.95 incidents per billion ton miles and rail transportation had 2.08 incidents per billion ton miles, compared to 0.89 incidents per billion ton miles for natural gas transmission and 0.58 serious incidents per billion ton miles for hazardous liquid pipelines. Environmentalists, however, point to a lack of adequate state and federal regulation and the difficulties of maintaining millions of miles of aging pipeline infrastructure in their warnings about the dangers of spills, fires, and other accidents. And data from the federal government suggests such concerns should be taken seriously. Over the last thirty years, just under 9,000 significant pipeline-related incidents have taken place nationwide, according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. To better understand the extent of this damage, CityLab mapped out all significant pipeline accidents between 1986 and 2016, based on data compiled by Richard Stover, an environmental advocate and former research astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In the map above, you can see the locations of all significant oil and gas pipeline incidents since 1986 in which the federal government provided location data. (Note: In incident cases without longitude and latitude information in the federal data, Stover geolocated incidents based on their county data. The incidents are sized bigger and shaded darker as the financial damage associated with each incident increases. Zoom in on the map to get a more fine-grained view of the incident clustering and click on individuals dots to see specifics about related fatalities, injuries, and financial costs. Stover points out the locations reflect the footprint of oil and gas pipeline distribution networks nationwide, suggesting that wherever pipelines are extended, deadly accidents will follow. Incidents are particularly common, for example, in Texas and Louisiana, where numerous lines carry oil and gas, extracted on- and off-shore, to serve the rest of the country. People are killed. To illustrate other dimensions of this damage, we created time lapse maps to show the accumulation of fatalities and injuries associated with pipeline incidents. Below is a time lapse map of fatalities resulting from pipeline incidents between 1986 and 2016. Red dots indicate incidents that resulted in fatalities and black dots indicate incidents without fatalities that could be geolocated. The map below illustrates significant incidents that resulted in injuries (in yellow) that could be geolocated. Such incidents accounted for 1,438 of all 9,006 pipeline-related accidents. As the time lapse shows, significant pipeline-related incidents have picked up in recent years in certain states. Anti-pipeline activist Isabella Zizi, a member of the Northern Cheyenne, Arikara, and Muskogee Creek tribes, is an organizer with Idle No More SF Bay, which has been leading a national call to divest from financial institutions funding the Dakota Access Pipeline. The 1,172 mile Dakota Access Pipeline, stretching from North Dakota to Illinois, would carry 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day if completed. But its future is still uncertain. In recent weeks, police have used increasingly aggressive means to confront protesters, including water cannons, tear-gas grenades, and sound weapons. Regardless of what happens at Standing Rock, Zizi says he expects deadly pipeline accidents will continue to flare up nationwide. But this is contaminating our land, our soil, our air, our water. Correction: an earlier version of this article errantly stated that the data represented the last twenty, rather than thirty, years of pipeline accidents. The original version also mistakenly attributed data about the numbers and costs of pipeline accidents to the PHMSA, rather than to Dr. Richard Stover."}, {"URL": "https://www.google.com/search?q=january+oil+spill+list&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&hl=en-us&client=safari", "Timestamp": "20180919005439", "Sentences": "Feb 28, 2018 ...

In a letter to FERC Chairman Norman Bay, Congressman Lynch highlighted the serious public safety risks of placing a natural gas pipeline in densely populated areas such as West Roxbury and Weymouth. In the wake of these explosions, it is reckless for FERC to allow Spectra to proceed with the proposed projects in Weymouth and West Roxbury. On November 16, a natural gas pipeline explosion killed one Ameren Illinois employee and injured twelve people in Canton, Illinois. This follows an October gasoline pipeline explosion in Shelby County, Alabama, which killed one pipeline worker and injured five others, igniting two wildfires that burned over 30 acres of land. In April, a natural gas pipeline in Salem, Pennsylvania, operated by Spectra Energy, exploded injuring one person and damaging two homes. Congressman Lynch's letter highlights the dangerous and costly damage that pipeline explosions have inflicted on communities in 2016 alone. Congressman Lynch is calling on FERC and PHMSA to fully investigate these incidents to determine whether further safety measures need to be adopted prior to approving construction of high pressure natural gas lines in West Roxbury and Weymouth.

During the Obama administration, the Army Corps of Engineers (COE) slowed the regulatory review process of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) to accommodate the cultural and environmental concerns of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. In the first weeks of the Trump administration, however, the COE reversed its stance and approved the DAPL to move forward. While there are many lessons and legal issues involved with the DAPL controversy, the case also raises questions of domestic sovereignty. By instructing the Army Corp of Engineers to forego an environmental review and approve the easement needed to complete the pipeline, we believe the Trump administration has shown disregard for the tribe as a sovereign body. As scholars who have over 40 years of combined experience working with and researching state and local governments, we see this stance having implications beyond this one pipeline. These moves reveal a hasty president unbound by the needs, authorities and rights of other people and governments. Trump appears to be satisfied only by obedience. Completion of the 1,172-mile DAPL requires an easement to allow the company building the pipeline to run pipe under Lake Oahe. Shortly thereafter, Acting Assistant Army Secretary Douglas Lamont canceled further environmental studies and allowed the project to proceed. The tribe has asked for serious consideration of the impacts this project could have on culturally significant resources. Additional critical issues are looming in California that will test the extent to which the Trump administration is willing to exert federal rights. For example, the state is seeking a waiver to set stringent fuel economy standards and enact policies that will provide retirement security for low-income workers, a plan the GOP-led Congress opposes. And based on his statements and actions thus far, we can expect Trump to make similar arguments as California and several states and cities prepare to fight for their sovereign powers on this and potentially other issues. San Francisco, for example, has claimed the executive order concerning sanctuary cities unconstitutionally intrudes on sovereignty in violation of the 10th Amendment of the Constitution. This apparent disrespect for state and tribal sovereignty could catalyze conflicts among domestic authorities. State and local governments will likely refuse to fall in line and give up the powers reserved to states and local governments to please Trump. Thus, the size of the sandbox in which Trump administration will operate is fast becoming a battleground. Dissent by tribes and state and local governments is understandable and justifiable. When sovereignty is questioned and when power is centralized domestically in a hegemonic and authoritative rule, civil society loses the benefits of responsive, representative, cooperative and localized government. Citizens are also disconnected from their government and political life. It takes an attentive public and a good president to recognize this consequence as bad.

But in recent months, their efforts have been re-energized by the protests in North Dakota. About 25 attendees at Friday's meeting were young people who'd made the trek south from the Dakota Access pipeline protests to engage and stage demonstrations in Window Rock. The November meetings concerned the amendment of a Resource Management Plan for the region, which sets guidelines for how the Bureau of Land Management allows public lands to be used. The current plan was passed in 2003, before modern fracking technology was being widely used in the area. As a result, the current RMP does not account for the dangers such techniques might pose. This lapse has allowed the BLM to approve permits for more than 360 new oil wells on and around indigenous land, according to the Sierra Club. Many Navajo and other concerned residents want the plan changed so it recognizes for these new threats. Both battles stem from indigenous people's objections to oil interests that endanger natural resources on or near their lands. Both started as local confrontations that gestated for more than a year before outsiders started paying attention. And both were responses to brief oil booms in their respective states. The cost of this development has been steep for local people. Oil development in the area over the last century has created a methane gas hotspot so intense it is visible from outer space via spectrometer, according to the Denver Post. Meanwhile, many archaeological and paleontological sites in the region remain protected from the drilling. But considering what a rich site of indigenous history the Greater Chaco area has proven to be, it's unclear what's being lost to obscurity as developers lay waste to the landscape. In July, 36 oil tanks caught fire near the small Navajo town of Nageezi, New Mexico, forcing 55 people to evacuate their homes while the blaze raged for three days. It doesn't end there. The next battlefront in this conflict could very well be the region's own version of the Dakota Access pipeline. But according to Eisenfeld and Goodman, Navajo community members and other environmental advocates have succeeded in delaying the project pending the completion of an environmental impact statement, which may take up to two years. The 2003 Resource Management Plan amendment process is still ongoing. There's a lot more courage now here, and a lot more speaking out. That's what we need.

Despite his previous remarks concerning NAFTA, Trump did not address the company and its lawsuit before approving the project. Following months of national opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the Department of the Army ordered an environmental review of the project in December of 2016. The pipeline was originally proposed to cross the Missouri River just above Bismarck, North Dakota, but after complaints, it was rerouted to cross the river along sacred Tribal grounds, less than a mile from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Trump had invested in Energy Transfer, the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. His spokespeople have claimed that he has since divested, but no proof has been presented. Donald Trump has been in office for four days and he's already proving to be the dangerous threat to our climate we feared he would be. But, these pipelines are far from being in the clear. The millions of Americans and hundreds of Tribes that stood up to block them in the first place will not be silenced and will continue fighting these dirty and dangerous projects. Trump claims he's a good businessman, yet he's encouraging dirty, dangerous tar sands development when clean energy is growing faster, producing more jobs and has a real future. Trump claims he cares about the American people, but he's allowing oil companies to steal and threaten their land by constructing dirty and dangerous pipelines through it. Trump claims he wants to protect people's clean air and water, but he's permitting a tar sand superhighway that will endanger both and hasten the climate crisis. The Keystone pipeline was rejected because it was not in the country's interest and the environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline was ordered because of the threats it poses to the Standing Rock Sioux. Nothing has changed. These pipelines were a bad idea then and they're a bad idea now. Simply put, Donald Trump is who we thought he is: a person who will sell off Americans' property and Tribal rights, clean air and safe water to corporate polluters.

Early estimates put the spill at around 5,000 barrels, which was later adjusted down to 700. One barrel of oil contains 42 gallons, so nearly 30,000 gallons of crude may have been spilled. Fire officials and hazmat teams are on the scene of Ventura County oil spill. He said he called 911 after smelling and hearing the flowing crude, and then rode his motor scooter up the canyon to find oil gushing from an above-ground box. The leak prompted a swift hazmat response to contain the spill and prevent the oil from entering the Pacific Ocean. The responders included several local and state agencies, including the California Fish and Wildlife Office of Spill Prevention and Response, the Ventura and Oxnard County fire departments and the Coast Guard Marine Safety Detachment Santa Barbara. The pipeline is owned by Crimson Pipeline, a privately-owned midstream pipeline company that owns and operates approximately 1,500 miles of pipelines across California and the Gulf of Mexico. The oil itself is owned by Aera Energy, the largest onshore oil producer in Ventura County, which produces an average of 13,000 barrels per day. The exact cause of the leak is still unknown.

David Braun, co-founder of Rootskeeper, spoke on behalf of Californians Against Fracking in a press statement: Firefighters racing to block thousands of gallons of oil from dumping into our beautiful ocean sounds like a scene from a Hollywood disaster movie, but these devastating images are the reality in California. There is no incentive for oil companies to properly maintain their sites and to stop spilling because federal and state regulations and regulator agencies are so weak and there are no penalties. That is more spillage than the Exxon Valdez. Onshore. In one year. At this point, we cannot even call these spills. Spills happen by accident. This is no accident, this is a permanent state of criminal negligence. The oil and gas industry is so sloppy, so irresponsible, so damaging that their behavior amounts to crimes against nature and against humanity. If terrorists despoiled this much water and land and resources in the U.S., it would be all over the news every day. Since the oil and gas industry owns the government, there's hardly ever even the most paltry fines and penalties.

Oil prices are on the up again, President Donald Trump promises to sweep away many of the restrictions the industry had imposed upon it during the Obama Administration, the former head of ExxonMobil is Secretary of State and there is even talk of watering down fuel economy requirements. Trump has pushed through executive orders to revive the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines and he has even promised to revive the moribund US coal industry, causing shares in coal miners to soar. But a new report suggests that demand for coal and oil could peak by 2020 thanks to dramatic falls in the cost of solar power and electric vehicles. The report, Expect the Unexpected: The Disruptive Power of Low-Carbon Technology, co-authored by the Grantham Institute for the study of Climate Change and the Environment at Imperial College, London and the Carbon Tracker Initiative, says that the big energy companies are seriously under-estimating the speed at which low-carbon technologies are advancing and they could be left with stranded assets unless they change their approach . Carbon Tracker says that EVs will be cheaper than conventional internal combustion engines from 2020 and could have a fifth of the road transport market by 2030. This could displace 25m bpd of oil by 2050, in stark contrast to the continuous growth in oil demand the industry expects. The report argues that the use of Business-As-Usual scenarios should be retired and that scenarios should now apply, as a minimum, the latest cost reduction projections for solar PV and EVs, along with emissions commitments nations have made in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Climate Agreement, to reflect the current state of the low-carbon transition. Most major oil and gas companies do not expect coal to peak before 2030 and none see peak oil demand occurring before 2040.

Huff, staff writer Tags: North Dakota, oil spills, cover-up SocialBlock(); (NaturalNews) When it comes to the general public being kept in the loop about matters relating to major environmental hazards, the residents of North Dakota are perhaps the most slighted of all by their own state government. A major oil and natural gas region of the country, North Dakota has had hundreds of oil spill accidents over the years that have caused noteworthy environmental destruction, but none of them, save for one, was ever reported. North Dakotans: we need to know about the spillsKuster's livelihood depends on having access to clean water and healthy soils, two things that are seriously threatened by the prospect of oil spills. For the most part, Kuster says he's well-rounded in his knowledge about local happenings, except when it comes to the actions of oil companies. In this regard, everything is kept under lock and key. Kuster and his neighbors aren't convinced that oil spills like those that have occurred throughout North Dakota are harmless to the environment, either. They all say they observed at least one incident in which truckloads of what appeared to be oil-tainted dirt were being hauled off from a nearby property. The incident was believed to have involved a broken oil pipeline, but nobody knows for sure. In the interest of protecting not only local residents but the rest of the country that eats food grown in potentially tainted soils, it's critical that North Dakotans and people from other states where oil pipelines are present be kept in the loop about spills. It's unacceptable, say independent experts, for the government to withhold this information from the public. They continue to push for reforms that would force regulatory agencies to provide full disclosure on all issues involving oil and natural gas, for the benefit of everyone.

You are here: Home Environment This Proposed Pipeline Has Eerie Similarities To Standing Rock Environment, In the News, This Proposed Pipeline Has Eerie Similarities To Standing Rock The Story Behind The Atlantic And Mountain Valley Pipelines by Walter Yeates March 28, 2017, 11:05 am 294 SHARES Share Tweet This is the first article in a series which looks into the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which has stunning similarities to the Dakota Access and Standing Rock story. The people at Standing Rock think of themselves as protectors and not protestors. The proposed routes for the Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast pipelines. Yost is a high school math teacher who went on leave to fight against the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP). Along with the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), these two shale gas pipelines would stretch approximately 850 miles. The ACP alone would stretch approximately 500 miles, beginning in West Virginia and running through Virginia and North Carolina. Investors began heavily pushing for the pipeline build-out in what is known as the Marcellus and Utica shale region in 2014, with survey and route planning beginning in May of that year. The pre-filing request with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission took place later in October of 2014. The ACP was proposed by Dominion Pipeline, Duke Energy, Piedmont Natural Gas, and AGL Resources and the MVP was proposed by EQT Midstream Partner, NextEra US Gas Assets, WGL Midstream, and Vega Midstream MVP. A graph demonstrating natural gas demands in Virginia and the Carolinas. And it points out that regulators have not considered whether these pipelines are the best use of ratepayer dollars. The IEFFA suggests the following after reviewing their report on the pipelines: That the applications for the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines be suspended until a regional planning process can be developed for pipeline infrastructure; That FERC lower the returns on equity granted to pipeline developers; and That an investigation be conducted into the relatively high failure rate of new pipelines Greg Yost, who volunteers for Alliance To Protect Our People And The Places We Live (APPPL) is strongly against gas pipelines due to the dangers of leaked methane emissions, which occur throughout the process of fracking and transporting shale gas. The FERC allowing such high returns creates a situation where investors flock to build pipelines in areas where there is no justification for such a project. Such overbuilding will create a scenario where ratepayers will see increases in their utilities as companies attempt to recoup lost capital. How This Project Could Harm Communities The ACP is currently scheduled to route through Robeson, North Carolina, which is home to the Native Lumbee Tribe. The tribe is currently pushing for federal legislation granting full recognition to the North Carolina Lumbee Tribe. The tribe has a rich history, with over 55,000 members living in North Carolina, making the tribe the largest in the nation east of the Mississippi River and the ninth largest in the United States. The tribe could face the same challenges that caught international attention at Standing Rock, North Dakota. Olivia Neeley, a journalist for the Wilson (North Carolina) Times, recently spoke to several members of her community after members began speaking out against the construction of the ACP. Members of the Wilson community also believe there could be major environmental, safety, and water quality risks. Many residents along the proposed pipeline route depend on well water, which comes from groundwater. Local Resistant To The Pipelines APPPL Logo The APPPL organized The Walk To Protect Our People And The Places We Live, which took place in the middle of March of this year. The APPPL is planning to resist the construction of the pipeline throughout the entire process until it is defeated. Along with the environmental concerns, Greg is also worried about the economic future of North Carolina if the ACP is constructed.

During the abbreviated cleanup, a total of 1,200 gallons of oil was allegedly recovered from the river. At the peak of the cleanup effort, a spokesman for the company that operates the Poplar Pipeline said that oil was being recovered at the rate of one teaspoon every ten minutes. At that pace, it would have taken 1,753 years to remove all the oil from the river. Federal regulations require that pipelines be buried only four feet underneath rivers despite evidence that large rivers like the Yellowstone can scour 40 feet deep during floods and ice jams. January 24, 2015 Nearly a week has passed since an oil pipeline ruptured underneath the bed of the Yellowstone River in eastern Montana, contaminating drinking water supplies for the 6,000 residents of Glendive, sickening several people, and taking an unknown toll on fish and wildlife. Oil recovery efforts have been hampered due to the fact that the Yellowstone River in the vicinity of the spill is locked under two feet of ice. Meanwhile, an oily sheen has been spotted as far down river as Williston, North Dakota. The city is expected to lift its bottled water order this weekend. Bridger Pipeline LLC has a long history of pipeline safety violations. According to the Pipeline Safety Trust, the company has double the average number of pipeline safety incidents per mile of pipeline over the past six years. It is unknown at this point whether the section of pipeline that ruptured under the Yellowstone River was of this variety. The last time this pipeline was inspected was in 2012. Meanwhile, as this oil spill tragedy continues to unfold, the U.S. Senate is debating a bill to approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which would cross the Yellowstone River approximately 20 miles upstream of the spill site. On the other side of the capitol, the U.S. House passed legislation on Wednesday that would expedite the approval of new natural gas pipelines, giving government regulators less time to evaluate their potential environmental impacts.

Other actions are also being planned, from a public interest group that has signed up hundreds of volunteers to canvass signatures for citizen-drafted legislation to block the pipeline to a group that is working to train its members on how best to physically block construction. The Kinder Morgan pipeline will not be built. Trudeau said the approval of the project was the best option for all Canadians. Texas-based energy infrastructure company Kinder Morgan said in a statement that it was excited to move forward with the project. Construction is expected to begin in 2017 and the pipeline could be in service by late 2019. Some two years ago, as Kinder Morgan crews began carrying out survey work for the proposed expansion, the grand chief was among the more than 100 people arrested during a days-long protest. A well-respected First Nation elder and a group of retired seniors from number of churches were also among those detained, he said. Since the government announced its decision, the team at West Coast Environmental Law has fielded a steady stream of phone calls from First Nations groups curious about the possibility of legally challenging the project. Of the 120 aboriginal groups consulted by Kinder Morgan, just 39 have written letters of support for the project. The Kinder Morgan project is already facing seven legal challenges, said Jessica Clogg of the organisation, with more expected in the coming weeks. Despite being approved by the previous Conservative government in 2014, the proposed northern BC pipeline was the target of 18 court cases. In June a Canadian court overturned the approval of the project after finding the government had failed in its duty to consult with indigenous peoples. For those opposing Kinder Morgan, she said, the lesson to be gleaned from the decade-long battle against the Northern Gateway project was clear.

The rise in installations was caused by a rapid decrease in the cost of solar panels and unprecedented consumer demand, according to Andrea Luecke, president and executive director of The Solar Foundation. The National Solar Jobs Census 2016, the seventh annual report on solar employment issued by the foundation, says installed solar capacity is projected to grow a record 14 gigawatts in 2016, almost double the 7.5 GW growth experienced in 2015. With such a gain, solar will likely exceed all other sources of new electric generating capacity for the year, according to the report. The solar jobs census follows a U.S. Department of Energy study released last month that found more Americans work in solar than at natural gas or coal power plants. The DOE report says 187,117 workers are employed at coal, oil, and natural gas power plants compared to nearly 374,000 people in the solar industry. The latest solar job numbers are significant. Still, the National Solar Jobs Census 2016 documents the dramatic growth of an industry in less than a decade. However, the growth in residential and commercial capacity deployment may offset utility-scale job losses, according to the report. A few more highlights: One out of every 50 new U.S. jobs was in the solar industry. Solar industry employment growth outpaced that of the overall U.S. economy by 17 times as it increased by over 51,000 jobs, for a total of 260,077 U.S. solar workers. The number of solar jobs increased in 44 of the 50 states in 2016. California employs the most solar workers, followed by Massachusetts, Texas, Nevada, and Florida. Workers who install rooftop solar panels make up the largest share employment in the sector at 137,133 jobs. SolarCity, which merged with Tesla (tsla) in 2016, Vivint Solar, and Sunrun (run) are the biggest residential installers. Manufacturing is a distant second with 38,121 jobs, followed by 34,400 in project development, and 32,147 in sales and distribution.

The London-based energy company said it couldn't quantify how much oil has spilled in the area, because it was still too dangerous for workers to approach the well. Attempts to stop the leak have failed so far. BP and state and federal authorities continued work on Sunday to try to get a handle on the situation. So far there have been no injuries or reports of harm to wildlife in the area, according to BP. The leak from the well, located on the frozen tundra of the North Slope, was discovered Friday morning when employees saw crude oil spraying out of the top of it. Natural gas was also being released uncontrollably. Authorities said they don't yet know what caused the well to discharge oil and gas. Responders attempted to bring the well under control at the start of the weekend, but the operation failed because of damage to a well pressure gauge, the Alaska Department of Conservation said. That movement caused the pressure gauge to break off and prevented operators from pumping anything down into the well in an attempt to seal it off. The oil giant has had several spills and leaks in Alaska over the years. A 2006 spill due to a corroded pipeline released almost 4,800 barrels of crude, making it the worst oil spill on the North Slope up to that point in time. A 2009 pipeline problem at a BP oil field in the state released almost 1,100 barrels of oil; that rupture and spill was a violation of the Clean Water Act, which meant BP had breached the terms of its plea agreement for the 2006 accident. In more recent years, BP has faced intense scrutiny over its role in the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 workers and created the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. federal waters.

The oil has leaked onto agricultural land, but the government said it has not infiltrated water sources. The recent spill happened on reserve land owned by the Ocean Man First Nation and covered a 66-foot radius. Some 52,834 gallons of oil spilled. Related: Major oil spill 150 miles away from DAPL protest validates Standing Rock concerns With multiple pipelines in the area, the government is uncertain which was responsible for the spill. They think the source could be a pipeline owned by Tundra Energy Marketing Limited (TEML), so the company is leading clean-up efforts. So far 170,000 liters, or around 44,909 gallons, have been recovered, according to the government, which also said wildlife and air quality have not yet been harmed by the spill. The pipeline was reportedly shut down as soon as the breach was found. But some people wonder if the spill was already underway before the government was made aware of it. Ocean Man First Nation chief Connie Big Eagle said one band member, a longtime oil industry employee, smelled a strange odor near the site of the spill.

Donald Trump will enter the White House with an environmental policy agenda opposed to that of the Obama administration and many other nations that have pledged support to the Paris climate agreement. The Washington Post's Chris Mooney breaks down what a Donald Trump presidency will mean when it comes to climate change. A slew of Obama administration policies on fossil fuels are expected to be reversed after Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20. Oil and gas favorites have been nominated to lead the Cabinet agencies that regulate the industry: former Texas governor Rick Perry as energy secretary, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as EPA administrator and Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-Mont.) as interior secretary. Energy executives are advising Trump in more informal ways, including Harold Hamm, a billionaire who heads the major oil producer Continental Resources, and Carl Icahn, a billionaire investor who owns a pair of oil refineries. Caption The men and women the president-elect has selected for his Cabinet and White House team. Scott Gottlieb, nominee for commissioner of FDA President Trump is set to nominate Scott Gottlieb, a conservative physician and businessman with deep ties to the pharmaceutical industry, to be commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, a White House official said. Trump transition officials did not respond to several requests for comment. After doing so, he left, he said. Pyle is not a paid lobbyist, but he once was one for Koch Industries, the oil and gas company owned by Charles and David Koch, who have funded a wide array of libertarian groups and think tanks. Pyle also has worked for American Energy Alliance and its sister group, the Institute for Energy Research, both with strong ties to the oil industry. While it is not clear whether these policies can revive the sagging U.S. industry, which faces significant global market pressures, it could boost domestic energy production broadly and translate into higher carbon emissions. Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute, said it was not just a matter of policy. Yet the oil and gas industry fared reasonably well. Obama did not move to curtail shale oil and gas drilling and lifted the 40-year-old oil export ban. And industry executives have had ready entree. Tillerson, for example, met with half a dozen or more of the most senior White House officials early in the administration, and he continued to meet others later. Catanzaro could not be reached for comment Wednesday. They include an Interior Department restriction on the flaring of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, during oil and gas operations on federal land. The department also issued a five-year leasing plan that bars drilling in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas off Alaska, as well as in waters off the southeast Atlantic coast. All of these measures could be overturned, either through the Congressional Review Act, which allows a congressional majority to vacate a regulation within 60 legislative days of it being issued, or through other means. The industry may expect favorable treatment from the Trump administration and congressional Republicans after heavily supporting their campaigns.

The construction of the pipeline would destroy Sioux historical and sacred sites, while the pipeline itself would put the drinking water of 18 million people at risk of contamination. This pipeline was originally routed through Bismarck, a predominantly white community, but due to concerns around drinking water contamination, it was re-routed to travel just upstream of Sioux territory, instead endangering the drinking water of Indigenous people, prompting many to call this an act of environmental racism.

A large oil refinery along the Athabasca River near Fort McMurray in Alberta's oilsands. Canada's oilsands risk becoming economically unviable as the world shifts to ride-hailing and electric vehicles, a new report says. Ride-sharing services like Uber will become more affordable than personal car ownership relatively soon, according to a report from Stanford University lecturer Tony Seba. As ride-hailing becomes more popular, more companies will jump into the market, making it more competitive. That, in turn, will convince ride-hailing companies to switch to driverless cars, making ride-hailing even more affordable. Uber and Lyft are already working on driverless car technology, as are Apple and Google's parent company, Alphabet. The auto manufacturing industry, including the General Motors plant in Oshawa, Ont., could come under severe pressure in the age of ride-hailing. Meanwhile, the costs of manufacturing combustible-engine cars will start going up, as they become less common. Auto manufacturing will collapse by 70 per cent between 2020 and 2030, the report predicts. The number of cars in the U.S. will plummet from 247 million to 44 million in the same period. It will become next to impossible to sell a used fossil-fuel car, the report predicted. And the decrease in transportation costs will save households so much money it will be like a 10-per-cent pay raise, the report estimates. Ivan Glasenberg, CEO of Angle-Swiss commodity company Glencore, says the electric car revolution is happening faster than people think. The argument that this seminal shift in transportation will show up earlier than thought is gaining in popularity. Ivan Glasenberg argued there is plenty of opportunity for natural resource economies in the world of electric cars, which use batteries that require copper, nickel and cobalt. He noted that sales of alternative-fuel cars in Europe were up 36 per cent in the first quarter of this year.

Another analysis of pipelines owned by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) and Sunoco (which is now owned by ETP), found an average of one spill incident every eleven days since 2002. ETP is the company behind the Dakota Access pipeline, which sparked the iconic Indigenous-led resistance at Standing Rock. But it gets worse. Massive new oil pipelines do the exact opposite. They help expand the production and consumption of fossil fuels, locking us into higher emissions and increasing our addiction to oil at precisely the time we need to be scaling down the fossil fuel industry and its infrastructure through a just transition to renewable energy. Because of these and other concerns, many Indigenous communities are opposing plans to build new pipelines through their territories. Indigenous Land and Water Protectors are leading the growing movement against pipelines and for a better future for us all. Rather than owning up to its issues and working to address them, the pipeline industry has been using nefarious tactics to silence and undermine those standing up for Indigenous rights, a sustainable economy, and a healthy environment. But the movement has not been deterred. The many beautiful and inspiring examples of people fighting back against the oil industry could fill a entire book. The building of the Watch House was followed by mass peaceful civil disobedience against the Kinder Morgan pipeline, which has resulted in about 200 people being arrested since March, including grandmothers and grandfathers, Greenpeace co-founder Rex Wyler, and two sitting Members of Parliament. In 2016, this iconic resistance movement drew global attention to the misdeeds of the pipeline industry. The lawsuit is aimed at silencing critics and driving a wedge between Indigenous Water Protectors and allies such as Greenpeace. This tactic has failed, and both Greenpeace and the wider movement have redoubled support for Indigenous-led pipeline resistance. Here too, Indigenous people are leading the fight. Indigenous Water Protectors and allies have been peacefully putting themselves in the way of construction to stop this harmful project from going ahead. Read a personal account here.

What began as a legal battle to halt construction has grown into an international movement headquartered on an 80-acre campground in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Without a guarantee that the pipeline will be halted, the community plans to remain permanently, even with winter approaching. North Dakota became an epicenter of the recent United States oil boom after drillers began using relatively new fracking techniques to extract oil from the region in the late 2000s. Lacking any infrastructure to transport the oil, drillers proposed the Dakota Access Pipeline, which will carry more than 20 million gallons of crude oil daily from the Bakken region of North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa before connecting to an existing pipeline in Illinois. Pipelines are not without risks. Since 2010, over 3,300 incidents of crude oil and liquefied natural gas leaks or ruptures have occurred on U.S. pipelines. They also released toxic, polluting chemicals in local soil, waterways, and air. Over 1,000 of these incidents occurred on pipelines carrying crude oil. However, in an SEC filing from earlier this year, oil from the pipeline is now slated for export. This reversal comes on the heels of the December 2015 Congressional agreement to lift the 40-year ban on exporting domestically produced oil. Situated in the Black Hills of North and South Dakota and along the Missouri River, the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation is the sixth-largest reservation in the U.S. by land area (3,600 square miles), with a population of 8,000. The pipeline is being constructed by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) and Houston-based investors Enbridge Energy Partners. From 1999 to 2010, Enbridge was responsible for 804 oil spills, dumping 5 million gallons of oil into the environment, including the largest onshore oil spill in U.S. history. The tribe believes the Corps failed to conduct thorough cultural and historical reviews before granting federal approvals for construction. Here, the population is 75 percent American Indian, with an average per capita income 65 percent below the national average. Although the pipeline route does not directly cross the reservation, the tribe is voicing concerns about potential damage to recently discovered burial sites on land that has been taken away unjustly over the past 150 years. The pipeline also poses environmental risks, such as drinking water contamination in Lake Oahe and the Missouri River. The Missouri River is the longest river in the U.S. and forms the fourth-largest river system in the world.

From civil disobedience to coordinated efforts to shut down pipelines carrying tar sands oil to the United States, environmental activists are standing in the way of delivering energy that could help the rest of the world, said Russ Girling, president and CEO of TransCanada Corporation, the developer of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline. The heads of three major North America pipeline companies convened Wednesday evening at the annual CERAWeek energy conference to discuss the trials and tribulations of building pipelines in an era in which the public has been awakened to the impacts of fossil fuel extraction and consumption. Opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline project, whose route ran near the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, became a focal point of opposition for Native Americans across the country. Both are members of the Catholic Worker movement, founded by famed peace and justice activist Dorothy Day. That quickly changed as Energy Transfer Partners gained the support of state law enforcement in North Dakota and police agencies across the country that traveled to Standing Rock camp to violently suppress the protests against the pipeline. The company also used intimidation tactics against opponents. As the protests at Standing Rock grew, the company sent in private security contractors who used pepper spray and attack dogs on pipeline opponents. Energy Transfer Partners hired TigerSwan, a private security firm, to oversee protection of the pipeline project. As a U.S. military contractor, TigerSwan turned its military-style counterterrorism tactics against Dakota Access protesters. The company later paid TigerSwan for information that was used to file a conspiracy against environmental groups. TigerSwan did this by infiltrating the protest camps and activist circles and gathering information via fake social media pages. After climate crackdown, TransCanada scraps major tar sands pipeline Blame (or thank) Canada's regulatory board. During the CERAWeek panel discussion, Warren admitted that his company monitors social media. Sunoco Pipeline is owned by Energy Transfer Partners. In January, Pennsylvania regulators also ordered Sunoco Pipeline to suspend construction of its Mariner East 2 pipeline system. The massive cross-state project has been plagued by drilling spills and water contamination. Prior to joining Kinder Morgan, Kean served as chief of staff to Ken Lay, the disgraced founder of Enron Corp. who was found guilty of breaking several laws, including 10 counts of securities fraud, that contributed to the downfall of the company. Once that happens, we need to abide by it and honor it. Prior to this decade, the energy industry was unaccustomed to public involvement in a regulatory process that they viewed as a domain it could control. Then came the crackdown. Girling also emphasized that the pipeline industry must support regulators at the federal and state levels. The pipeline industry views the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as a friendly agency, given its history of rubber-stamping energy infrastructure projects. But Girling was pleased to see that climate and anti-pipeline activists are getting convicted."}, {"URL": "http://www.valleynewslive.com/content/news/You-could-face-a-1000-fine-for-sending-supplies-to-DAPL--403638516.html", "Timestamp": "20180919005058", "Sentences": "Stick with Valley News Live on this and all other stories regarding the Dakota Access Pipeline."}, {"URL": "http://act.climatehawksvote.com/calpers_divest_from_dapl?recruiter_id=1834313", "Timestamp": "20180918233726", "Sentences": "In the process of construction, Energy Transfer Partners has already damaged numerous sacred sites and would drill under the Missouri River, the sole drinking water source of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

Transcript DOERING: From PRI, and the Jennifer and Ted Stanley Studios at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, this is Living on Earth. But it also lies along the route that would bring oil drilled in North Dakota to export terminals on the Gulf of Mexico. DOERING: Since the Trump Administration gave the green light to the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners has been working hard to get the Bayou Bridge pipeline across the Atchafalaya built. But a federal judge in Louisiana recently ordered a temporary stop to the pipeline construction, following a court challenge by several environmental groups. KAISER: Here to tell us more is Anne Rolfes, the founding director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. Thanks for having me. ROLFES: Well, the judge agreed that there is a risk to the Atchafalaya Basin that is serious enough to warrant Energy Transfer Partners halting construction of this pipeline. She agreed with the plaintiffs that this pipeline could do irreparable harm. KAISER: So, I mean I do understand that the Army Corps of Engineers gave the Bayou Bridge pipeline its seal of approval some months ago. Now, the judge has ordered this temporary stop because of environmental concerns. An eighteenth-century map of the Atchafalaya Basin. (Photo: Stuart Rankin, Flickr CC BY-NC 2.0) ROLFES: What should have happened from the beginning is that the Army Corps of Engineers should have conducted an Environmental Impact Statement, to really assess what the impacts are along the route. You have drinking water threatened in one area, you have black bear habitat threatened in the basin. You have a community, a historic African-American community, threatened in the community of St. James Louisiana. And the Army Corps of Engineers by refusing to conduct an Environmental Impact Statement didn't acknowledge that. KAISER: So, I understand that as well as some environmental groups, local fishermen are concerned about the construction of the pipeline. Tell me more about that. ROLFES: It's a really wonderful assortment of opposition. You have people in the western part of the state, in Calcasieu Parish, who are concerned about the impacts on their land. I mean, these are ordinary people who happen to own land along the pipeline route, and Energy Partners has seized that land and the people have no power to stop them. You continue down the route and you have indigenous communities that are concerned about the impacts to drinking water, and then if you continue you hit the Atchafalaya Basin where the crawfishermen make their living from the basin. There are wild crawfish there still, and the problem with a pipeline like the Bayou Bridge pipeline is that it acts as a dam and restricts water flow. The water dies, essentially, and then all of the living creatures within that water also die, and so in our case the pipeline restricts water flow, and the crawfish die. And if you're not from Louisiana you might not understand how significant crawfish are to us, but culturally they are a lynchpin for us and at this time of year, the spring is the time of year where we eat crawfish. KAISER: I am one of those people who has never been to the Atchafalaya Basin. I imagine a lot of our listeners have never been there. ROLFES: Yeah, one of the crawfishermen has described the basin as his Yellowstone, and if you think about the magnitude of the national parks that people might be more familiar with, Yellowstone or Glacier or the Smokies to the east, it's that magnitude of natural significance. And so what you see is, you see placid water, flat water, brown, maybe dark green water and you see these beautiful cypress trees and moss hanging down from them, you'll see alligators swimming around. Once night falls you'll start to see frog eyes if you shine a light. So, it's teeming with life. KAISER: So, the pipeline would run through 162 miles of the state, part of it would be sitting right in the water. ROLFES: What we see the impacts of oil spills to be, and we know because we see them all the time, is that they kill the wildlife and they kill the natural world. So, for example, we're having these water protector trainings, and I was speaking with a crawfisherman at one of those trainings and he said he can already see from past oil skills that our red fish population has gone down in areas and that our crabs have also died off. And so this has been a long assault on the state of Louisiana by the oil industry. KAISER: So, the pipeline is being sold as providing jobs and energy independence to the state. So, the fact that our governor and our elected officials are peddling this pipeline is laughable because they're not even hiring people from our state. And then energy independence, I mean, that's hot air also because certainly some of this oil will be for export. Anne Rolfes is the Founding Director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. ROLFES: Yeah, let me just say this because I don't want people to get...before I answer that, I don't want people to get depressed about this fight because it is a great moment in Louisiana. Just yesterday we were out on the pipeline route, we stood in front of backhoes, we stopped their construction. We prevented that backhoe from grabbing a pipe that they were trying to grab and from laying in the ground. So, there is a lively resistance here where you have people who are willing to take action, 50 of us as happened yesterday stood in the way of a backhoe. That hasn't happened here before, and the oil industry ought to be scared, they ought to realize that it's a different day, and that they will have trouble on their hands. And the next steps are, of course, that Bayou Bridge has furiously filed motions to vacate the judge's ruling, and so it's just a matter of waiting, and you know waiting for decisions. KAISER: Anne Rolfes is a Founding Director of the environmental group, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. Ann, thank you so much for coming on the program today. ROLFES: Oh, my pleasure, I'm glad to be here. We intend to seek immediate relief from this decision in the appropriate courts. Beyond that, we will decline to comment on the legal process, but instead defer to our filings. It is important to clarify that construction of this important infrastructure project continues in all other areas along the route.

And it seems to me that the very least DEP could do is dedicate a portion of that to obtaining an independent risk assessment of Mariner East II, or even support our effort do so. Our residents and their families deserve to know and thoroughly understand the risks and potential safety issues at stake. There is no reason why the administration cannot bridge that gap. Residents are concerned regarding the potential impact of a leak or explosion in places where the pipeline is recklessly sited next to schools, daycares, senior living facilities, and homes. The Governor has failed to keep the project halted, and has failed to address the potential risks this project poses. This enabled them to use eminent domain to coerce us and others throughout the state to sign easements for construction of Mariner East pipelines. These pipelines are scheduled to pass through our property, disrupting our lives, destroying our landscape, and posing chronic danger. NGLs are liquid only under very high pressure or extremely cold temperatures. Sunoco has violated regulations and agreements, damaged homes, created sinkholes, contaminated aquifers and wells, and disrupted wetlands. The danger of major explosions looms as millions of gallons of hazardous, highly volatile liquids flow near homes, businesses, schools, and recreation facilities on a daily basis. No county is more at risk than Chester County. Much of route through Chester and Delaware counties would be considered Class 4 High Consequence Areas by Natural Gas standards. This liquid state is a higher energy state containing more combustion energy than the ambient state these gases have in the natural environment. If leaked, highly condensed liquids rapidly convert back to a gas, expanding by hundreds of times in volume into a highly explosive gas cloud. These gases are naturally odorless, colorless, and heavier-than-air. The heavier-than-air characteristic allows these gases to migrate in unpredictable ways that are highly dependent on wind conditions and topography. The gases, being heavier-than-air, remain low to the ground, will settle in low lying areas, can enter sewer systems or porous rock and use them as conduit to migrate indeterminate distances from a leak site. The model focuses on the heavily populated segment between the pumping station in Derry Township, Dauphin County, PA and the pipeline terminus in Twin Oaks, Delaware County, PA. Methane Natural Gas hazards model is shown for reference and comparison throughout the modeling process. Quest ran several simulations of ME2 pipeline ruptures using liquefied Ethane as the piped material. This 25-acre area surrounding the leak would be inaccessible until the jet fire was extinguished. Because these materials are artificially liquefied within the pipe, any leak will continue even after valve stations close and isolate the leak site. Therefore, any jet fire will continue until the gas fully self-ventilates and there is not more fuel to burn. With 800 to 1,200 tons of material condensed within each 6-mile long segment between valve stations, the time to fully extinguish a jet fire an access people within the 25-acre jet fire affected area would likely be measured in hours, likely many hours. Data obtained from an independent hazards study performed by Quest Consultants using ethane at 2 local operating pressures was used to correlate the Instant Ignition model. These local pressures represent the operating pressure of the pipeline at the simulated location of rupture accounting for pressure dropping at a steady rate as the material gets farther from the pump. The large variance is apparent even at lower operating pressures, demonstrating that severity is more sensitive to the highly condensed liquid state than to pressure itself. While higher pressure does show increased severity, there is a sharp increase in severity at the operating pressure at which each material converts from gas to liquid. This sharp severity increase correlates well with the density vs. pressure curve for each material. However, the pipeline operator claims that they are not using the Berks County pumping station. Because of this uncertainty, the model was run both ways. This characteristic means that these materials, when converted back to a gaseous state outside the pipeline, will remain close to the ground and have the potential to migrate. Data from the Quest hazards study was also used to model a 3-minute delayed ignition leak scenario. local pressure trends were then input into the 3-Minute Delayed Ignition PIR model to obtain the Delayed Ignition PIR for Ethane along the entire ME2 segment, with Methane Natural Gas Instant Ignition PIR shown for reference. Another factor that contributes to the unpredictability of these gas migration patterns is the presence of sewers, ventilation, and other systems that can serve as conduit for the gas to spread out. The heavier-than-air nature of these gases means that it will flow downhill but also down into these open-air systems that are below grade (ground level). Karst, a highly porous rock formation, is prevalent in the Uwchlan area providing additional underground passageways that can allow released gas to spread randomly throughout the surrounding areas. This size radius has been used in remote locations where there likely are few underground open-air systems. In a densely populated area with a vast network of sewers (both storm water and septic), an equivalent evacuation would be far more complex. example is illustrated in the middle of Delaware County.

This isn't about politics but rather doing what is right. That issue was not raised or decided in the case cited by Judge Burr. Moreover, a recent landmark case decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania known as Robinson IV affirmed the right of townships like Middletown to adopt municipal ordinances in the interest of the health, safety and welfare of their residents.

The work is associate with the Mariner East pipeline but is not the actual pipeline location. They are directionally drilling the pipeline under Chester Creek. The operation includes the pumping of bentonite ( a slurry made of clay and water ) to fill any voids created by the drilling.

And it seems to me that the very least DEP could do is dedicate a portion of that to obtaining an independent risk assessment of Mariner East II, or even support our effort do so. Our residents and their families deserve to know and thoroughly understand the risks and potential safety issues at stake. There is no reason why the administration cannot bridge that gap. Residents are concerned regarding the potential impact of a leak or explosion in places where the pipeline is recklessly sited next to schools, daycares, senior living facilities, and homes. The Governor has failed to keep the project halted, and has failed to address the potential risks this project poses. This enabled them to use eminent domain to coerce us and others throughout the state to sign easements for construction of Mariner East pipelines. These pipelines are scheduled to pass through our property, disrupting our lives, destroying our landscape, and posing chronic danger. NGLs are liquid only under very high pressure or extremely cold temperatures. Sunoco has violated regulations and agreements, damaged homes, created sinkholes, contaminated aquifers and wells, and disrupted wetlands. The danger of major explosions looms as millions of gallons of hazardous, highly volatile liquids flow near homes, businesses, schools, and recreation facilities on a daily basis. No county is more at risk than Chester County. Much of route through Chester and Delaware counties would be considered Class 4 High Consequence Areas by Natural Gas standards. This liquid state is a higher energy state containing more combustion energy than the ambient state these gases have in the natural environment. If leaked, highly condensed liquids rapidly convert back to a gas, expanding by hundreds of times in volume into a highly explosive gas cloud. These gases are naturally odorless, colorless, and heavier-than-air. The heavier-than-air characteristic allows these gases to migrate in unpredictable ways that are highly dependent on wind conditions and topography. The gases, being heavier-than-air, remain low to the ground, will settle in low lying areas, can enter sewer systems or porous rock and use them as conduit to migrate indeterminate distances from a leak site. The model focuses on the heavily populated segment between the pumping station in Derry Township, Dauphin County, PA and the pipeline terminus in Twin Oaks, Delaware County, PA. Methane Natural Gas hazards model is shown for reference and comparison throughout the modeling process. Quest ran several simulations of ME2 pipeline ruptures using liquefied Ethane as the piped material. This 25-acre area surrounding the leak would be inaccessible until the jet fire was extinguished. Because these materials are artificially liquefied within the pipe, any leak will continue even after valve stations close and isolate the leak site. Therefore, any jet fire will continue until the gas fully self-ventilates and there is not more fuel to burn. With 800 to 1,200 tons of material condensed within each 6-mile long segment between valve stations, the time to fully extinguish a jet fire an access people within the 25-acre jet fire affected area would likely be measured in hours, likely many hours. Data obtained from an independent hazards study performed by Quest Consultants using ethane at 2 local operating pressures was used to correlate the Instant Ignition model. These local pressures represent the operating pressure of the pipeline at the simulated location of rupture accounting for pressure dropping at a steady rate as the material gets farther from the pump. The large variance is apparent even at lower operating pressures, demonstrating that severity is more sensitive to the highly condensed liquid state than to pressure itself. While higher pressure does show increased severity, there is a sharp increase in severity at the operating pressure at which each material converts from gas to liquid. This sharp severity increase correlates well with the density vs. pressure curve for each material. However, the pipeline operator claims that they are not using the Berks County pumping station. Because of this uncertainty, the model was run both ways. This characteristic means that these materials, when converted back to a gaseous state outside the pipeline, will remain close to the ground and have the potential to migrate. Data from the Quest hazards study was also used to model a 3-minute delayed ignition leak scenario. local pressure trends were then input into the 3-Minute Delayed Ignition PIR model to obtain the Delayed Ignition PIR for Ethane along the entire ME2 segment, with Methane Natural Gas Instant Ignition PIR shown for reference. Another factor that contributes to the unpredictability of these gas migration patterns is the presence of sewers, ventilation, and other systems that can serve as conduit for the gas to spread out. The heavier-than-air nature of these gases means that it will flow downhill but also down into these open-air systems that are below grade (ground level). Karst, a highly porous rock formation, is prevalent in the Uwchlan area providing additional underground passageways that can allow released gas to spread randomly throughout the surrounding areas. This size radius has been used in remote locations where there likely are few underground open-air systems. In a densely populated area with a vast network of sewers (both storm water and septic), an equivalent evacuation would be far more complex. example is illustrated in the middle of Delaware County.

This isn't about politics but rather doing what is right. That issue was not raised or decided in the case cited by Judge Burr. Moreover, a recent landmark case decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania known as Robinson IV affirmed the right of townships like Middletown to adopt municipal ordinances in the interest of the health, safety and welfare of their residents. Coalition for Community Safety calls upon the PA-DEP to revoke the prematurely issued water obstruction and encroachment permits. The work is associate with the Mariner East pipeline but is not the actual pipeline location. They are directionally drilling the pipeline under Chester Creek. The operation includes the pumping of bentonite ( a slurry made of clay and water ) to fill any voids created by the drilling. The slurry apparently followed a fracture in the rock under the area and started to bubble out in the area of 5005 and 5007. The work is to clean up and remove the slurry.

But Energy Transfer Partners -- who have pinned their hopes on Trump reverse the Army and permitting their pipeline -- maintained that this fear was misplaced and that there were no real risks to their proposition. Yesterday, we learned that the Belle Fourche Pipeline had spilled at least 176,000 gallons of crude oil into Ash Coulee Creek, 150 miles from Cannon Ball, ND, where the water protectors made their stand.

Suess said the spill migrated almost 6 miles from the spill site along Ash Coulee Creek, and it fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. The creek feeds into the Little Missouri River, but Seuss said it appears no oil got that far and that no drinking water sources were threatened. The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over. About 60 workers were on site Monday, and crews have been averaging about 100 yards daily in their cleanup efforts, he said. Some of the oil remains trapped beneath the frozen creek.

According to the Huffington Post's Jonathan Cohn, Trump's Department of Health and Human Services has already submitted a list of rule changes to the Office of Management and Budget, which has to approve them before the lengthy public process required to rewrite a regulation can start. Advertisement Under Obamacare's current rules, insurers are only allowed to charge seniors up to three times more than younger adults. This is called the age-rating band, and it generally makes coverage cheaper for the older customers and more expensive for the young. They also claim that would lead to a better functioning insurance market overall. Trump can't expand the age band that far without legislation. But he's going to try to widen it a bit. Here's Cohn (bolding mine): Insurers would have more leeway to vary prices by age, so that premiums for the oldest customers could be 3.49 times as large as those for younger customers. Today, premiums for the old can be only three times as high as premiums for the young, which is what the Affordable Care Act stipulates. Top Comment Funny. I am a pretty big fan of the Chevron principle, which says courts should generally defer to executive agencies when it comes to statutory interpretation. But man does this stretch credulity. I'm not even saying it's necessarily bad policy; insurers have had trouble enrolling enough young folks to stabilize the Obamacare markets in many states and, who knows, maybe a more flexible band would help a little. But the legal justification is just priceless. Anyway, to whomever came up with this: Your fifth grade math teacher should be beaming.

This decision is the result of a new kind of environmental activism that treats energy pipelines as a chokepoint for activities that contribute to global warming, and builds alliances with other groups to stop them. They have sought tougher fuel efficiency standards and mandates for electricity companies to use of renewables in electricity generation. Sometimes they have lobbied customers, hoping that they will sanction firms for bad policies. Energy companies have often blocked or weakened regulatory action. It has often been hard to mobilize consumers, who are addicted to automobiles and energy intensive lifestyles, and believe that they have little power over markets. Their objective is to prevent the fossil fuel industry from accessing the pipelines and railroad networks they need to move their products. The logic is simple; if products cannot be moved, they cannot be sold and will not contribute to global warming. Instead, it leverages the existing regulatory framework. Environmentalists have built coalitions with actors that are more interested in local issues than in global climate change. These actors fear that transportation of fossil fuels might contaminate their water resources, infringe on their fishing rights, or desecrate their sacred lands. Native American nations are an especially attractive ally, because they often have treaty rights over land and water use that the U.S. government is obliged to take account of. Environmentalists are allying themselves with Native Americans This explains the fight that is happening right now in North Dakota. It also explains why environmental groups have struck up alliances with Native American nations and tribal groups to disrupt the transportation of oil and coal elsewhere. Take the case of the Gateway Pacific Terminal at Cherry Point, Washington. This was supposed to be the largest coal exporting facility on the West Coast, allowing the export of coal mined in the Power River Basin in Montana and Wyoming. Environmentalists collaborated with The Lummi Nation, which believed that the Cherry Point terminal would adversely impact its fishing investments (for reference, the Lummi nation owns the largest native commercial fishing fleet in the U.S.). Importantly, the Lummi Nation had leverage because it had signed a treaty with the federal government in 1855 that guaranteed its rights to fish in the Salish Sea. In 2015, the Lummi Nation filed a petition with the Army Corps of Engineers claiming that the proposed terminal would damage its fishing and desecrate its sacred sites. This saw them opposing another Native American tribe, the Crow Nation in Eastern Montana, which partnered with Cloud Peak Energy to develop a coal mine on its land, but which did not have the advantage of a treaty. The Army Corps of Engineers ruled in favor of the Lummi Nation. Similarly, in 2015, the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community sued BNSF in federal court to stop the transportation of Bakken crude oil through its lands. The Quinault Indian Nation, in collaboration with environmental groups, has successfully challenged the granting of a permit for the Grays Harbor Terminal as well as Imperium Bulk Liquid Terminal Facility in Hoquiam, both in Washington state. The Keystone XL fight is really about Albertan tar sands Pipeline politics also explains the enormous controversy over the Keystone XL pipeline, where environmentalists have made the running through the Department of State rather than alliance with Native Americans. This pipeline sought to transport crude oil extracted from Canadian tar sands to refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast where it could be refined and exported overseas. Because the Keystone XL pipeline crosses international borders, it requires TransCanada, the parent company, to apply for regulatory permission from the U.S. Department of State. There is no evidence that building a new oil pipeline would create a big new environmental problem in itself. After all, the United States already has the largest pipeline network in the world: 1.2 million miles for natural gas, and 150,000 miles for petroleum products. In comparison, the Keystone pipeline is only 1,700 miles long. Environmentalists are fighting Keystone because it will be far harder for oil companies to make use of the Alberta tar sands without the pipeline. Since these tar sands are among the largest oil reserves in the world, this could have a massive secondary impact on global warming. The coal industry is facing another challenge. Because the current system has many veto points, this has led them to think creatively about whether choke points elsewhere in the system can be exploited.

Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., voting in favor, alongside every Republican. That bill was in response to what are known as budget reconciliation instructions, a Senate maneuver that allows legislation to go through the full Senate with a bare majority and not be subject to a filibuster. The state has a permanent fund that is fueled by resource extraction, which cuts an annual check to state residents, so Alaskans are quite literally bought into the fossil fuel industry.

It's been estimated that today more than 15 million Americans live within one mile of oil and gas development. The drilling process, of course, has the potential to emit toxic substances, including the carcinogen benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and diesel exhaust, into the surrounding air and waterways. But researchers have long been trying to determine to what extent oil and gas drilling operations may threaten public health, particularly around cancer risk. However, new research suggests that children living in areas of high-density oil and gas development may face increased risk of health impacts, namely a certain type of leukemia, as a result of their exposure to pollutants associated with this activity. In some parts of Colorado where oil and gas development is especially concentrated, hundreds of oil and gas wells reportedly lie within one mile of residential areas. And according to a recent study, children and young adults who were diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia were 4.3 times more likely to live within 10 miles of an active oil and gas well than kids with other types of cancer. This finding, published in the scientific journal PLOS One, applied to youth between 5 and 24 years old. The study did not find a connection between other types of cancer, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and proximity to oil and gas wells. While oil and gas development can and does happen in urban areas (see: Los Angeles), McKenzie's team limited their research to Colorado's small towns and rural areas with populations under 50,000 people. They used data collected by the Colorado Central Cancer Registry to find more than 740 young Coloradans under 24 years old who were diagnosed with cancer between 2001 and 2013. In order to analyze these children's proximity to oil and gas development at diagnosis, the researchers then employed information from the Colorado Oil and Gas Information System to determine both the coordinates of all oil and gas wells in rural Colorado and timing when each well was active. The study team notes in the PLOS One paper that environmental factors such as pollution from oil and gas wells are unlikely to fully explain incidence of cancer on their own, but that they are a significant influence: A number of factors, including genetic predisposition and susceptibility, as well as environmental factors, come together in the development of childhood cancers through a two step process, the first of which likely occurs in utero. McKenzie and her co-authors called for more research to confirm their findings, recommending that those studies take into account nuances such the type and level of oil and gas development and production, the amounts of benzene and other pollutants and pollutant levels at locations such as schools and childcare facilities.

Florida Reps. A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies. Macrophages, which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body, protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles. The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants. That's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA's Office of Inspector General (OIG), the agency's internal watchdog. EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement, and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency.

RELATED: Oil Flows Through Dakota Access Pipeline, But Resistance Will Continue The Belle Fourche crude oil pipeline spilled an estimated 12,615 barrels of oil, more than the December estimate of 4,200 barrels, spokeswoman Wendy Owen told reporters last week. The spill is the second-largest crude spill in the state in more than 15 years, behind a 20,600-barrel leak by a Tesoro Logistics L.P. pipeline in 2013, according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Oil from the pipeline leaked into the Ash Coulee Creek and on a hillside. Around 80 percent of the cleanup is complete, Owen said, noting the incident occurred following ground movement. The pipeline operator has collected around 3,900 barrels of oil from the creek by skimming and vacuuming, Owen said and added that no oil moved further down the creek which feeds into the Little Missouri River and eventually flows into the Missouri River, a major source of drinking water. The North Dakota Department of Health has not yet completed a subsurface investigation on the hillside affected by the leak to confirm how much oil remains, agency program manager Bill Seuss told reporters Friday. The spill was not originally detected by monitoring equipment, raising fears that the technology deployed by companies, contrary to their claims, is not sufficient to prevent contaminations.

Just days into his presidency U.S. President Donald Trump signed executive orders paving the way for the Dakota Access pipeline and TransCanada Corp's Keystone XL to continue their construction.

Fortunately, Turner told The Star that he did not think the spill would impact wildlife. No fish deaths have yet been reported, and it is too early in the year for migratory songbirds to have arrived, he said. The spill traveled four miles before it was stopped by the booms. Marathon was moving the fuel from its refinery in Robinson, Illinois to its terminal on the Ohio River in Mount Vernon, Indiana. Turner told The Star that efforts were now underway to recover the fuel, a process that should take about a week. He expected 60 percent of the diesel to be skimmed. According to The Star, this is not the first time that a Marathon pipeline has leaked. In April 2016, 48,300 gallons of oil spilled into the Wabash River from a pipeline near Mount Carmel, Illinois near the Indiana border. That leak was caused by the fact that erosion had exposed the pipeline, which had been buried beneath the river, to the river bottom itself. Marathon spokesperson Shane Pochard told The Star that the cause of the current spill is unknown but investigations are underway with help from the Indiana Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety. The spill comes as pipelines are under increasing scrutiny in North America. Indigenous groups and environmental activists ramped up protests this week against the proposed Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline extension from the Alberta tar sands to Vancouver, BC. In 2017, environmental groups sued the Trump administration over the president's decision to approve the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, reversing the decision by former President Barack Obama to cancel the project. And, according to The Intercept, the Dakota Access pipeline, which was the subject of massive protests by the Standing Rock Sioux and their allies, leaked five times in 2017. In 2016, Undark reported that there had been more than 1,300 crude oil spills from pipelines in the U.S. since 2010, averaging one every other day. While pipelines lead to fewer spills than transporting oil by rail, the other overland option, the Congressional Research Service, the U.S. State Department, International Energy Agency and the Fraser Institute found that pipeline spills release more crude into the environment, Business Insider reported.

Florida Reps. A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies. Macrophages, which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body, protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles. The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants. That's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA's Office of Inspector General (OIG), the agency's internal watchdog. EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement, and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency.

President Donald Trump announces the Keystone pipeline approval, calling it an historic moment for North America. The president made the announcement at the White House. He was accompanied by the president of TransCanada Corp., the Calgary-based pipeline company that has wrestled with lawsuits, resistant landowners, protesters and Washington Democrats. The presidential approval doesn't guarantee the pipeline gets built. The removal of one big obstacle in Washington still leaves several sprinkled around the American Midwest, where opponents still hope to trip up the project with protests and lawsuits. The likely epicentre of the coming battle is Nebraska, the very place where opposition to Keystone began years ago. TransCanada (TSX:TRP) must still reach deals with some landowners there, it lacks a state permit and faces possible court challenges there and in South Dakota. The markets demonstrated their skepticism by yawning at Friday's news: TransCanada's share price barely budged, and in fact even declined a bit by late-afternoon, retaining a value similar to October before Trump was elected. Keystone opponents swiftly linked their cause to the broader anti-Trump movement. Trump, meanwhile, has been eager to talk about projects like Keystone. His young presidency has been consumed by problematic issues lately: a failed health reform and Russian election-meddling. Even as he made the Keystone announcement, reporters in the Oval Office shouted questions about the collapse of his health bill. At that same moment, networks were carrying a congressional committee announcement that Trump's former campaign manager would be questioned in its Russia probe. Trump says he wants to move onto jobs and the economy. Keystone XL would mean thousands of temporary construction jobs and a permanent, annual boost in tax revenues for communities along the route, which would stretch from Canada to an already completed southern portion now pumping oil to refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. It's unclear if construction could start this year. The Nebraska permit alone could take up to eight months, said Canada's Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr. He welcomed the U.S. announcement, but pointed out the process is far from over. He declined to say whether a completed Keystone would enter the calculus of whether the country needs another, larger project from TransCanada. Carr said the Energy East plan to move oil to the Atlantic Coast is undergoing an independent review. U.S. regulators conducted their own, favourable reviews before politicians stepped in. American government studies concluded that the pipeline would have negligible impact on the environment -- and potentially even a beneficial one, as a cleaner alternative to oil transport by rail. But opponents disputed the conclusion. They pointed to the worst-case scenario calculated by U.S. regulators, and argued that it's actually becoming reality -- that if oil prices remain low, and no other pipelines get built, Alberta oilsands expansion would slow, and emissions would drop, without Keystone. Hearing this pressure from the political left, Barack Obama rejected the project. In response, TransCanada filed a challenge under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, alleging the U.S. government breached its legal commitments under NAFTA. That challenge has been dropped, TransCanada said Friday. Republicans had repeatedly promised to reverse Obama's decision. That included Trump, who had often discussed the Keystone approval as a fait accompli, telegraphing intentions that the market received long ago. Statement by Chelsie Klassen, spokesperson for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers: The White House approval of the Keystone XL (KXL) Pipeline Project is a major step for Canada, the United States and North American energy security. The Canadian oil and natural gas industry has been facing challenges to maintain competiveness at home and abroad, but pipeline approvals such as the KXL approval today, advance opportunities to make Canada an attractive place for investment. This announcement means responsibly-produced Canadian oil will have access to more markets, which means Canadians will be getting better value for their resources."}, {"URL": "http://act.climatehawksvote.com/calpers_divest_from_dapl?recruiter_id=2016840", "Timestamp": "20180918233254", "Sentences": "In the process of construction, Energy Transfer Partners has already damaged numerous sacred sites and would drill under the Missouri River, the sole drinking water source of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

Projects: Worldchanging; Carbon Zero; Heroic Future; The Nearly Now. American journalists, pundits and media executives have largely convinced themselves that climate change is not a serious political issue, because they think the polls tell them that. Trump has surrounded himself with more oil industry and oil industry connected people than any president in history (even George W. Bush). Climate change threatens to undermine civilization itself (Credit:Pixabay) Again, the American media has failed to convey the magnitude of the costs of unchecked global warming. Those costs are profound already, today, as the Arctic heatwave, Syrian civil war, bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, worsening storms, droughts, wildfires and freak weather events all show. Those costs will only grow, and they will grow more dire, more quickly as the planet heats. At the same time, the innovations we need to create zero-carbon prosperity are already here. From plummeting costs for solar, wind, electric vehicles and green buildings to better approaches to urban planning, agriculture and forestry, we already have the tools we need to start building a much more prosperous world, producing hosts of new companies and millions of jobs. Indeed, a giant building boom is what successful climate action looks like. But some people totally understand: the ones who stand to lose money from these changes. Even if we act decisively now, we will be wrestling with the impacts of that pollution for centuries. So one half of our task is to become zero-carbon societies, but the other is to ruggedize in the face of worsening problems, in many cases by abandoning places that cannot be saved and practices that cannot be continued. Climate action will trigger an enormous shift in the way we value things. Currently, though, these assets are valued very highly. Oil is seen as hugely valuable, coastal real estate is seen as hugely valuable, industrial patents are seen as hugely valuable. It is still growing. People whose job it is to measure risk in financial markets are extremely concerned about the magnitude of the Carbon Bubble and the damage it will do as it bursts. Because when it bursts, trillions of dollars of imaginary assets will simply vanish in a very short time. Mark Carney thinks the Carbon Bubble is extremely dangerous. Scores of experts warn that the Carbon Bubble is one of the biggest threats to the global economy. The way to increase the resilience of global markets, they say, is to act on climate, but to do so with bold-yet-predictable pacing. Climate action will stave off financial disaster as well ecological catastrophe. This is a win-win for everyone, except those heavily invested in those Carbon Bubble assets now. For these investors, the Carbon Bubble is a good thing: the longer it lasts, the more they reap the benefit of high valuations and large dividends. For them, the larger the Carbon Bubble swells, the more money they make. The Perception War There is no long game in high-carbon industries. Their owners know this. All they need is the perception of the inevitability of future profit, today. The value of oil companies will collapse long before the last barrel of oil is burned; the value of beachfront hotels will collapse long before rising tides flood their lobbies. Put another way: The pop comes when people understand that growth in these industries is over and that, in fact, these industries are now going to contract. As investors begin to flee these companies, others realize more devaluation is on the way, so they want to get out before the drop: a trickle of divestment becomes a flood and the price collapses. What triggers the drop is investors ceasing to believe the company has a strong future. Because that risk already exists, the pop is way closer than most people understand. You would ally with extremists and other sources of anti-democratic power, in order to be able to fight democratic efforts to cut emissions through the application of threats, instability and violence. For oil and gas companies, this means new exploration and new pipelines. Two reasons: First, it sends a signal of confidence to markets that you expect to continue to grow in the future. This, too, bolsters investor confidence. (Note that whether these assets are eventually abandoned or not is of little concern to current investors looking to delay devaluations). Rex Tillerson and Vladimir Putin (Wikimedia Commons) Trump wants ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be his Secretary of State. You might remember that Exxon has been a main driver of climate denialism, as well as being one the largest polluters in history. Tillerson also has close ties with Vladimir Putin. Think that one over. Trump has also put forward a host of other appointees who are overt climate denialists and generally also have financial ties to industries threatened by the Carbon Bubble. If you were going to ask why a country like Russia would risk a war to interfere with American politics, look at what the Russian economy is. Those oil and gas assets are controlled by a small number of oligarchs gathered around Putin, the former head of the KGB. Those oligarchs may be the one group of investors who stands to lose the most from the popping of the Carbon Bubble. Now, add in all the other Bubble-expanding projects and ploys, pipelines and hotels, and you begin to see the magnitude of the scam here. The difference between the Carbon Bubble deflating rapidly now and popping spectacularly in a decade or more could mean literally trillions more dollars in profits for the kind of people now helicoptering into Washington. But that same delay would also bring on climate catastrophe, damage our democracy and bring financial ruin for the investors who are left holding those assets when the bubble pops. It is not hyperbole to say that swelling the Carbon Bubble is not only not in the interests of the United States, it increases threats to our economy and national security, puts Americans at risk, undermines our prosperity and weakens our nation. It sounds like a conspiracy theory, frankly, because we are so cognitively unprepared to see the Bubble in front of us. That we are so blind to these risks is a tragedy.

That same month the federal government released permits for the controversial Site C dam in B.C., despite strong opposition from local First Nations. Of the 120 First Nations consulted by Kinder Morgan, only 39 have issued letters of support for the project. The company has not secured the consent of two-thirds of potentially impacted Indigenous nations to go ahead with the project. Tsleil-Waututh, Squamish and Musqueam First Nations have mounted considerable opposition to the project, including threats of legal action and Standing Rock-inspired blockades to prevent its construction. Of course, there are many arguments deployed by governments and corporations to justify this neglect. But those are the terms articulated by former primer minister Stephen Harper, a leader representing a political vision Trudeau was ostensibly elected to remedy. As Trudeau famously said: governments grant permits, communities grant permission. The ad-hoc review panel formed to fix that was riddled with alleged flaws including a lack of clarity in mandate, failing to reach out to participants, organizing meetings during the summer when many people were away and appointing a panel chair who had a previous business relationship with Kinder Morgan. The truth is that two-thirds of impacted Indigenous nations do not want the Kinder Morgan project threatening their lands and waters with potential oil spills, destroyed marine mammals and catastrophic climate change. This is a truth that our elected officials are aware of, but seem not to care about. The federal government could have called off the review process until the reviews of the NEB, Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency and the Fisheries Act were completed. The Alberta NDP could have recognized that the oilsands can not be expanded further without the free, prior and informed consent of impacted Indigenous nations, choosing instead to clearly articulate to constituents and industry why it would not be petitioning for federal approval. But despite all this, Indigenous nations do not back down. A new indigenous coalition created to fight fossil fuel expansion, the Treaty Alliance Against Tar Sands Expansion, now has over 100 Indigenous nations and organizations on its list of signatories.

One change was to require that all legacy oil sites continue to report spills of 1 barrel and above unless they upgrade the sites with modern containment berms and other safeguards. The Northwest Landowners Association, which represents 500 farmers, ranchers and property owners, plans to continue opposing the bill when it's under consideration by the Senate, said Chairman Troy Coons. The landowners would like to see the bill become law, but they prefer that oil companies report all spills that are above 1 barrel, or 42 gallons, regardless of the location of the spill, Coons said. Supporters of the bill say reporting small spills that are contained to sites designed to protect the environment is an administrative burden on the state. But there was no fiscal note with the bill so it's unclear what cost savings the bill would provide. Oil and gas field inspectors do not immediately respond to a spill of 10 barrels or less that is contained on site, Ritter said. During routine inspections, staff check on possible spills to ensure they have been cleaned up, she said. The North Dakota Department of Health would not be affected by the bill because the agency does not respond to spills contained to oilfield sites."}, {"URL": "https://www.rt.com/usa/378155-fracking-oil-spills-study", "Timestamp": "20180918233603", "Sentences": "Hydraulic fracking requires fluids to be injected at high pressure into a drilling pipe to crack rocks and release oil.

Sign up This sits poorly with traditional economic thinking, which assumes corporations face competitive markets or, even without competitive markets, the threat of market entrants. One of the characteristics of neoliberal economics has been the effort of neoliberals to justify diminishing competition as firms grew bigger. Neoliberals justified mergers and acquisitions that created giant, market-dominating corporations as achieving huge efficiencies and savings that would flow through to consumers. The reality, of course, was very different. The major banks have wielded political power to protect their own interests. The royal commission has only really detailed what we have long known was happening for more than a decade: the conflict of interest inherent in this vertical integration model has harmed consumers. The commission is normally willing to grasp the nettle and criticise politicians, albeit indirectly, but the political dimension to market power has eluded it on banks. Any assessment of the market power of the banks is inadequate without an assessment of the political dimension of that power, and the way in which it has been used to benefit banks and harm consumers.

It's been estimated that today more than 15 million Americans live within one mile of oil and gas development. The drilling process, of course, has the potential to emit toxic substances, including the carcinogen benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and diesel exhaust, into the surrounding air and waterways. But researchers have long been trying to determine to what extent oil and gas drilling operations may threaten public health, particularly around cancer risk. However, new research suggests that children living in areas of high-density oil and gas development may face increased risk of health impacts, namely a certain type of leukemia, as a result of their exposure to pollutants associated with this activity. In some parts of Colorado where oil and gas development is especially concentrated, hundreds of oil and gas wells reportedly lie within one mile of residential areas. And according to a recent study, children and young adults who were diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia were 4.3 times more likely to live within 10 miles of an active oil and gas well than kids with other types of cancer. This finding, published in the scientific journal PLOS One, applied to youth between 5 and 24 years old. The study did not find a connection between other types of cancer, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma and proximity to oil and gas wells. While oil and gas development can and does happen in urban areas (see: Los Angeles), McKenzie's team limited their research to Colorado's small towns and rural areas with populations under 50,000 people. They used data collected by the Colorado Central Cancer Registry to find more than 740 young Coloradans under 24 years old who were diagnosed with cancer between 2001 and 2013. In order to analyze these children's proximity to oil and gas development at diagnosis, the researchers then employed information from the Colorado Oil and Gas Information System to determine both the coordinates of all oil and gas wells in rural Colorado and timing when each well was active. The study team notes in the PLOS One paper that environmental factors such as pollution from oil and gas wells are unlikely to fully explain incidence of cancer on their own, but that they are a significant influence: A number of factors, including genetic predisposition and susceptibility, as well as environmental factors, come together in the development of childhood cancers through a two step process, the first of which likely occurs in utero. McKenzie and her co-authors called for more research to confirm their findings, recommending that those studies take into account nuances such the type and level of oil and gas development and production, the amounts of benzene and other pollutants and pollutant levels at locations such as schools and childcare facilities.

A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies. Macrophages, which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body, protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles. The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants.

This particular pipeline was built under the Missouri River, which is the primary water source for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Recent Oil Spills in North Dakota It goes without argument that oil pipelines are less secure than the companies building them want us to believe. Furthermore, because spill detection technology is somewhat lacking, many of the 745 leaks in North Dakota last year resulted in substantial contamination. For example, in December 2016, nearly 530,000 gallons of oil leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline in Billings County. The leak contaminated private land, US Forest Service grazing land, and Ash Coulee Creek. This was just 2.5 hours from Standing Rock. A landowner notified them when he stumbled upon the leak. Clearly, an important disconnect exists. This prompted a town to shut down drinking water service to 6,000 of its residents. Rather than dismissing these two examples as isolated incidents, consider the following. The New York Times reports that between 2006 and 2014, more than 1,300 oil pipeline spills occurred in North Dakota. In 2006, over one million gallons leaked out into the county of McKenzie. The same county experienced a leak in 2014 with another 1,008,000 gallons of oil spilling into the environment. Consequently, it is clear why protesters and landowners are concerned about the structural integrity of oil pipes. Oil leak examples presented in this article are not unique.

The company remains barred by regulators from reopening the pipeline until the company submits plans for further tests and evaluations.

He claims to be an environmentalist, but is having his government buy and build a 600-mile oil pipeline and oil port that will send 34 tankers a month through sensitive marine waters shared by Washington and British Columbia. The government will then spend taxpayer money -- billions of dollars of it -- to complete the pipeline and oil export port. The project will triple, to 890,000 barrels of oil a day, the capacity of the existing TransMountain pipeline. The oil will be exported by tanker through sensitive marine waters shared by Canada and the United States.

It is still small enough that it is safe to consume. City officials are currently unsure if the increased levels of hydrocarbons in the water supply are from the recent oil spill in Glendive, Montana, or if they water has been tainted from a different source. Last week, a pipeline owned by Bridger Pipeline LLC ruptured and released an estimated 40,000 gallons of oil into the Yellowstone River. The spill occurred about 50 river miles away from North Dakota where the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers meet. After the spill, Glendive officials shut down the water treatment plant and measured hydrocarbon contents at levels of 15 parts per billion (ppb). In Williston, the highest readings reached 3.39 ppb and have been dropping since the measurement was taken. The state cut off level for hydrocarbon content in water is five ppb. It takes about two days for water to travel from the water treatment plant to the tap. The odor, coming days after the spill in Glendive, could be the culprit. However, officials are still uncertain if the spill in Glendive is the cause. The EPA is reporting that no oil has come into North Dakota so officials are unable to assume the spill is to blame. Although Tuan said the state may not find the culprit of the spike, the treatment plant will continue monitoring the distribution system to ensure its safety. Williston Mayor Howard Klug said the state is extremely concerned about the effects of the spill and the quality of drinking water. The Herald reports that Governor Jack Dalrymple spoke with Klug and said the state is actively helping the city. The Department of Health, which has about five employees in the area to assist with testing, will aid the city to ensure all complaints are properly addressed.

Now they are watching the Belle Fourche pipeline, which recently leaked roughly 180,000 gallons of crude into the Ash Coulee Creek in far western North Dakota. The leak was discovered Dec. 5, and authorities say there is no threat to drinking water and that the crude is 100 percent contained. The Two-Way Pipeline Protesters, Battered By Blizzard, Vow To Stay But cold weather is slowing down the 140 or so workers on the scene cleaning up the mess, according to pipeline company spokeswoman Wendy Owens. The leaking segment of the pipeline was built in the 1980s. Since then, construction materials and pressure monitoring equipment have improved, and tighter regulations have been put in place. Enlarge this image The weather has hindered efforts to clean up at the Belle Fourche pipeline spill site. Since 2010, according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, operators have reported about 200 crude oil spills per year, on average. The Belle Fourche pipeline leak is the largest in North Dakota since 2013. But the same company that owns and runs the pipeline was involved in another oil spill in Montana in 2015 that leaked 30,000 gallons of crude into the river. At one point, tests showed traces of oil in the local drinking water. Still, generally these incidents are low probability, high impact events, and John Stoody with the Association of Oil Pipelines says they remain the most efficient way to go. The data to back up that claim are kind of tricky to pin down. But when you compare crude transportation by pipeline versus crude transported by rail, pipelines appear safer. That's because while pipelines spill about 50 percent more than trains, they move more than three times as much crude. Those who have been protesting the Dakota Access pipeline worry that safety equipment won't detect a leak, and this recent spill gives them pause because it wasn't pipeline safety equipment that detected 180,000 gallons crude leaking out of the pipeline, but a local landowner.

The spill contaminated a hillside and Ash Coulee Creek about 16 miles northwest of Belfield in southwest North Dakota. An earlier estimate put the spill at 4,200 barrels, or 176,400 gallons, but was revised after the company was able to pinpoint when the spill started and review metering data, said Owen. Cleanup crews continue to be on site, where traces of benzene have been detected throughout the creek, which flows into the Little Missouri River, said Bill Suess, spill investigation program manager for the North Dakota Department of Health. Meet the guy behind the gruesome, knee-buckling Class B state title celebration An oil sheen has been detected in the creek but did not appear to reach the river, Suess said. Health officials continue to collect water samples from the creek and the river as they oversee cleanup efforts. The segment of pipeline was isolated and shut down. The company estimates that 4,000 barrels, or 168,000 gallons, have been recovered through skimming operations. Contractors also have performed 1,200 burns on top of the creek to recover oil, ranging from a few minutes to all-day operations, Suess said. The landowner reported losses of cattle he attributes to the spill, but he did not agree to medical testing to confirm the cause of death, Suess said. The cause of the spill is still under investigation. The pipeline leak occurred in a hillside that is slumping, which is the company's leading theory of what caused the break, Owen said. Weather conditions and the instability of the rugged Badlands terrain have slowed cleanup efforts and prevented crews from doing much work in the hillside. Some oil continues to discharge from the hillside into the tributary of Ash Coulee Creek, Suess said. Crews hope to do more analysis of the hillside in the next month, Suess said. The health department has issued a notice of violation for the spill, but has not yet proposed a fine. In the past, regulators have had a difficult time accessing information about the root cause of major spills. The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued a corrective action order in late December. The Environmental Protection Agency also is monitoring cleanup. The revised spill estimate makes the Belle Fourche Pipeline spill one of the largest in North Dakota's record of tracking oil spills. The largest oil pipeline spill on record is the 2013 Tesoro Logistics spill discovered in a farmer's field near Tioga involving an estimated 20,600 barrels, or 865,200 gallons. That spill contaminated groundwater and cleanup efforts are ongoing. The state also has had larger pipeline spills involving produced water, a waste byproduct of oil production.

He had previously criticized the company the last time it was before the commission, according to local media. Epping Transmission wants to a pipeline that would deliver 30,000 barrels of oil per day to the Dakota Access pipeline terminal. Summit Midstream Partners is under investigation by the North Dakota Industrial Commission which says the 2015 leak continued for more than three months before the spill was discovered.

In recent summers crop artists had cut anti-XL artworks into the outlying corn fields, and in 2014 Neil Young and Willie Nelson headlined a protest concert on the field the XL is set to cross. It may have taken years, but the former president eventually paid attention. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Art and Helen Tanderup stand by a large Cowboys and Indians alliance sign on their corn farm outside of Neligh, Nebraska. Photograph: Laurence Mathieu-Leger for the Guardian As Art says, the state of Nebraska, and more precisely its Public Service Commission, stands as the last major obstacle to TransCanada and the new president from getting shovels in the ground. Public hearings are set for August, and Tanderup and a coalition of other resistant landowners are preparing to lobby hard. Pipeline map The suggested route has already been moved once, back in 2012, to avoid the fragile ecosystem of the Nebraska Sandhills. But the new route still crosses the massive underground aquifer, and the Tanderups maintain their sandy, porous soil means their land should still be considered part of the Sandhills region. At present, around 90 landowners along the proposed route are holding out against the Canadian company as eminent domain will not be enforceable unless the plan is approved. They plan to sue if it is. But fear is coupled with frustration under this new administration. The president had already formalised this requirement by executive order. Along the route, countless local business owners and politicians have touted these claims as the dominant factor guiding their support for the construction. You may be able to prolong it. They will have to bulldoze me over before they can come on my property. Art Tanderup But the reality is different. There will be an additional 26,000 jobs created indirectly by the project. Pivotally, almost all of these positions are temporary, projected to last two years at most. Estimates suggest just 50 permanent jobs will be created by the construction. TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said the company agreed with the state department projections. A meeting memo, seen by the Guardian in the town of Baker, Montana, showed TransCanada did not provide firm estimates to town officials over the number of local people who would be offered work by the pipeline. It also shows that, despite continuing legal battles and ongoing route proposals in Nebraska, TransCanada have briefed officials they could start construction on a number of pump stations along the route in 2018, with a view to pipeline construction between 2019 and 2020.

A decade ago the first Keystone pipeline passed close to this area, and Priefert recalls fondly how it led to jobs in a town where the population has declined by half since the Rock Island railroad closed up. The line, forever enshrined by the eponymous folk spiritual later performed by Johnny Cash and Lonnie Donegan, had kept a regional headquarters here until the 1970s. She knows from experience that the expected boom here will be not permanent and expresses a general unease over the Trump presidency, despite voting for him in 2016.

The village, named after former railroad president Dudley M Steele upon foundation in 1873, has a population of just 56 people and is eerily quiet.

In 2012, President Barack Obama toured the TransCanada Stillwater Pipe Yard in Cushing, Okla. (AP file) As one of the first acts of the 114th Congress, Republicans are committed to passing a bill that would permit construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada through the United States. As the showdown plays out, we wanted to answer to three key questions you might have about the Keystone XL proposal. SUPPORT POLITIFACT'S KICKSTARTER TO LIVE FACT-CHECK THE 2015 STATE OF THE UNION. The 875-mile Keystone XL pipeline would carry heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to Steele City, Neb. Then, it would connect with an existing southern leg that opened in early 2014, delivering more than 800,000 barrels of oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Extracting this type of dirty, thick crude oil is energy-intensive and produces a significant amount of carbon emissions. Critics say that Keystone XL will elevate greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change by encouraging expansion of the tar sand development. Also, if it leaks, the oil is corrosive and difficult to clean up. In other words, the pipeline would not significantly contribute to carbon pollution -- Canadian officials and oil producers vow that the oil will be extracted and reach the American marketplace by other means. In short, the State Department expects that the project would only result in only a few permanent jobs that last past construction. Many proponents, like TransCanada CEO Russ Girling, say the project will create 42,000 jobs. The State Department report does puts the total number of jobs at 42,100 -- but the definition of a job in this sense is a position filled for one year. This total reflects both jobs created directly as a result of construction and manufacturing for the pipeline -- about 3,900 annual positions over two years -- as well as spin-off jobs supported by construction workers who purchase materials for the project or spend their wages in the economy. Much of the construction work would come in four- or or eight-month stretches. We rated that statement False. Based on the State Department report, we also rated that claim False. The construction phase, though, is expected to take only one to two years. After construction, the pipeline would employ a lesser number, primarily for maintenance. The total number of long-term jobs: about 50. Help fund PolitiFact's Kickstarter to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union and GOP response.

U.S. officials on Monday, Nov.21, 2016 announced a ban on new mining claims across more than 30,000 acres in the area. The Trump administration can overturn much of the current protections on public lands. Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin (R) is one potential candidate for Secretary of the Interior. She met with President-elect Donald Trump on Monday in New York. In a sea of Trump-allied fossil fuel supporters, Fallin stands out as a particularly pro-oil type. She also signed a bill banning local governments from restricting oil and gas drilling. Numerous Oklahoma outlets have blamed the governor for failing to address the causal relationship between oil extraction and earthquakes. The process creates huge amounts of wastewater, which is injected underground for storage. Advertisement Another candidate for the position, Rep. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) has a stunningly low lifetime environmental record score of 5 percent from League of Conservation Voters. Lummis is reportedly meeting with the president-elect Tuesday. This is a woman who, along with many of her Republican colleagues, voted to block any efforts to increase the amount taxpayers are compensated for oil drilling on public land. Those votes do not portend a strong position of protecting public lands or even getting fair market value for their extractive possibilities. Other candidates for the position reportedly include former Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AK); former Gov. Jan Brewer (R-AZ); Harold Hamm, an Oklahoma billionaire; and Forrest Lucas, an oil executive. Advertisement The Interior Department oversees all of that. It also contains the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the U.S. Geological Survey. Under the Obama administration, the department has maintained oil and gas leasing on public lands and in the Gulf of Mexico, allowed oil leasing in the Arctic, and toyed with allowing drilling in the Atlantic, off the southeastern states. But Obama has also presided over a huge preservation movement, dedicating millions of acres as national monuments. In January, Obama announced that there would be no new coal leases on public lands. That does not seem to be the approach of the Trump administration, given both the names floated for secretary and the transition team itself, which is being led by Doug Domenech. Advertisement Domenech is a former deputy chief of staff at the department and a former Virginia secretary of natural resources.

Oil-soaked ducks and geese from around the water source were gathered by zoo officials to be cleaned and treated. The fracture of the Chevron pipeline sent oil gushing into the riparian corridor, leaving the thick, tacky substance clinging to rocks, soil and any fish and birds in its path. The creek that runs through his backyard and normally gives him such delight instead swamped the morning air with a horrible smell. Even as the BP Gulf Coast oil tragedy and its stumbling cleanup efforts continue to dominate the news, Salt Lake City awakened Saturday morning to its own ecological disaster winding its way through Salt Lake neighborhoods and turning Liberty Park into a command center. Where children would normally play and chase ducks, those same waterfowl were coated with the gooey substance, helplessly trying to groom the oil off themselves. The birds will either remain at the zoo for the time being or go to a wildlife rehabilitation center. The all-day effort tapped specialists with the state Division of Wildlife Resources and the state agriculture department. Pipeline fracture The pipeline fracture most likely happened at about 10 p.m. Friday on the south side of Red Butte Creek. The 10-inch-diameter line runs down Emigration Canyon to the company's refinery near Beck Street, carrying medium crude oil from western Colorado and eastern Utah to the Salt Lake Valley. Chevron reported receiving high and low pressure alarms Friday evening, but the nature of the alarm did not give a location that would pinpoint the trouble. Just before 7 a.m. Saturday, however, Salt Lake police and fire received reports of petroleum odors near the Veterans Administration facility on 500 S. Foothill Drive. It was then that the crude oil was discovered in Red Butte Creek, with 50 to 60 gallons gushing into the stream every minute. Crews reached the shutoff valve seven miles upstream from the leak at 7:45 a.m. By 11:20 a.m., the spill was at 20 to 25 gallons per minute. In the meantime, crews hastily issued a warning for residents to stay away from Red Butte Canyon and shut down Liberty Park for the day, where a command center replaced afternoon recreation. A handful of residents began making phones calls to emergency dispatchers, concerned about the petroleum odor wafting into the air. A persistent rainfall left over from Friday's night's thunderstorm helped clear the air of the stink, and as news briefings continued throughout the day, the calls tapered off, said Salt Lake Fire spokesman Scott Freitag. A construction crew in the neighborhood began using its heavy equipment to help dam the stream in early efforts to stanch the flow, Freitag said. Crews are using absorbent booms and creating dams in an effort to contain the spill, but some oil has already leaked to the Jordan River. He, like others, was grim-faced about the urgency of what needs to happen this weekend and the work that will continue in the days ahead. Early on, city officials stressed that the city's culinary water system was not impacted by the spill and that household water is safe to drink. The vitality of the aquatic wildlife, birds and vegetation that depend on Red Butte Creek is another matter. Employees with the state Division of Water Quality spent Saturday sampling the water from the creek just below the spill, downstream through Liberty Park and where the stream discharges into the Jordan River. The immediate goal, of course, is to clean up the spill and save the wildlife from its impacts, noted Dan Griffin, an environmental engineer for the agency and permit writer. Oil affects the natural water resilience of waterfowl and contaminates moss and algae, which are then consumed by animals and fish, Griffin said. The severity of the spill, Griffin said, is not to be taken lightly. The state is likely to issue a notice of violation to Chevron for the discharge, Griffin said, and a settlement will include costs to cover the cleanup. That is a process that could take months to complete as the investigation unfolds. Full responsibility An EPA investigator is also probing the impacts of the spill and will help kickstart any cleanup efforts that merit federal intervention. A team of investigators from Chevron is arriving in Salt Lake City from Houston, and a special hotline has been set up to field complaints or questions from residents. The number is 1-866-752-6340. Chevron spokesman Mark Sullivan said the company takes full responsibility for the spill and intends to cover all financial costs of the containment and cleanup. The pipeline was last inspected in 2008, he added, and showed no problems that would raise concern. Most pipeline fractures are due to water-caused corrosion, he said.

New pipeline, same issues As for the Keystone XL pipeline, it seems insane to go ahead with its construction with the knowledge that TransCanada was either obfuscating the dangers posed by its pipelines or has been grossly misunderstanding those dangers. It is also negligent to public health and safety to continue with the project when a high volume of ground-water exists along its approved route. Furthermore, as a strictly political concern, Keystone XL would unacceptably infringe upon the land-rights and spiritual concerns of native peoples along its path. The scope of the protests last November over another pipeline near Standing Rock reservation also in South Dakota show that American natives will not stand to have their rights be ignored.

Houston-based Kinder Morgan earlier halted essential spending on the project and said it would cancel it altogether if the national and provincial governments could not guarantee it. The court concluded the federal government failed in its duty to engage in meaningful consultations with First Nations before approving it. The court decision is a blow to Trudeau, whose government is having a bad week after Canada was left out of new free trade deal with the U.S. and Mexico. Talks to include Canada are now taking place in Washington. He said he expects the Kinder Morgan sale to be finalized on Friday and called it a good financial decision. He said the pipeline is critically important as Canada looks to diversify its oil exports. The pipeline would allow Canada to diversify oil markets and vastly increase exports to Asia, where it could command a higher price. The court decision is a victory for indigenous leaders and environmentalists, who have pledged to do whatever necessary to thwart the pipeline, including chaining themselves to construction equipment. The Trans Mountain expansion would cause tanker traffic to balloon from about 60 to more than 400 vessels annually as the pipeline flow increases from 300,000 to 890,000 barrels per day. Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee, an opponent of the project, said he was pleased that the court found there are serious impacts that have not yet been full considered. Many indigenous people see the 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) of new pipeline as a threat to their lands, echoing concerns raised by Native Americans about the Keystone XL project in the U.S. Many in Canada say it also raises broader environmental concerns by enabling increased development of the carbon-heavy oil sands.

The wells contaminate the quality of the air, water and soil and increase harmful toxins such as benzene and formaldehyde. People living within a mile of these toxic fumes have an increased risk for getting cancer, heart disease, dementia or a neurological problem. Residential proximity to these operations has also increased adverse birth outcomes, including pre-term birth, lower birth weight, neural tube defects and congenital heart defects. So pregnant women living near these wells could be putting their fetuses at an increased risk to have one of these defects. In the US, 17.6million people live a mile or closer to oil and gas wells. This is a picture of oil workers in Tioga, North Dakota. 'When one in two members of a population are potentially exposed to a health risk, that's a significant public-health concern,' Czolowski said. Other notable figures included 24 percent of Ohioans living near active wells and Texas having the highest number of residents near these harmful sites at 4.5million people. Researchers also looked specifically at children aged 5 or younger because of how vulnerable they are to environmental exposures. Acute exposure to these air pollutants can cause irritation in the eyes, nose, throat and lungs while causing chronic conditions for people around them long term. The study states that protective regulations and policies are necessary considering the large number of people exposed to these chemicals daily.

You can help by expanding it with reliably sourced entries. 1969: On October 25, a faulty pipe exploded in a gas line beneath Malton, Ontario. One person died, about 20 were injured, 9 stores and several homes were destroyed. 1997: On April 30, a rupture occurred on the Westcoast Energy Inc. 219.1-millimetre (8-inch) outside diameter Monias pipeline at Mile Post 20, near Fort St. John, British Columbia. The gas ignited immediately, resulting in damage to the surrounding soil and vegetation. 1999: On May 20, Line 3 on the Enbridge Pipelines Inc. (Enbridge) pipeline system ruptured, releasing 3 123 cubic metres (m3) (20,600 barrels) of Cold Lake heavy crude oil, east of Regina, Saskatchewan. 2000: On December 28, a release of natural gas resulted in an explosion that destroyed the electrical and services building, heavily damaged the compressor building, and damaged the remaining buildings at the East Hereford compressor station, approximately 80 km SE of Magog, Quebec. Before the occurrence, the station had been shut down since approximately 1004 due to an unintentional manual initiation of the station's emergency shutdown system. Following the emergency shutdown of the compressor station, a maintenance person was sent to the station to reinitiate the electric motor-driven compressor unit. During the day, after repeatedly trying to get the station into the ready state mode, to return the station to normal pipeline operations, an explosion occurred. 0.8 kilometres downstream of the Hardisty pump station near Hardisty, Alberta. The rupture occurred in a permanent slough that was fed by an underground spring. Although the line was shut down at the control centre in Edmonton, Alberta, within minutes of the rupture, the exact location of the rupture was not found until after 13 hours. Approximately 3800 cubic metres of crude oil was released and contained within a 2.7-hectare section. near Binbrook, Ontario. Line 10 transports crude oil from Westover, Ontario, to Buffalo, New York, United States. The rupture occurred in an agricultural field planted with soybeans. Within eight minutes of the rupture, the control centre operator in Edmonton, Alberta, shut the line down and began to sectionalize it. Remedial action response teams contained the spill to two general areas, a natural swale running perpendicular to the pipeline and the pipeline trench. Following the rupture, the sweet natural gas ignited. With the automatic closure of main-line valves upstream and downstream of the rupture site, the fire self-extinguished at 0230, on 15 April 2002. There were no injuries. 2002: A refined product pipeline rupture near Saint-Clet, Quebec, on Dec 7, from Trans Northern Pipelines Inc. 273.1 mm diameter mainline kilometer post 63.57, estimated 32 cubic meters of low sulphur diesel released to area and drainage systems. Transportation Safety Board Investigation Report Number P02H0052. 2003: A backhoe punctured a pipeline in Etobicoke, Ontario the resulting explosion killed 7 people 2005: On July 15, an employee of Terasen Pipelines (Trans Mountain) Inc. discovered crude oil on the pipeline right-of-way, on the north side of Ward Road, Abbotsford, British Columbia. Before the discovery, the company had been delivering crude oil out of the Sumas Tank Farm, when it received odour complaints from local residents. Approximately 210 cubic metres of crude oil was released into the surrounding area and made its way into Kilgard Creek. The rupture occurred in a wetland area of farmland. Approximately 990 cubic meters of crude oil were released, of which approximately 912 cubic meters were recovered. There were no injuries. 2007: On July 24, the 610-millimetre (24-inch) Westridge Dock Transfer Line, owned by Trans Mountain Pipeline L.P. and operated by Kinder Morgan Canada Inc., was struck and punctured by a contractor's excavator bucket while the contractor was excavating a trench for a new storm sewer line along Inlet Drive in Burnaby, British Columbia. When the pipeline was punctured, approximately 234 cubic metres of crude oil was released, approximately 210 cubic metres of which was recovered. Crude oil flowed into Burrard Inlet Bay via the Burnaby storm sewer system. Eleven houses were sprayed with crude oil; many other residential properties required restoration and approximately 250 residents voluntarily left their homes. There were no explosions, fires, or injuries resulting from this occurrence; however, emergency workers and two firefighters responding to the incident were sprayed with crude oil. 2009: A July 20 Alberta pipeline explosion & fire involved a TransCanada Corporation natural gas pipeline. The explosion, which sent 50 meter flames into the air, destroyed a two-hectare wooded area. The Peace River Mainline pipeline, built in 1968, had ruptured six times and leaked on 17 occasions until 2014. 2009: On 12 September 2009, TransCanada Corporation's Gas Control received notification, from the Englehart Fire Department through its Emergency Notification Line, of an explosion and fire south of its Compressor Station 107, located near Swastika, Ontario. At the time of the occurrence, TransCanada was transporting sweet natural gas. Escaping gas from a pipeline rupture had ignited, resulting in the explosion. A large crater was created and two sections of pipe broke from the system, with one section being ejected approximately 150 metres from the rupture site. 2009: On 26 September 2009, TransCanada Corporation's Line 100-1 ruptured, near Marten River, Ontario. At 1151, Gas Control at TransCanada's Calgary office became aware of this event when Main Line Valve 112-1, on the upstream side of Compressor Station 112, automatically shut off due to low pipeline pressure. At the time of the occurrence, TransCanada was transporting sweet natural gas. The escaping gas did not ignite. A large crater was created and pipe pieces were ejected from the failed pipeline section and spread around the occurrence site. 2009: On 29 September, an Enbridge crude oil pipeline, Line 2, leaked at Mile Post 474.7335, immediately downstream of the Odessa pump station near Odessa, Saskatchewan. There were indications of gouging associated with the dent. The release occurred in a low lying, densely vegetated marsh. Approximately 175 cubic meters of crude oil was released, of which most was recovered. 2009: A refined product pipeline rupture near Farran's Point, Ontario on Ottawa Lateral, on October 5, from Trans Northern Pipelines Inc. system, unknown petroleum product, unknown quantity. Transportation Safety Board Report Number P09H0086. Transportation Safety Board Report Number P10H0021. At the time of the occurrence, TransCanada was transporting sweet natural gas. Escaping gas from a pipeline rupture had ignited, resulting in the explosion. A large crater was created and three pieces of pipe broke from the system, with pipe and other debris being ejected up to 100 m from the rupture site. Six residents near the site evacuated until the fire was extinguished. 2011: In April, a pipeline break northeast of Peace River, Alberta, leaked 28,000 barrels of crude oil, Some wildlife was killed from the spill. 2012: On June 23, an ignition and fire occurred in a valve-enclosure structure at Spectra Energy Transmission Compressor Station N4, located approximately 160 km northwest of Fort St. John, British Columbia. Two maintenance employees sustained burn injuries when sweet natural gas that had been leaking from a station valve ignited. The 2 employees were performing annual inspection work on motor-operated valves. The injured employees were air-lifted to the Fort St. John Hospital. 2012: On June 28, a pipeline rupture and ignition occurred on Westcoast Energy Inc.'s 406.4 mm (16-inch) Nig Creek pipeline, located about 40 km northwest of Buick, British Columbia. Approximately 25 minutes later, a pipeline rupture and ignition occurred on Bonavista Energy Corporation's 168.3 mm (6.625-inch) pipeline installed nearby in the same right-of-way. At the time of the ruptures, both pipelines had been shut down and contained pressurized sour gas. The fire spread to adjacent forested areas. A large crater was created, and one piece of the Nig Creek pipe was ejected along with other debris to approximately 20 m from the rupture site. 2013: On October 17, a 36-inch natural gas pipeline ruptured southwest of Fort McMurray, Alberta. An estimated 16.5 million cubic meters of natural gas were released. The rupture did not result in a fire, there were no injuries and no evacuation was required. 2014: On January 25, a TransCanada Corporation gas transmission pipeline 762 mm (30-inch) Line 400-1 exploded and burned, near Otterburne, Manitoba, causing a natural gas shortage in Manitoba and parts of the United States. Natural gas burned for approximately 12 hours. Five residences in the immediate vicinity were evacuated, and Provincial Highway 303 was closed until the fire was extinguished. 2014: In November, 60,000 liters of crude oil spilled into muskeg from a failed pipeline, in Red Earth Creek in northern Alberta. 2015: On May 5, a gas transmission pipeline failed approximately 36 kilometers southeast of Drumheller, Alberta. 2015: On July 15, a pipeline at a Long Lake oil sands facility in northern Alberta leaked about 31,500 barrels of oil emulsion. 2018: On January 7, a butane oil pipeline ruptured in St. John, New Brunswick. 2013: a Sinopec Corp oil pipeline exploded in Huangdao, Qingdao, Shandong Province, on November 22, 2013. 2017: On June 17, a farm near city of Jamnagar was flooded with oil. 1978 On November 1, a gas pipeline exploded and burned, killing 52 people in colonia Benito Juarez, Mexico, and injuring 11 in a town of only 100 people. 2012 On September 18, 2012, twenty-two workers died when a gas leak from a Kinder Morgan pipeline at Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico sparked an explosion which became a fireball that overtook workers running for their lives, lead plaintiff Javier Alvarez del Castillo said. He blamed Kinder Morgan for not adding enough of the odorant methyl mercaptan to the gas. (May 12, 2006) 2006: A vandalised oil pipeline exploded in Lagos. Workers with the pipeline noticed pressure dropping in the line, but they increased pressure instead of searching for a leak. Trees up to 4 kilometers away were felled by the blast, and 2 locomotives and 38 passenger cars on the trains were derailed. The flames raged for hours, devastating several houses. The oil then caught fire. Leaking gas, suspected to be propylene, filled the storm drains along several major thoroughfares and the resulting explosions turned several kilometers of road surface into deep trenches, sending vehicles, people and debris high into the air and igniting fires over a large area. Explosion details 2018 (September 13) Suspected overpressurization of natural gas pipes by Columbia Gas caused multiple explosions and fires in 3 towns in Massachusetts (Andover, Lawrence, and North Andover). At least 9 others were injured, and 7 homes 450 feet from the rupture were destroyed. 1999 (June 10) An Olympic gasoline pipeline ruptured near Bellingham, Washington, resulting in 3 deaths: a fly fisherman and two 10-year-old boys. The cause was a series of errors and malfunctions in relief systems and process control computer systems in the Olympic Pipeline system, resulting in 277,000 gallons of gasoline spilled to Whatcom Creek. 2000 (19 August) A 30-inch El Paso Energy natural gas pipeline exploded, killing twelve people in southeast New Mexico. They were camping under a bridge which carried the pipeline across the Pecos River. The explosion occurred underground on the east side of the river 200 to 300 yards from the campers around 5:30 a.m.. The explosion left a crater 86 feet long, 46 feet wide and 20 feet deep. The fireball was visible 20 miles north in Carlsbad, N.M. The blaze sent three firefighters to the hospital, and a mile-square area, which included a nearby fire station, was cordoned off. The leak occurred in a half-inch-wide tube of stainless steel that Olympic operators use to extract fuel samples from the system's 16-inch-wide main line. When it blew, nobody at pipeline operator, Columbia Gas Transmission knew it. 2013 (29 March) ExxonMobil pipeline carrying Canadian Wabasca heavy crude from the Athabasca oil sands ruptured in Mayflower, Arkansas, about 25 miles northwest of Little Rock. Approximately 12,000 barrels (1,900 m3) of oil mixed with water had been recovered by March 31. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classified the leak as a major spill. 2014 (Jan 25) A Trans Canada pipeline about 15 miles south of Winnipeg ruptured and exploded. The incident prompted the precautionary closure of two nearby pipelines. The explosion happened near Otterburne, Manitoba, about 15 miles south of the provincial capital, Winnipeg. The area was evacuated as a precaution. 2014 (Feb) In Knifely, Adair County, Kentucky, a Columbia Gulf gas pipeline exploded at 1 a.m. flattening homes, burning barns, and causing one casualty. The 30-inch natural gas pipeline was about 100 feet from Highway 76 and buried 30 feet underground. When it exploded, large rocks and sections of pipeline flew into the air, leaving a 60-foot crater. 2014 (Feb 11) A Hiland gas pipeline exploded about six miles south of Tioga, North Dakota. 2014 (Mar 14) A Northern Natural Gas Company pipeline erupted near the intersection of county roads 20 and O, about six miles north of Fremont, Nebraska. Roads within a two-mile radius were blocked off. Archived from the original (PDF) on 2011-07-24. Retrieved 2010-12-31. 15 February 2013. Archived from the original on 15 February 2013. google.com.

North Dakota Department of Health, provided Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save BELFIELD -- A federal agency has ordered Belle Fourche Pipeline to improve leak detection, remediate any pipeline in unstable land areas and take other steps to protect the environment following an oil spill that contaminated a Little Missouri River tributary. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration issued a corrective action order to Belle Fourche, part of True Cos. of Wyoming, stemming from its investigation into the spill discovered Dec. 5 by a landowner northwest of Belfield. The agency identified a 58-mile segment of the oil pipeline that traverses similar topography and ordered the company to conduct a risk assessment. The company also must evaluate other segments that were installed using the same method. More than 1,900 barrels, or 79,800 gallons, of oil has been recovered with cleanup efforts still ongoing, said Wendy Owen, spokeswoman for True Cos. Crews are skimming oil off the creek and doing some controlled burns, said Bill Suess, spill investigation program manager for the North Dakota Department of Health. The spill was not detected by monitoring equipment on the pipeline. The corrective order requires Belle Fourche to install leak detection equipment within six months, with a high priority placed on areas associated with the Little Missouri River and other water crossings more than 100 feet wide. A 19-mile segment of the pipeline has been isolated and shut down. The corrective action order requires Belle Fourche to take several additional steps prior to restarting the pipeline: Conduct daily aerial patrols of the affected segment of pipeline for the next 14 days, including the use of an infrared camera to locate any areas of potential oil leaks. Complete testing and analysis of the failed section of pipe within 90 days and submit a root cause failure analysis within 120 days. Conduct an in-line inspection of the pipeline with a tool capable to detecting stress caused by ground movement. She noted that some of the measures in the order were already being addressed by the company. A PHMSA inspector is expected to be on-site for the excavation. The Laborers District Council of Minnesota and North Dakota has urged regulators to provide strong oversight of True Cos., citing a track record of spills and environmental incidents. The North Dakota Oil and Gas Division, the North Dakota Department of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency also are investigating the incident. This can be removed when origin is fixed.

Not you. Not carbon dioxide. Indeed, over the past seven years, more than 20,000 miles of oil pipelines have been approved and built in the United States, almost none of them requiring more than 18 months of review. Instead, the decision in this case became hopelessly politicized because the United States environmental lobby decided to make it a symbol of their ideological opposition to greenhouse gas emissions. They think they have won the game. I have news for them. They have been watching the wrong ball. Canadian crude oil exports to the United States have been growing steadily since 1990. In 1994, the exports were about 40 million barrels per year and they grew to 110 million barrels per year in 2015. Well, it was primarily because U.S. refiners wanted it and were prepared to pay for it. There are 70 pipelines across the Canada-U.S. border. Keystone XL would be better and cheaper, but its denial will only raise costs, it will not block movement. The fact is that the Gulf refineries were built to process exactly the kind of heavy crude oil that is available from Canada. Most of the growth in U.S. production is light crude oil. So, the Canadian crude is displacing heavy oil from Venezuela. The U.S. State Department Environmental Impact Statement devoted pages and pages to analyzing this subject and waffled in its observations. This can be demonstrated in percentage terms. If you multiply those figures (i.e. In other words, it is one five thousandth of annual global emissions. That is much less than the rounding errors used for statistical analysis. So, in the worst case, the emissions that would be avoided by rejecting the Keystone XL project can hardly be measured. They are delighted that the international price of crude oil has declined sharply over the past year, because that will offer less incentive for investment in new oil supplies, especially in higher cost sources like oil sands. They believe that their efforts will be successful in reducing oil and gas development and infrastructure construction. Lower oil prices just mean increased demand for the fuel. With lower oil prices, the demand increases may be even faster. Crude oil pipelines under construction now that will be completed in future years total 3,885 miles in the United States and 2,968 miles in Canada out of a global total of 10,626 miles.

Nov. 14 2016 1:56 PM The Kids Suing the Government Over Climate Change Are Our Best Hope Now Luckily, they just cleared a major bar. By Eric Holthaus Xiuhtezcatl Martinez, pictured in the foothills of north Boulder, Colorado, on Aug. 11, is one of the young plaintiffs in the climate case. The path was cleared by a federal district court judge in Oregon who wrote an opinion preliminarily finding that a stable climate is a fundamental constitutional right. In the groundbreaking decision, announced on Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Ann Aiken ruled in favor of a group of 21 children and young adults in their suit against the federal government. The case, Juliana v. United States, will now go to trial starting sometime in 2017 and could prove to be a major civil rights suit, eventually finding its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The young plaintiffs, who range in age from 9 to 20, allege that climate change violates their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property by causing direct harm and destroying so-called public trust assets such as coastlines. The case argues that climate change is worsened by the aggregated actions of the federal government in permitting fossil fuel development, subsidizing the fossil fuel industry, and many other such actions. Further, the children and their lawyers say these government actions are willfully prioritizing short-term profit, convenience, and the concerns of current generations over those of future generations. The plaintiffs state that the government and these companies have continued to prioritize these short-term gains for more than five decades with full knowledge of the extreme dangers they posed. Lead plaintiff Kelsey Juliana, who lives in Oregon, alleges that algae blooms harm the water she needs to drink and that low water levels caused by drought kill the wild salmon she needs to eat. Martinez, who lives in Colorado, alleges increased wildfires and extreme flooding jeopardize his personal safety. Other plaintiffs are from farming families, suffer from asthma, and have had their homes overrun by raw sewage during the recent floods in Louisiana. The suit claims that by failing to protect these children from human-caused climate-related harm, the government violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. It goes on to say that these harms, and others, are caused in part by climate change and are preventable if the government acts to hasten the transition to a zero-carbon economy. In her decision, drawing on the recent Supreme Court decision of Obergefell v Hodges that guaranteed the right to same-sex marriage, Judge Aiken wrote: I have no doubt that the right to a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society. Just as marriage is the foundation of the family, a stable climate system is quite literally the foundation of society, without which there would be neither civilization nor progress. According to other legal experts I consulted, she might be right. President-elect Donald Trump does not believe climate change is real, and the information we currently have about how he would address the global crisis suggests his actions would be both woefully inadequate and possibly devastating. Of course, the suit will not have an immediate effect on policy. The trial and appeals process could take years, even in the best-case scenario. Another climate law expert I spoke with, Michael Blumm at Lewis and Clark Law School, said he expected lawyers for the Trump administration to attempt to drag the process out as long as possible. The suit is currently against President Barack Obama, as well as several parts of the executive branch, like the Department of Transportation. Trump will automatically become a named defendant when he assumes the presidency on Jan. 20, Olson told CNN. Advertisement Should the case reach the Supreme Court under the Trump administration, Olson told me that she is confident her side would prevail. The case has not yet gone to trial, so the speculation on a Supreme Court ruling is premature, Blumm said. As I wrote last year, the plot of this lawsuit is like something out of a Disney movie: A group of committed kids from across the country and a charismatic lawyer are fighting for the future of the planet against Big Oil and the president of the United States. The lead attorney for the government in this case, Sean Duffy, referred a request for comment to the Department of Justice, which has yet to respond. The kids are encouraging Obama to come to the settlement table and talk about preliminary relief before Trump assumes office. This country also has among the greatest capacity for quickly marshaling resources to solve the problem. This development has likely eliminated the small remaining window for global climate action to keep warming this century to less than 2 degrees Celsius, as agreed upon in the 2015 Paris accord, which went into force on Nov. 4 of this year. Top Comment This is stupid More... Join In If the Paris accord does not last, global emissions, which have been roughly flat since 2013, could go back up. Separately, a new study out this week considered how a resumption of business-as-usual increases in emissions might affect the climate. The new research found that a worst-case scenario of warming may induce an unimaginable level of impacts by the end of the century, including a temperature rise of between 4 and more than 7 degrees Celsius, more than the currently accepted 3.5 to 4.5 degrees. It would effectively be the apocalypse. The lawsuit offers a path forward for fighting this outcome. Follow him on Twitter.

While this pipeline explosion ruptured on private property in an isolated area, if a similar incident were to occur near the Missouri River, it would decimate the water supply of the Standing Rock reservation. It seems crazy that a 13-year-old can have a better understanding of reality than the proponents of the DAPL, but perhaps that is due to the fact that they have vested financial interest in seeing oil flow, while she cares solely about the health and safety of her family, friends, and neighbors.

The 1,100-mile pipeline, the subject of controversy and mass protests, will be fully operational June 1, according to Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the company that built it. But in April, a mechanical failure caused an 84-gallon oil spill northeast of Tulare, a tiny town in South Dakota. The spill was entirely contained and is considered small. Watch the VICELAND documentary on Standing Rock: The spill happened April 4 during the testing of a surge pump, according to Brian Walsh, an environmental scientist with the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources. At this particular pump station, oil is pumped into what's called a surge tank, which measures flow rates, among other things, and then pumped back into the main line. The surge pump had a mechanical failure, but the entire spill happened within a lined containment area. Gravel on top of the liner that covered with oil was collected and disposed of, and oil never touched the unlined ground.

The South Dakota government tracks spills of all kinds on a map on a website, searchable by date, type of spill, and responsible party. But there are no announcements of any particular spill; a reporter for the Aberdeen American News, a local outlet, broke the story of the DAPL after finding it on the site. The state's full report on the spill isn't complete yet. Walsh said it will take a couple of weeks, once ETP submits documentation to show that it disposed of contaminated materials properly. Meanwhile, the tribe's legal battle against ETP continues. They has asked a judge to declare that the Trump administration's reversal of the environmental study and issuing the permits was illegal. That decision could take weeks or months. In the meantime, new reports have emerged revealing that the company doesn't yet have emergency equipment in place to handle a major spill in the future.

Most recently, the so-called Belle Fourche pipeline ruptured, resulting in some 130,000 gallons of crude oil being spilled into the environment. The leaking crude then traveled almost six miles to nearby Ash Coulee Creek, where a timely winter storm froze the creek, preventing the toxic sludge from reaching the Missouri river. Unless the spilled oil is removed from the area, it will seep into the creek, and then flow into the river. But confidence is low, as a 2013 oil spill has still not been cleaned up. Belle Fourche Pipeline spill in Billings county. Ok, maybe the Dakota protesters were right. At the time, an estimated 840,000 gallons of oil fouled 13 acres of soil, about the size of 14 football fields. A decontamination crew working on the environmental catastrophe dug as deep as 50 feet, removing and displacing enormous amounts of soil. Yet the company has not set a date for completion. The Dakota Access is enormous when compared to December's ruptured oil line in Belle Fourche, as the latter moves about 6 million gallons daily, according to North Dakota Pipeline Authority 2011 report. The Dakota Access pipeline, a much larger pipeline, is reported to be some 30 inches in diameter, compared to 7-inch pipe of both Tesoro and True Cos's Belle Fourche pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based company responsible for constructing the pipeline, has a lengthy spill record, with 29 reported pipeline ruptures, leaks, or accidents since 2006, leading to nearly 10,000 barrels (420,000 gallons) of hazardous liquids dumped into the environment. President-elect Donald Trump, a supporter and early investor of the Dakota Access pipeline, has said that he will wait until he is in office to review the Army Corps' decision to halt construction, according to Trump spokesman Jason Miller.

The spill was detected Friday at a site 10 kilometres north of Stoughton in a low-lying area with a frozen slough. Doug MacKnight, assistant deputy minister of Economy, says about 170,000 litres have been recovered so far. MacKnight says the oil is not entering any creeks or streams. MacKnight says the government was notified about the spill on Friday, but details were only made public Monday when the volume of the spill became clear. The land is part of the Ocean Man First Nation. The Economy Ministry's petroleum and natural gas division will oversee cleanup and pipeline repairs. MacKnight says the province has sent a pipeline engineer to the site, but it will take some time to determine the cause of the spill. Tundra Energy Marketing is handling the cleanup, but MacKnight says there are several pipelines in the area and could not confirm that Tundra owns the pipeline that leaked. The spill is nearly the size of a leak in a Husky Energy (TSX:HSE) pipeline last July near Maidstone, Sask. The Husky leak jeopardized the drinking water of thousands of people after about 225,000 litres of oil was spilled and about 40 per cent made it into the North Saskatchewan River. The cities of North Battleford, Prince Albert and Melfort were forced to shut their intakes from the river and find other water sources for almost two months. The company said it recovered about 210,000 litres of oil spilled before it wrapped up shoreline cleanup efforts in October. Husky's report into the spill said shifting ground was to blame for the pipeline burst.

Ten days since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers blocked construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, officials have confirmed that another pipeline has leaked an estimated 176,000 gallons of crude oil just 150 miles away in Belfield. A landowner discovered the spill from the Belle Fourche Pipeline on December 5. True Companies of Wyoming, which owns the pipeline, has cited a failure in their electronic monitoring equipment as the reason that the leak was not detected earlier. Currently 120 people are on location working to clean up the mess, with health department staff and the EPA overseeing the operation. Protection of our surface water is one of our primary concerns, in addition to the aquatic life in the creek affected by the spill. By the time the crude was contained, tens of thousands of gallons of the stuff had spilled into more than five miles of the Ash Coulee Creek running through private and federal land. The creek is a tributary of the Little Missouri River, but health department environment scientist Bill Suess told the Associated Press it appeared no oil reached the bigger river or drinking water sources. The North Dakota Industrial Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration, as well as the state health department are launching investigations. For the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the incident confirms the fears of an oil spill that contributed to their months long protest against the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe, their primary supply for drinking water. An earlier plan sent the pipeline under the Missouri River north of Bismarck, but the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rejected the route after an environmental assessment showed it was close to municipal water sources. True Companies has a particularly troubled record among pipeline operators, reporting total spillage of 320,000 gallons of petroleum products in 36 incidents since 2006, according to the AP. But data from the Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration shows there are hundreds of spills a year across the industry costing millions of dollars.

Our concerns were clearly articulated directly to them in a tribal council meeting held on Sept. 30, 2014, where DAPL and the ND Public Service Commission came to us with this route. We have released the audio recording from that meeting. Although the news is saddening, it is not at all surprising given the last 500 years of the mistreatment of our people.

Florida Reps. A Preview of the People, Process and Politics Updating Federal Dietary Guidelines By Sarah Reinhardt Months behind schedule, two federal departments have officially kicked off the process for writing the 2020-2025 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Updated and reissued every five years, these guidelines are the nation's most comprehensive and authoritative set of nutrition recommendations. supply. These nominees will be well-known in their fields, and will bring with them more than a decade each of experience as medical or nutrition researchers, academics and practitioners. part of the process is happening in real time. what happens after the public submits nominations to the DGAC happens largely behind closed doors. Nominations will be reviewed by USDA and HHS program staff, and the slate of chosen nominees will be evaluated and vetted internally. Formal recommendations for the committee will then be reviewed and approved by the USDA and HHS secretaries. And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle. Expect to see some of the usual suspects make an appearance, including the meat industry, dairy industry, and sugar-sweetened beverage associations, as well as formula companies, which will have vested interest in shaping the new recommendations for infants and toddlers.

But it probably won't be the last, especially since the number of these outbreaks across the nation seems to be multiplying each year. Splashing in or drinking contaminated water can be dangerous for pets. If you believe your pet may have been exposed, be on the lookout for symptoms such as lethargy, seizures, diarrhea or vomiting. And as climate change gets worse, the resulting warmer waters are causing more algae outbreaks, creating a toxic feedback loop. The toxins in algae outbreaks can be ingested by small fish and shellfish. Communities that struggle with regular, serious toxic algae outbreaks, like some cities in South Florida and around Lake Erie, can lose billions of dollars from lost tourism and recreation. The study examined the placentas of five women living in London after they gave birth. The women were all non-smokers, had uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered healthy babies. Macrophages, which are white blood cells that reside all over the human body, protect the immune system as they work to engulf harmful particles, such as bacteria and pollution particles. The sooty particles found in the placental macrophages appeared similar to ones found in lung macrophages exposed to air pollutants. That's the conclusion of a report released Monday by the EPA's Office of Inspector General (OIG), the agency's internal watchdog. EPA blamed the Obama administration for the lax enforcement, and it is true that the period highlighted by the study coincides with the Obama presidency.

Levels of benzine, a flammable liquid used in fuel, were 50 times above the allowable limit, while chemicals were dumped in unlined pits and cement barriers to protect groundwater were inadequate, the research found. Dominic DiGiulio worked with Stanford academic Robert Jackson on the research after the EPA decided to ditch its own study into the situation at Pavillion, which came to light after residents complained about the smell and taste of their water. Using publicly available information and freedom of information requests, DiGiulio and Jackson have published a report in Environmental Science & Technology that examines what went wrong at Pavillion. The research finds that workers were drilling at very shallow depths, as little as 700ft underground, placing the fracking operation uncomfortably close to the drinking water aquifer that supplies the wells used by Pavillion residents. The water contamination caused by the fracking was compounded by questionable practices going back to the 1960s, before fracking took place, such as the dumping of chemicals into unlined pits. The legacy of this pollution was evident several years after fracking finished in 2007, with the EPA starting its investigation in 2010 before turning it over to Wyoming. What happened there could happen elsewhere. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process where water and chemicals are injected underground in order to draw out gas or oil resources from rock formations. The practice has proved controversial in some communities and has become a point of contention between the Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Fracking is lightly regulated in the US due to its exemption from Safe Drinking Water Act restrictions.

I could have offered this person a rather simplistic reason that any pipeline potentially exposes people to the risk of leakage and environmental pollution, and that humanity already places a dangerous over-reliance on environmentally damaging fossil fuels that imperil us all. The situation and choice of location to place the proposed pipeline beneath the Missouri River are much more complex and much more intersectional. Originally, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers planned to cross the pipeline under the Missouri River north of Bismarck, North Dakota, but decided to reposition the route due to potential threats to the drinking water in the majority-white municipality of Bismarck. They have justified threatening to evict protestors from their lands, and to incarcerate and prosecute them. The placement of the proposed pipeline stands as yet another incident in the long and brutal track record of the dominant group inflicting physical and cultural genocide on the abject bodies who get in the way or challenge a patriarchal hegemonic imperative."}, {"URL": "https://news.vice.com/story/nuns-are-standing-in-the-way-of-a-massive-pennsylvania-pipeline", "Timestamp": "20180919001300", "Sentences": "U.S. District Judge Jeffrey L.

Read more At the edge of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, near the Susquehanna River, stands a trellis in a clearing in a cornfield. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey L. Schmehl is currently hearing arguments regarding the use of eminent domain to build the 37-mile Atlantic Sunrise Pipeline, which will connect natural gas production in northeast Pennsylvania to the existing Transco natural gas pipeline near the Pennsylvania-Maryland border. Williams Corporation, the Tulsa-based energy company building the pipeline, spent nearly three years lobbying residents and business owners along the proposed path to lease or sell their land to the company so it could build and maintain the pipeline. Several Amish and Mennonite families would be impacted by the proposed pipeline, which would run under their property. Even though many of the families have either sold or agreed to lease portions of their land to Williams, there is growing concern over the logistics of maintaining the farmland during and after construction. For its part, Williams says it has tried to accommodate local residents unhappy with construction plans. But the Adorers of the Blood of Christ has refused to so much as meet with Williams, according to Stockton. Even if Schmehl rules in favor of Williams this week, the dispute will be far from over. Clatterbuck says that more than 1,000 people have pledged to engage in nonviolent direct action should eminent domain be granted. Lancaster Against Pipelines has been hosting weekly training sessions in coordination with Greenpeace over the last few months to prepare local residents. The training was inspired in part by his own experience in North Dakota last summer. Clatterbuck, a professor of Native American religion at Montclair State University, participated in the nonviolent protests against construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline there with one of his children and says that the protests gave him insight into organizing the effort in his own town. Even the nuns are preparing for immediate seizure of their property if eminent domain is granted.

Again because of lawsuits, that rule has been watered down, but Trump has successfully banned refugees from ten majority-Muslim countries plus North Korea, leading to a 40 percent drop in overall refugee admissions and a 94 percent drop in Muslim refugees. It has also stopped accepting new applications for the program, which has been around since 2014, and plans to abolish it altogether. The idea is to coordinate help for more than 60 million people who have been driven from their homes by wars, poverty, or climate change. But the U.S. announced in December that it was quitting; Secretary of State Rex Tillerson claimed that participating would undermine American sovereignty. Immigration agents are now required to treat the claims of asylum-seekers more skeptically Homeland Security is telling its asylum officers to take a more critical stance on the stories of immigrants who say they are fleeing violence or persecution. If the interviewees seem nervous, the agents are to avoid factoring in that it might be caused by trauma or culture shock. Immigration lawyers told CNN it could mean millions fewer immigrants will be admitted here by 2020. Criminal Justice Federal prosecutors have been stripped of their discretion and ordered to seek maximum penalties Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued the order in May, with a specific intent that prosecutors pursue stiff sentences for drug-dealing, gun crimes, and gang violence. But the mandate applies to every kind of case. A police-department reform program has been cut off After the Department of Justice sued the police in Ferguson, Missouri, and ordered the department to clean up its act on race relations, the DOJ created a program where other police departments could seek similar guidance, but on a voluntary, cooperative basis. Police departments in Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Las Vegas, among others, took advantage of it. Sessions effectively cut off the program and channeled the money to groups like police unions instead. Local police are once again stocking up on military weapons After police in Ferguson used military weapons against protesters in 2015, Obama took measures to end the militarization of police. Sessions rescinded those rules, so police can once again obtain surplus grenade-launchers, bayonets, and armored vehicles for free or with federal dollars. In August, though, the Department of Education said it would stop sharing student information that the watchdogs depend on. Schools have more leeway on how they investigate sexual-assault reports Under Obama, schools were told to come down against the accused students if there was more evidence of guilt than of innocence. A plan to reduce racial disparities in schools is being delayed Under a plan released in the waning days of the Obama administration, the states would have to review districts where minority students are disciplined or sent into special education disproportionately often. It was set to take effect next year; DeVos has pushed it back to 2020 and may end up scrapping it altogether. Environment The U.S. has rescinded its commitment to the Paris climate accord The U.S. submitted its formal notice of withdrawal from the Paris climate accord in August. Besides the implications for domestic energy policy, this means the U.S. will renege on promises to provide aid to poorer countries for climate measures, and may also cause diplomatic and economic blowback around the world. The EPA is dismantling its Clean Power Plan The Clean Power Plan was intended to make sure the U.S. met its overarching goal in the Paris deal: i.e., to reduce carbon emissions by at least 26 percent by 2025. It would limit carbon pollution from energy plants and would encourage states to invest in alternative energy. Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, has said he wants to replace the plan with new guidelines, but meanwhile the repeal is underway. The Dakota Access pipeline is now open, after its final construction phase was greenlighted by the Army The pipeline runs more than 1,100 miles from North Dakota to southern Illinois. The pipeline opened in June. And the State Department has approved construction of the Keystone XL pipeline The Keystone pipeline is designed to ship oil from Alberta, Canada, down to Texas, via the Canadian firm TransCanada. Trump invited the company to reapply, and in March the State Department approved its plans. Environmentalists worry it will devastate marine life and lead to oil spills. After some setbacks in court, the Bureau of Land Management has worked out a plan to delay the implementation until 2019. The EPA has canceled limits on the pollutants power plants can dump into waterways Steam electric plants unload aluminum, arsenic, mercury, and other pollutants into streams, which has been linked to fish die-offs and other environmental problems. But under Trump, the agency has retracted those limits and said it will come up with new guidelines instead. Plastic water bottles are once again allowed in national parks In 2011, the National Park Service banned plastic bottles, a rule intended to keep the parks clean. Hunters are free to use lead ammunition in national parks The Obama administration banned lead ammunition at the end of 2016, along with lead sinkers for fishing, on the grounds that lead is widely known to be toxic. The Department of Interior, led by outdoorsman and former oil-company-board-member Ryan Zinke, lifted the rule in March. Environmentalists were especially upset about the Pacific walrus, given that its habitat in the Arctic is eroding due to global warming. As the CEO of Exxon, Rex Tillerson had lobbied vigorously against it, and the first bill Trump signed after taking office annulled the rule. It was supposed to take effect on June 1, but the Department of Labor has refused to enforce it, and the administration is trying to repeal it entirely. Investment banks were reportedly irked about the competition. Worker Protections The Labor Department is backing off on overtime enforcement Obama tried to cut off the exemptions that companies use to avoid paying overtime to millions of workers. Under Sessions, however, the DOJ has changed its position: It now says employers are free to discriminate against transgender people, and it plans to argue that position in any future court cases. Industry lobbyists called it a job-killer, and Trump revoked it in March. Consumer Protections The subsidies that undergirded Obamacare have been wiped out The federal funds went to insurance companies so they could offer cheap plans to poor people. Employers can now refuse to cover birth control In contrast to the original Obamacare rules, any employer can now opt out of paying for contraceptives for employees by claiming they have moral or religious objections. Hundreds of thousands of women may lose their access to contraceptives. The government is also paying some of the legal fees for groups that sued the Obama administration to get this mandate overturned. The Obama administration spent five years working on a vast rule that would have encouraged more class-action suits, but in October, Congress voted to strike it down, and Trump swiftly signed the bill. The FCC voted in December to revoke those rules. It also voted to reduce its own influence over broadband companies, which will constrain future regulatory efforts. But in August, the FCC found an obscure loophole that will let Sinclair buy 42 more stations and expand its reach to as much as 72 percent of the country. The FCC is targeting rules meant to protect local journalism The FCC has taken other measures to help Sinclair as well. The rule helped protect the connection between local communities and their news organizations. And in November, the agency removed limits on how many stations or newspapers any company can own in a single local market. In November, its board voted to impose a cap on the subsidies, and it also approved a measure that will force most poor households to find a new internet provider. The EPA has decided not to ban a ubiquitous pesticide from farms Chlorpyrifos, which farmers use to kill pests on fruits and vegetables, has been known to cause headaches and nausea at high doses and to harm fetal development. Foreign Policy The military and CIA have eliminated measures that protected civilians from drone strikes In the fall, Trump approved two changes to the use of military drones, according to the New York Times. One change allowed the military and CIA to target low-level jihadists with no particular skills or leadership roles. The other removed the requirement for high-level vetting before an attack is carried out. A similar ban is in place for businesses. Miscellaneous FEMA has dropped construction standards meant to help with flood preparation The agency issued construction standards in 2015 for roads, housing, and other infrastructure built with federal money, in response to climate change. One provision, for instance, would have required buildings to be elevated from the reach of rising water. Trump struck the rules down less than two weeks before Hurricane Harvey hit. A rule aimed at combating housing segregation has been suspended The Small Area Market Rent Rule, which was scheduled to take effect next year, would give bigger subsidies to some Section 8 recipients so they can afford to move out of impoverished areas. That provision was delayed, then thrown out in October. Many federal agencies are being less generous with public information. EPA scientists have been restricted from speaking in public about climate change. The White House no longer keeps logs of its visitors, which would reveal who has had direct access to the president. The same is true at Mar-a-Lago. And the administration has refused to release the names of some members serving on its deregulation teams. A rule from the Obama administration blocked their efforts for a few months early this year, but Congress quickly voted to undo it, and Trump signed the bill in April. International nonprofits that provide abortions can be defunded, too The Mexico City Policy, announced by Reagan in 1984, revoked federal funding for any nongovernmental organization, anywhere in the world, that provides abortion counseling. It has been repealed and reinstated several times since, depending on which party is in power, and Trump reinstated it in January.

I've worked in places with a drug culture, aint too pretty, useless workers, lazy & forgetful. It would be great to see some more use of some natural fibers. In rope at least there's some places different plants grow higher & you get longer more useful fiber from them, more important in rope making. Jeff.

Once the doctor gave me pills for an injury I had, and it made me live in a bad LSD trip for about 10 days. Not nice. In that respect I would have prefered something more natural. Anyhow, back to the topic: In many cases glass or other manmades are not neccesary. For instance in serving trays, interiors, etc. Natural fibers also make a composite product more easy to recycle (at least you can burn it in energy plants, without nasty residues from glass or carbon leaving behind) In car interiors natural fibers (non wovens)already made their way, for a huge TECHNICAL advantage: the sound dampening is huge, compared to alternatives. And that is where it is all about: cost and performance. As long as these are not up to par with what is used today, the market will be very small. Does anyone know of any studies or documents which compare the strength of bio-fibres to carbon-fibres. I've heard that hemp can have a higher tensile strength but has poor impact resistance. Talking to a top Naval architect in NZ last year he didn't think at the time bio-fibres were at a point where they could compete with glass fibres. If it costs more than canvas, I would not buy it. I just recently built a boat from recycled corrugated cardboard, with a cotton fabric covering bonded with Tight-bond glue.

This map only show the spills that have been reported since 2005 WIRED Hurricane Ivan would not die. After traveling across the Atlantic Ocean, it stewed for more than a week in the Caribbean, fluctuating between a Category 3 and 5 storm while battering Jamaica, Cuba, and other vulnerable islands. And as it approached the US Gulf Coast, it stirred up a massive mud slide on the sea floor. The mudslide created leaks in 25 undersea oil wells, snarled the pipelines leading from the wells to a nearby oil platform, and brought the platform down on top of all of it. Also, twelve years later, the mess is still leaking. Since the storm, its oil slick stretches over eight square miles on an average day. Every year thousands of oil and chemical spills occur in waters around the country, but unless you live in a highly impacted area like Louisiana, you probably only hear about a handful of them. It makes sense that not every greasy pelican is national news. But as a group, they probably should be. Oil is toxic. Oil spills, however small, have a cumulative environmental impact. But the regulations in place to prevent them are limited, and in some cases, absurd. For instance, the US Coast Guard basically relies on oil companies to use the honor system when reporting leaks. And since oil leaks happen not only because oil technology is often either too old or too new, but also because of human error, that's what we call a real conflict of interest. Size Doesn't Matter Oil leaks have been around longer than humans have been drilling. In Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of California, petroleum naturally seeps up through the seafloor. But natural oil seeps are slow, and old. But the majority of ocean life never developed the appetite for oil. Or much defense against it. Air breathing animals like dolphins and turtles suck in oil if they surface in a slick, and when even small amounts of oil end up in their lungs, they suffer fatal pneumonia-esque health issues. Plants and algae can't photosynthesize under a grungy film. And even a few molecules of oil can kill fish larvae. Human physiology isn't a fan either. MacDonald and his students have turned the collapsed Taylor Energy site into something of a lab, because it reliably leaks between 84 and 1,470 gallons per day. Except, Size Definitely Matters Each red dot above represents an oil spill reported to the National Response Center between 2005 and today. They're concentrated in the Gulf, but you can zoom out to see spills in other areas, are click on a spill to see when someone reported it. Even a few thousand gallons of spilled oil is consequential. Even more consequential are more than 30,000 of those so-called small spills each year. Which is probably the bare minimum spill estimate, says Manthos of SkyTruth. Really, it's hard to know if this figure is complete, and even harder to calculate the volume of oil being leaked. Some new oil equipment is smart enough to know when, and measure how much, it leaks. But those sensors can malfunction. Plus most oil infrastructure is way older. Most of the time oil companies, activists, and the US Coast Guard are all doing some version of educated guessing. Their biggest clues comes from the size and color of an oil slick. Neither of which are great. Color gives a clues about an oil spill's thickness. The volumes that oil companies and others do calculate and report get compiled in a National Response Center database. And if you ask an oil lobbyist, it all totals to about one million gallons per year. And those oil company-provided numbers are what the US Coast Guard relies on to levy fines against those that spill. Which is a problem, because oil companies have a financial incentive to lowball the spill estimates, because the fines levied against them often triple if they cross that major spill threshold. At SkyTruth, Manthos uses satellite imagery and remote sensing data to get a much more definitive picture of spill size and color than you can get from sticking your head out of a helicopter door. And does not account for the many spills that go unnoticed somewhere along the 2.4 million miles of oil pipe in the United States. Not for lack of trying. And oil companies don't need to be accurate. The Coast Guard's self-defense on these enforcement matters isn't too convincing. She would not comment more specifically. Aging Infrastructure and Poor Regulation American oil infrastructure is old. On this map, each dot represents a still-standing platform or rig. The lighter the dot, the older the construction. The oldest date back to the 1960s. You can click on a rig to see the installation date. But the government does not require the industry to do sweeping upgrades of its aging, leaky equipment. The infrastructure issues are a mixture of growing pains and poor maintenance. There's new stuff, like Deep Water Horizons: under-tested, in deep water, under high pressure, and far from land. But that new stuff is, as you can now guess, rare. Many more leaks come from rust bucket rigs that are chronically broken and patched, instead of rebuilt, says Eustis. These rigs are usually close to shore, have changed hands a few times, and are now operated by the subcontractor of a subcontractor of a subcontractor of a subsidiary of a major oil company. And the older they are, the more they leak. Many aren't even operational anymore. According to Henderson, about 36,000 abandoned wells dot the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico, sites where the oil companies either drilled and didn't find anything below the sediment, or sapped a reserve to the point where it made more sense to move resources on to other, juicier wells. But that doesn't mean that these wells are exhausted: in many cases small (or not so small) amounts of oil are still hanging out in the reservoir or the pipes connected to it. Or sitting in the path of some future hurricane. An issue of this magnitude clearly isn't down to a few shady companies. All they look at now is financial ability. So whether you're a reputable and responsible oil company, a petrol-curious dude who came into some cash, or the most notorious oil spiller in the galaxy, your chances of expanding your oil empire are equal. Having few incentives other than financial ones breeds a poor safety culture. She attributes the situation in part to the cowboy mythos of American oil exploration. As far as they're concerned, they don't need help outside their own bootstraps, so they sure as heck don't need the National Academy of Sciences or government regulation to tell them how to do their jobs. But to be fair, a sizable portion of the blame for that problem falls at the feet of their managers pushing for more and more oil flowing at faster and faster rates. And those managers are responding to the demands of, well, capitalism's appetite for oil. Leaky Past, Leakier Future Ah, capitalism. Despite environmental concerns, the world, and especially the United States, is still slurping up a lot of oil. And President-elect Trump's position on offshore oil drilling and preserving the jobs of oil workers makes that unlikely to change in the next four years. But Weaver doesn't necessarily see a future where every tract of land off US coasts is suddenly fair game. Like the Taylor Energy site, with barely a decade of leaks behind it, and many more to come.

The researchers assessed the carcinogenicity of 1,177 water pollutants and 143 air pollutants released by the fracking process and from fracking wastewater. Of the 119 compounds with sufficient data, 44 percent of the water pollutants and 60 percent of air pollutants were either confirmed or possible carcinogens. Fracking is now a fact of life in 30 states across the U.S., posing major risks to public health due to air and water contamination. In 2013, The Wall Street Journal analyzed well location and census data for more than 700 counties in 11 major energy-producing states and found that at least 15.3 million Americans lived within a mile of a well that has been drilled since 2000, more people than live in Michigan or New York City. Children are especially vulnerable to air pollution and water contamination caused by fracking. Often, these facilities are located close to more than one well and are also near compressor stations, pipelines and other fossil fuel infrastructure with impacts on public health. More than 650,000 kindergarten through twelfth grade children attend school within one mile of a fracked well. The highest percentage of children attending school close to fracked wells is in West Virginia, where 8 percent of children spend their school days within one mile of a fracked well.

Two girls recorded the encounter on their phones as a crowd looked on. Among them were indigenous, Appalachian, and immigrant activists, each performing the attacks and defense of their communities and environment. Their scene represented the most potent symbol of contemporary American racism: a young black man being brutalized by a cop. Peoples Climate March demonstrators march down Pennsylvania Avenue, April 29, 2017. The only major coal plant currently being constructed in the country today, it would be the first large-scale plant to use the energy-intensive Carbon Capture and Storage technology (which gasifies the coal, captures the carbon emissions, and stores them in the ground). This kind of data has largely been eclipsed by the numbers trumpeted by the climate movement: limiting atmospheric carbon emissions to 350 parts per million, and capping global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. As extreme weather grows more frequent, vulnerable communities will become yet more vulnerable. The Carver Terrace hosing project sits next to an oil refinery in west Port Arthur, Texas. Yet, for Katherine Egland, climate change and environmental pollution are civil-rights issues, just like criminal justice or education. Yet race has remained a consistent blind spot in the environmental movement. This has begun to change as public attention alights on Native communities along the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines. But without directly addressing how environmental injustice impacts poor communities of color disproportionately, racial and economic inequality is likely to deepen as climate change grows more disruptive. At least 68 percent of African Americans live within 30 miles of a coal-fired plant, compared with only 56 percent of the white population. But subtler environmental changes are also wreaking havoc around the country. Elsewhere in the United States, coastal retreat poses an existential threat to communities with identities connected to the land. Already, a matrix of pipelines and canals carved into the wetlands by the oil industry are exacerbating erosion, but Energy Transfer Partners is still planning to build the final leg of its Dakota Access pipeline, the Bayou Bridge, across 11 parishes, including the freed-slave community of St. James. Still, their culture is under threat even if they remain: Some claim that the oil canals are cutting off oxygen to the crawfish in the Atchafalaya Basin. asked Foytlin. The basin is the only place in the state where crawfish are still caught in the wild. Edgar Franks, an organizer with Community to Community, a Bellingham grassroots organization for food sovereignty and immigrant rights, recalls them talking about getting nosebleeds and passing out from the 115 degree heat. Cooler climates awaited them in Washington, but the large industrial farms remain, as do the threats of ICE raids on the workers keeping the agricultural industry afloat. These corporate factory farms are big contributors to climate change, from the petroleum-based chemical fertilizers to the fuel and refrigeration required to transport the produce across long distances. Tribes are shoring up their sovereignty in similar ways, said Tom Goldtooth, executive director of the Indigenous Environmental Network. Reverting to traditional ways of agriculture might entail a return to seeds that preexisted the arrival of white settlers (not to mention genetic modification). These would have naturally evolved to thrive in local ecosystems, and would lead to greater biodiversity than our current food system allows. The Indian Wars, which accompanied the largest land-grab in US history, were intended to secure farmland and natural resources for white settlers, and were carried out through the mass displacement, genocide, and confinement to reservations of Native people . Many at the Standing Rock encampment saw their treatment by Energy Transfer Partners and local police (who deployed dogs, tanks, flash grenades, and sound cannons against the water protectors) as just its latest iteration. But this is not the only component of the Sioux resistance against the fossil-fuel government. A row of law-enforcement officers faces Dakota Access pipeline protesters along North Dakota Highway 6, south of St. Anthony, North Dakota, on October 10, 2016. This came about after a series of failed attempts by outside developers to harness the muscular prairie winds for a share of the profits. The result was the first tribal public power authority in the United States, an independent, nonprofit entity to construct and operate renewable energy resources at a local scale, and for the benefit of the community. Owned and controlled by the tribes (Spotted Eagle is on the advisory council of elders), the agency is designed to distribute surplus revenues back to the tribes for use in local development. And it also provides affordable clean energy to tribal ratepayers, helping to weaken the stranglehold of the fossil-fuel industry, and shoring up their self-reliance and sovereignty. Community-owned renewables are not only a rural or tribal phenomenon. They exist in cities throughout the United States (including Los Angeles; Seattle; and Chattanooga, Tennessee), with residential customers of public power utilities paying average electricity rates that are 14 percent lower than for investor-owned utilities. In the Brooklyn neighborhood of Sunset Park, home to a sizable Latino and Chinese immigrant population, the community group UPROSE is working on three solar projects that will be community-owned and -governed, and will lower electricity costs for local subscribers (low-income households will be prioritized). But these solar projects are only one part of their larger vision for neighborhood development. As in other gentrifying neighborhoods, skyrocketing housing costs are already pushing many low-income residents out of Sunset Park. But reserving that waterfront space for green manufacturers (and possibly offshore wind turbines) would not only slow this process but also provide local green jobs. There was also groundwater contamination, an abundance of freeways bordering the Murder Dubs, and a lack of fresh food. Once the funds began rolling in, the communities chose how their allotments would be spent: trees to break up the concrete jungle, affordable housing to combat gentrification, bus passes for seniors, and free solar panels. This in turn created local jobs in solar installation, energy efficiency, and public transportation. Critics argue that cap-and-trade, like fining small-scale drug dealers to curb organized crime, fails to address the root of the climate crisis: the limitless economic growth and endless consumption that lie at the heart of capitalism. (These critics include Pope Francis). Others believe that, short of ending capitalism tomorrow, a just transition to renewables will require redistributing wealth from polluters to the most polluted communities (through policies like SB 535 and New York Renews). Either way, the grassroots campaigns agree that the fossil-fuel era must end.

This Dec. 10, 2016 photo provided by the North Dakota Department of Health shows an oil spill from the Belle Fourche Pipeline that was discovered Dec. 5 in Ash Coulee Creek, a tributary of the Little Missouri River, near Belfield, N.D. The discovery of the pipeline spill in western North Dakota has drawn heightened attention because of the battle over the Dakota Access oil pipeline being built across the state. While the spill was on a different pipeline, the Standing Rock Sioux and its supporters say a spill on the Dakota Access pipeline could threaten the tribe's drinking water, which is drawn from the Missouri River. About 176,000 gallons of oil spilled, with about 130,000 gallons that flowed into Ash Coulee Creek. A photo released by the North Dakota Department of Health shows the brown muck on the creek's surface, and another photo shows what appears to be the pipeline break with oil oozing out. As of Wednesday, about 46,000 gallons had been recovered. Regulators don't expect the cleanup to be completed until spring. It appears no oil got into the Little Missouri River, and no drinking water sources were threatened, according to Bill Suess, an environmental scientist with the health department. The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over. The spill was in a remote area of the southwest part of the state, far from any major population centers. It fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. A landowner spotted the spill Dec. 5. Electronic monitoring equipment failed to detect the rupture, but it's not clear why, according to Wendy Owen, a spokeswoman for Casper, Wyoming-based True Cos., which operates the pipeline. The pipeline was shut down as soon as the leak was discovered. Owen said erosion of a hillside might have ruptured the pipe, but the cause is still being investigated. It's sizeable, but there have been much larger oil spills in North Dakota. In September 2013, a Tesoro Corp. pipeline break spilled more than 840,000 gallons of oil into a wheat field near Tioga. That spill is still being cleaned up. True Cos. has a history of spills in North Dakota and Montana, including a January 2015 pipeline break into the Yellowstone River. That 32,000-gallon spill temporarily shut down water supplies in the downstream community of Glendive, Montana, after oil was detected in the city's water treatment system. It's much smaller. The 6-inch steel Belle Fourche Pipeline, built in the 1980s, is mostly underground but crosses Ash Coulee Creek above ground. It's one of a network of thousands of miles of similar pipelines that crisscross western North Dakota's oil patch to pick up oil from wells and carry it to collection points, where it ultimately moves into larger pipelines or railroad tankers destined for refineries across the U.S. The Dakota Access pipeline is a 30-inch steel pipeline that will carry nearly 20 million gallons of North Dakota oil daily through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. It is largely complete except for a segment, blocked by the federal government, that's near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, where it would be buried 90 to 115 feet below Lake Oahe. Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners says the line will have modern leak detection equipment, and that workers monitoring the pipeline remotely could close valves within three minutes if a breach was detected. The Standing Rock tribe argues that putting the pipeline under the lake imperils drinking water for more than 8,000 tribal members and millions downstream.

June 1 2017 4:37 PM Dakota Access Pipeline Will Start Operating Without a Proper Oil Spill Response Plan The pipeline is allowed to start pumping oil Thursday. By Phil McKenna Construction workers work on a section of pipeline on July 25, 2013, outside Watford City, North Dakota. Oil began flowing through the controversial Dakota Access pipeline starting Thursday, but there is still no oil spill response plan in place for the section of pipe that crosses the Missouri River just upstream from the Standing Rock reservation. Advertisement The lack of rigorous safety measures for the crude oil pipeline is raising concerns from lawyers and pipeline consultants for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, whose protests and legal fight against the Dakota Access pipeline became a flashpoint for environmental justice and indigenous rights last year. Despite the prolonged resistance, the pipeline began operating Thursday, after President Donald Trump issued an order expediting its approval. Dakota Access LLC, the company building the pipeline, is required by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to submit a general emergency plan for the entire half-million-barrel-a-day project before oil shipments begin. But no deadline has been set for it to submit a more detailed plan for the controversial Missouri River crossing as required by the Army Corps of Engineers. Without a complete emergency response plan and no requirement to have response equipment in place for another year, a spill in the months ahead could cause tremendous environmental damage, pipeline safety experts say. asked Richard Kuprewicz, president of Accufacts Inc., a consulting firm that provides pipeline expertise for industry and other parties. The pipeline company filed a motion in federal court to keep the documents sealed, claiming they contained security-sensitive information. The pipeline crosses Lake Oahe half a mile upstream of the reservation. The plans were released as part of an ongoing lawsuit by the tribe against the company and the Army Corps seeking a more thorough environmental analysis of the pipeline. In addition to the lack of plans and equipment, Kuprewicz and other pipeline safety specialists said they are concerned that the company has underestimated the time it would take to respond to a spill and that it therefore has underestimated the volume of a worst-case scenario. Dakota Access has said its pipeline will be equipped with state-of-the-art leak detection sensors that would easily identify spills. It claims it could spot a leak within nine minutes and could shut down the leaking section of pipe within 12.9 minutes. Federal data has shown that leak detection systems do not provide as much protection as the public is led to believe. The company has underestimated the time it would take to respond to a spill, and it therefore has underestimated the volume of a worst-case scenario. Advertisement As the company begins shipping oil, other parts of the pipeline have already leaked. An above-ground station and a feeder line leaked more than 100 gallons of oil in North Dakota in March. The pipeline also leaked 84 gallons of oil at a pump station in South Dakota on April 4. Lisa Dillinger, a spokeswoman for Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Dakota Access LLC, declined to respond to the specific concerns raised by Kuprewicz and others. While Dakota Access is not required to have its own emergency response equipment in place near the Missouri River until one year after operations begin, the company has listed contractors that it would work with to provide emergency response equipment and personnel in the event of a spill. So far, Dakota Access has produced two drafts of a detailed emergency response plan for the Lake Oahe crossing. A revised draft from March 2016 said the oil would be diverted to the opposite shore. Dakota Access would not say if it intends to produce a final plan. PHMSA officials would not say if it has been filed. The Army Corps did not set a deadline for the company to file the final version of the more detailed response plans for the Missouri River crossing as part of its granting of an easement. The U.S. Coast Guard, which regulates oil tankers and oil tanker loading facilities, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates oil refineries, require more detailed, site-specific emergency response plans than those required by PHMSA, said Paul Blackburn, a pipeline safety expert and attorney with Honor the Earth, a Native American environmental advocacy group. The sharpest contrast to the lax emergency response requirements for the oil pipeline perhaps are the oil spill response measures required for a small wind farm off Rhode Island that came online in December. The turbines require small amounts of lubrication grease and oil to keep the turbine blades spinning and generators producing electricity. Mineral oil is also used to insulate an electrical transformer within each turbine. The plan had to be approved before construction began by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the same agency overseeing the Dakota Access pipeline. The company also had to demonstrate that it had spill response equipment in place before the project began sending electricity to the mainland via a subsea cable. Pipeline companies routinely claim they can detect and isolate a spill within minutes, but the reality is often much different, Kuprewicz said. Approximately 1 million gallons of tar sands crude oil spilled during the leak, making it one of the worst inland spills in U.S. history. In just under 13 minutes, the pipeline would leak hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil. That worst-case figure was redacted in the spill model for Lake Oahe that was released by the court. But Blackburn estimated that a spill that took just 13 minutes to detect and shut off would leak approximately 630,000 to 903,000 gallons of oil. The 1-million-gallon Kalamazoo spill required 157,000 feet of boom, 43 boats and 79 vacuum trucks to divert and clean up the oil during the peak of cleanup operations. Top Comment Weird how everyone you quoted is either working for or aligned with the tribe on this issue. Almost like they might have an incentive to overstate risks. PHMSA has said it reviews and approves oil spill response plans in accordance with federal laws, and the agency is not involved in reviewing or approving the detailed response plan for the Lake Oahe crossing.

This story was originally published by Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. It also has claimed the lives of dozens of oil field workers. Now, that fallout from the boom is drawing renewed attention from government scientists. In the largest study of its kind, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which investigates the causes of workplace health problems, said it intends to examine the factors that cause injuries and accidents in the oil fields in an effort to improve safety. Scientists from the institute will distribute questionnaires starting next year to 500 oil field workers in North Dakota, Texas and one other state that will be determined in the coming months. As part of the new study, workers will be asked the hours they work and whether they wear protective gear as well as whether employers typically provide written safety policies and make their employees aware of their right to stop a job when they spot a potential safety hazard. Truck drivers in the industry will be asked whether they are paid by the hour or the load and whether their employers require that they drive in bad weather. The institute is collecting comments from the public on the forthcoming survey through Sept. 8. Scientists plan to ask energy companies for permission to invite workers at man camps, which house laborers; trucking centers and other facilities to participate in the survey. The results of the study, which will be finished by early 2017, will be published in peer-reviewed health and safety journals. In addition, scientists intend to share their findings with federal OSHA officials and make specific recommendations on potential improvements at safety or oil and gas industry conferences.

They face corporations emboldened by Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress, which have used their first weeks in power to grant fossil fuel industry wishes, overturning environmental protections, appointing Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, and reviving the halted Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipeline projects. The Intercept. Source: Atlantic Sunrise web site, February 17, 2017. Construction has restarted, and lawyers for the company say it could take as little as 30 days for oil to flow through the Dakota Access pipeline. And when Standing Rock tribal members saw that it was time to mobilize, they turned to relatives that had fought the Keystone XL. In 2014, Joye Braun was living at an anti-Keystone XL camp called Pte Ospaye, on the Cheyenne River reservation, when she first heard about a new pipeline that would pass just outside the border of the Standing Rock reservation, on land leaders say would be tribally controlled if the U.S. government obeyed its treaties. Two years later, she would find herself helping set up Sacred Stone camp, the first anti-Dakota Access pipeline camp. Now, most of the thousands of people that visited Standing Rock last fall have returned home, and some have taken up long-shot local fights against the oil and gas industry. In Wisconsin, the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa actually voted to decommission and remove the Enbridge Line 5 pipeline from their reservation. Many communities have turned to direct action as a last resort. The city of Lafayette, Colorado, which has long attempted to block fracking in the area, has even proposed a climate bill of rights, enforceable via nonviolent direct action if the legal system fails. In at least four states, encampments built as bases for pipeline resistance have emerged. The Trans-Pecos Pipeline Nearly all of Texas is webbed with oil and gas pipelines, except for the virtually industry-free Big Bend region, known for its night skies devoid of light pollution. There, another pipeline last stand is underway. It is now 96 percent in the ground, set to be complete in March. It would travel along 148 miles before continuing into Mexico. Still, the resistance operates on a much smaller scale than Standing Rock. A second camp called Camp Toyahvale opened soon after Two Rivers in objection to plans by Apache Corporation to use hydraulic fracturing to access newly discovered oil and gas. For now, it is dedicated to education rather than direct action. For years, the idea of stopping the Trans-Pecos pipeline seemed to be a lost cause, said Glover, who has been trying since 2014. But neighbors once fired up over the project had begun to let it go. But then Orona, head of a group called Society of Native Nations, was called to North Dakota last August by fellow members of the American Indian Movement to fight the Dakota Access pipeline. When he returned, he began protesting at the headquarters of Energy Transfer Partners, which is also in charge of the Trans-Pecos pipeline. He met Glover there. It awaits an Army Corps permit. The 42-inch pipeline is an extension of largest volume natural gas pipeline in the U.S., the Transco line. The line will cross 388 water bodies and 263 acres of forest. The Atlantic Sunrise was okayed on his very last day. The Clean Air Council has pointed to energy analyst predictions that say the area is being overbuilt with pipelines and that markets ultimately will not support the extraction of enough gas to fill the expanding network that includes the Atlantic Sunrise. Video footage of security guards using biting German shepherds to fend off the nonviolent group galvanized people across the U.S. to go to Standing Rock. Standing Rock provided a jolt for the group. Sabal Trail Pipeline Last August, on the same day that Standing Rock Sioux tribal chairman Dave Archambault was arrested in one of the first direct actions to block construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, the Army Corps of Engineers granted the final federal permits needed to construct another pipeline, the Sabal Trail. The 36-inch pipeline, owned by Spectra Energy Partners, NextEra Energy, and Duke Energy, would carry more than a billion cubic feet per day of natural gas along 515 miles from Alabama, through Georgia, to Central Florida. Back in 2014 Ted Turner was already petitioning for an alternative route, worried that his Georgia plantation, where he hunts quail, sat too close to a compressor station that would worsen air quality. Karst is a geological formation made up of limestone or other soluble materials, marked by sinkholes and caverns. The Sierra Club, Flint Riverkeeper, and Chattahoochee Riverkeeper are in the midst of a lawsuit over the construction, arguing in part that FERC did not consider the climate impacts of the pipeline. Meanwhile, construction is underway, and many have turned to direct action. A network of encampments and planning hubs have sprung up since last fall, run by a range of organizers with various missions. Visitors to the Crystal Water camp are trained to recognize construction violations. Four small camps in the Goethe State Forest, called the Heartland camps, are jumping off points for direct action. Visitors are advised to reach out to organizers before coming. The company has not submitted a full application to New York or New Jersey, and this preferred route is not yet the chosen route. According to a draft environmental impact statement from September 2016, the potential route would pass through the Ramapo river basin aquifer system, and over two aqueducts that supply New York City, the Catskill Aqueduct and the Delaware Aqueduct. The company argues that the pipeline is a safer alternative to crude traveling via barges on the Hudson River or by trains. The line would also pass through the Ramapo Mountains. After a visit to Standing Rock last fall, Owl helped his tribe found a camp, called Split Rock Sweetwater, in protest of the Pilgrim pipeline. When he visited North Dakota, Owl presented Standing Rock tribal leaders with a Ramapough-Lunaape resolution banning fossil fuel infrastructure from passing through their traditional territory. Although New Jersey and New York recognize the Ramapough-Lenaape as a tribe, the federal government does not. When leaders applied for recognition in the 1990s, Donald Trump campaigned to stop them, concerned they would open gambling businesses to compete with his Atlantic City casinos.

Not long after Seattle's vote, the City Council in Davis, Calif., took a similar action over the pipeline. On the same day the two cities moved to cut ties with Wells Fargo, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers granted an easement allowing the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross under the Missouri River north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. As NPR's Rebecca Hersher reported, that clears the way for construction of the final 1.5 miles of the nearly 1,200-mile pipeline. Wells Fargo has been in the headlines since last fall over a scandal involving bank employees creating fake accounts in customers' names to bolster performance results and boost bonuses. While other banks are also involved in the pipeline deal, Wells Fargo's recent history seems to have helped make it a target once again. Wells Fargo's commercial banking manager for Washington state, Mary Knell, tells KUOW that she's disappointed in Seattle's new move, noting that the bank is bound by its contract with the pipeline project.

The Belle Fourche Pipeline spilled an estimated 176,400 gallons of oil. A Belle Fourche Pipeline spilled an estimated 176,400 gallons of oil. The rules also enable state inspectors to witness tests performed on the pipeline to check the integrity of the line before it's returned to service. In addition, pipeline owners are now required to report to state officials the root cause of a pipeline spill, allowing regulators to look for trends and work to prevent future incidents. A landowner discovered the leaking Belle Fourche Pipeline on Dec. 5 about 16 miles northwest of Belfield. Belle Fourche, which is part of True Companies of Wyoming, is not likely to repair the pipeline before the stronger pipeline rules take effect on Jan. 1. The hillside where the pipeline break occurred is slumping and concerns about instability of the rugged Badlands terrain have prevented crews from accessing the area. Officials hope a geotechnical evaluation can be performed next week, said Bill Suess, spill investigation program manager for the North Dakota Department of Health. True Companies is focused on cleaning up the environment and investigating the cause of the pipeline break, said spokeswoman Wendy Owen. There have been no discussions so far about putting the pipeline back into service, she said. The 6-inch oil pipeline dates back to the 1980s and Belle Fourche acquired it in the 1990s. The company also owns Bridger Pipeline, which had the January 2015 oil spill of more than 30,000 gallons in the Yellowstone River that contaminated the water supply for Glendive, Mont. In 2011, Dakota Gasification contacted the Public Service Commission after a cave-in left the carbon dioxide pipeline exposed in Dunn County. Dakota Gasification concluded that poor construction methods on the True Companies pipeline caused the cave-in on their parallel pipeline, PSC documents show. Loenbro was the contractor for that segment of the True Companies pipeline, the union said, citing PSC records. Weather conditions also were identified as contributing to the pipeline exposure, The Dickinson Press reported at the time. Dakota Gasification did not file a formal complaint to the PSC. The new pipeline rules, which the labor union supported, will provide stronger oversight and prohibit substandard construction practices, said spokesman Kevin Pranis. A representative for Loenbro did not return a call seeking comment. The Oil and Gas Division has been on site of the Belle Fourche spill and will be monitoring work on the pipeline. Even though some of the new rules don't take effect until Jan. 1, the state already has six pipeline inspectors who have been working in the field to oversee new pipeline construction and repair work, he said. Finding out the cause of pipeline spills should lead to reducing the frequency and severity of spills, said Troy Coons, chairman of the Northwest Landowners Association, which pushed for the new regulations. Companies are now required to tell state regulators the root cause of pipeline spills within 10 days after the cleanup is complete. However, major incidents can take months or years to clean up. In addition to state regulators, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has jurisdiction over the Belle Fourche Pipeline, which the federal agency considers to be a transmission line under its definitions. The agency's requirements vary depending on the circumstances of each incident, but generally the agency could require a test to determine the cause of the pipeline break as well as additional pressure tests or inspections before it can be put back in service. The North Dakota Department of Health and the Environmental Protection Agency also are investigating and monitoring the cleanup."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/265725089t?referring_akid=.6688629.bMJVaX", "Timestamp": "20180919001803", "Sentences": "Credo Action Stop Trump from building the Dakota Access pipeline.

As NPR's Rebecca Hersher reported, that clears the way for construction of the final 1.5 miles of the nearly 1,200-mile pipeline. Wells Fargo has been in the headlines since last fall over a scandal involving bank employees creating fake accounts in customers' names to bolster performance results and boost bonuses. While other banks are also involved in the pipeline deal, Wells Fargo's recent history seems to have helped make it a target once again. Wells Fargo's commercial banking manager for Washington state, Mary Knell, tells KUOW that she's disappointed in Seattle's new move, noting that the bank is bound by its contract with the pipeline project. Socialist City Council member Kshama Sawant, who spearheaded Seattle's move away from Wells Fargo, says a rally against the bank is scheduled for this weekend.

On Wednesday, Jan. 4, the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa passed a formal resolution to not renew Enbridge right-of-way easements for Line 5, which runs from Superior, Wis. to Sarnia, Ontario by way of Michigan. A map of the Enbridge Line 5 pipeline.State of Michigan The tribal council called for the pipeline's removal from all tribal lands and the watershed of the Bad River, which bisects the 124,000-acre reservation located on the shore of Lake Superior in Ashland and Iron counties. The move against Line 5 comes amid a shifting landscape for oil pipelines marked by the successful Standing Rock protest efforts to stall the controversial Energy Transfer Partners' Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota and Enbridge's cancellation of the Sandpiper line to move Bakken oil through Minnesota. Fears about how an oil spill might impact the Great Lakes have stoked a movement against Line 5 in Michigan, where the state is weighing what action, if any, it might take pending the results of an independent risk assessment. Key pieces still absent from Mackinac straits oil spill cleanup readiness Nonetheless, tribal leaders told the Associated Press the move against Line 5 has nothing to do with the other pipeline protests. It plans to reach out to federal, state and local officials for guidance on how to proceed with ejecting the pipeline. The tribe has directed staff to prepare for recycling, disposal and surface restoration work that would accompany removal. The tribe says 15 right-of-way easements for Line 5 expired in 2013 and Enbridge has been in negotiations with them since then to renew those agreements. The tribe owns interest in 11 of 15 parcels that the pipeline crosses. The easements date back 64 years ago to 1953. The Canadian pipeline giant operates a huge cross-border crude oil pipeline network called the Lakehead System across Canada and the U.S. Midwest that moves about 2.8 million barrels of Canadian oil per day into the United States, which is about 60 percent of all Canadian crude moving across the border. Line 5, part of the Lakehead system, moves up to 540,000 barrels of light crude and natural gas liquids per day across the Upper Peninsula, under the Straits of Mackinac and back into Canada at Marysville. On its 645-mile path, Line 5 crosses through more than 23 counties and 360 Michigan waterways. Enbridge said there's never been a Line 5 spill on the Bad River reservation, although Line 5 did rupture and spill five barrels of oil in the U.P.'s Hiawatha National Forest in Delta County around 1980. Other Enbridge Lakehead pipelines have spilled oil in the past decade. In 2012, Enbridge Line 14 spilled 54,000 gallons in New Chester, Wis. Six years after historic oil spill, feds close the book on Enbridge catastrophe In the Straits of Mackinac, Enbridge just completed a fall project to install more screw anchor supports on Line 5 after a June inspection found several areas where the pipeline crossed gaps in the lakebed greater than 75 feet, the maximum unsupported span length allowable under its 1953 easement. In August, Michigan contracted with two companies to conduct independent studies on the pipeline that are expected to be finished in June 2017. Dynamic Risk Assessment Systems of Calgary is evaluating alternatives to the existing twin underwater pipeline segments crossing the lakebed.

Idaho, Wyoming and Utah remain the only states in the West that have declined to expand their Medicaid programs as part of the Affordable Care Act, passing up federal dollars they could have used to offer health coverage to more poor residents. That means that taxpayers in Idaho are helping to fund treatment for patients with opioid addiction in Vermont, while Idahoans with opioid problems may have no such option. Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health policy at George Washington University, said states generally fight to maximize federal funding for their programs. She described Medicaid expansion as a striking counterexample, where political preferences have sometimes outweighed the desire for resources. Medicaid expansion states could keep growing. Voters in Maine last week approved a ballot measure to expand Medicaid. And recent legislative gains by Democrats in Virginia could change the politics of the issue there. Activists in other states, including Kansas, Utah and Idaho, are mobilizing for a renewed expansion push in the coming year. Two-thirds of Utahns support ballot initiative to expand Medicaid, poll says Utahns have shown consistent support for a Medicaid expansion, judging from polls over the past three years.

Their primary fear is that an oil leak would threaten water quality for many members of the tribal community. But shortly after, federal officials said they would temporarily stop construction pending further review. But despite the national attention to this case, one point has gone largely ignored in my view: Stopping DAPL is a matter of climate justice and decolonization for indigenous peoples. It may not always be apparent to people outside these communities, but standing up for water quality and heritage are intrinsically tied to these larger issues. Climate scientists, through organizations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and U.S. Climate Assessment, are finding more evidence of climate change from human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation. These destabilize the climate system, producing environmental conditions that disrupt human societies, through impacts such as rising sea levels, more severe droughts and warming freshwater. The same climate science organizations also show that indigenous peoples are among the populations who will suffer more, on average, than other communities from changing environmental conditions. Some are suffering right now. One of the encampments that has formed along the banks of the Cannon Ball River in North Dakota over the past few months to protest construction of the North Dakota Access Pipeline which would transport oil under the Missouri River above the water access point for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. This is happening in other parts of the world too. DAPL, a 1,172-mile connector of the Bakken and Three Forks fossil fuel basins to major oil refining markets, maintains the carbon energy foundation Wildcat writes of. The protectors, meanwhile, are bringing public attention to the urgency of reducing a fossil fuel dependence. Because indigenous peoples suffer the effects of climate change disproportionately, continuing fossil fuel dependence will inflict more harms in years to come. But there is more to this story, as climate change and U.S. colonialism against indigenous peoples are closely related. It also sheds important light on indigenous understanding of what climate justice really means and what solutions are required.

Eventually, in July, the company abandoned its plans. Plans for a shale gas-fuelled economic revival appear to be evaporating as test wells have not performed as expected or have suffered regulatory delays. Foreign investors have pulled out and sustained environmental protests like that in Zurawlow have hampered drilling plans. In September, 3Legs Resources became the latest firm to call a halt on investments after disappointing results. But with falling oil prices, continued supplies of cheap coal and EU pressure to increase cost-competitive renewable power generation, the shale gas industry needs positive results fast, and less controversy. Multi-billion dollar tax incentives are in the pipeline and a new law should soon speed up permitting processes that can take years. But this has already sparked an EU legal action for allowing firms to drill at depths of up to 5,000m without first assessing environmental risks.

Villagers allege that one woman whose water well became polluted at the same time that seismic tests were being conducted in the area received a building renovation paid for by Chevron, and promptly stopped complaining about the issue. Shortly after that, a local protest leader dropped out of the movement and took up work as a Chevron security guard, leading to accusations that he had been bought off. The company has donated to several charities in the US and Romania, where it has also invested in shale exploration. But in a regional trend, he was deposed in favour of a more shale-sceptic opponent in November, who advanced an alternative geothermal energy-based plan. The ex-mayor was useless.

On March 27th, a train carrying Canadian tar sands dilbit jumped the rails in rural Minnesota spilling an estimated 30,000 gallons of black gold onto the countryside. Two days later a pipeline ruptured in the town of Mayflower, Arkansas, sending a river of Albertan tar sands crude gurgling down residential streets. And news is just breaking about a Shell oil spill that occurred the same day in Texas that dumped an estimated 700 barrels, including at least 60 barrels of oil into a waterway that leads to the Gulf of Mexico (stay tuned for more on that). This week a Canadian Pacific freight train loaded with oil derailed, spilling its cargo over the Northwest Ontario countryside. Originally reported as a leak of 600 liters, the CBC reported on Thursday that the estimated volume of the spill has increased to 63,000 liters. As lobbying efforts around the stymied Keystone XL and Northern Gateway pipelines intensify, oil companies have been quietly loading their toxic cargo onto freight trains. There has been a marked boost in the rail transport of crude in the last three years as new extraction techniques increase production in the tar sands. The company hopes to increase that number to over 70,000 this year. Most, if not all, advocates of pipeline transportation will argue that the growing use of rail transport emphasizes the urgent need for pipelines. Pipelines are commonly touted as a more reliable mode of fuel transport than rail. Pipelines, as the story goes, are safe. In fact, pipelines have made a pretty consistent mess throughout the States for the last 20 years. One thing has changed, however: those messes are getting more expensive to clean up. In terms of property damage PHMSA records indicate that the 20-year average (1993-2012) cost of significant pipeline incidents is over 318 million dollars, the 10-year average (2003-2012) cost is over 494 million dollars the 5-year average (2008-2012) cost is over 545 million dollars and the 3-year average (2010-2012) cost is over 662 million dollars. The cost of cleaning up after pipelines just keeps getting more expensive. On average during this time period there were more than 250 pipeline incidents per year, without a single year where that number dropped below 220. During that time, more than 2.5 million barrels of hazardous liquids were spilled and little more than half of those spilled amounts were recovered in cleanup efforts. Companies eager to move Canadian dilbit south to refineries and export facilities have been jimmying an aging pipeline infrastructure to handle the more corrosive substance and there is currently no federal oversight to monitor this process. Pipeline Network by Petroleum GeoGraphics Corp. on NRP. Two decades of pipeline spills, mapped by the New York Times. Built in the late 1940s, the old winged horse of a pipeline was reversed in 2006 in order to carry Canadian dilbit to the Gulf Coast via Illinois at a 50 percent increased capacity. The burst line sent a river of at least 84,000 gallons of dilbit running down residential streets in Mayflower and into nearby wetlands. The exact cause of the pipeline rupture is still unknown. Both Exxon and Enbridge have been told their actions in the immediate hours after pipeline ruptures have made spills worse than necessary. In many cases companies performed inspections and discovered cracks and corrosion in the line but did not perform repairs before accidents occurred. At least, not for the residents of Mayflower.

Donald Trump is already proving to be the dangerous threat to our climate we feared he would be. But, these pipelines are far from being a certainty. From the plains of Nebraska and North Dakota to the streets of New York to the halls of Congress, millions of Americans and hundreds of Tribes have stood up to block these dirty pipelines and their voices will not be silenced. We will continue to fight these dangerous projects. The Keystone XL pipeline was rejected because it was not in the country's interest, and the environmental review of the Dakota Access Pipeline was ordered because of the threats it poses to the Standing Rock Sioux. Nothing has changed. These pipelines were a bad idea then and they're a bad idea now. It would carry and emit the climate equivalent of 37.7 million cars' annual emissions each year -- a disaster for our climate. TransCanada, the foreign company behind the Keystone XL project, will attempt to use eminent domain to sue American landowners and seize their private property in order to pipe this dirty fuel across the U.S. for export. The 1,168-mile Dakota Access Pipeline could carry 450,000 barrels of fracked oil every day through four states. It would cut through communities, farms, sensitive natural areas, wildlife habitat, and tribal lands like the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's ancestral lands. It would also cross under the Missouri River just upstream of the Tribe's drinking water supply, where a spill would mean a serious threat to the Tribe's health, culture, and way of life.

Approving the Keystone XL pipeline means the American people will have to pay for the financial and environmental costs of a Canadian pipeline and that goes against our national interests. TransCanada, the foreign oil company behind the Keystone XL project, continues to bully American landowners with eminent domain to seize their private property in order to pipe this dirty fuel across the US. I call on you to stand with the American people, to stand strong against dirty trade deals, like the TPP, not with a foreign oil company. Similarly, the Dakota Access Pipeline tramples on the rights of Native Americans by putting corporate interests above Tribal treaty rights and clean water. The pipeline was originally proposed to cross the Missouri River just above Bismarck, ND, but after complaints, it was rerouted to cross the river along sacred Tribal grounds, less than a mile from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines encourage dirty, dangerous tar sands development, when clean energy is growing faster, producing more jobs, and has a real future. I call on you to support the growth of clean energy jobs and businesses, not dirty pipelines. The American people are counting on you to protect American landowners and Native American tribal interests from oil companies trying to steal and threaten their land by constructing dirty and dangerous pipelines through it. I call on you to protect our clean air and water by not permitting a tar sands superhighway that will endanger both and hasten the climate crisis. These pipelines are not in our national interest.

This Dec. 10, 2016 photo provided by the North Dakota Department of Health shows an oil spill from the Belle Fourche Pipeline that was discovered Dec. 5 in Ash Coulee Creek, a tributary of the Little Missouri River, near Belfield, N.D. The discovery of the pipeline spill in western North Dakota has drawn heightened attention because of the battle over the Dakota Access oil pipeline being built across the state. While the spill was on a different pipeline, the Standing Rock Sioux and its supporters say a spill on the Dakota Access pipeline could threaten the tribe's drinking water, which is drawn from the Missouri River. About 176,000 gallons of oil spilled, with about 130,000 gallons that flowed into Ash Coulee Creek. A photo released by the North Dakota Department of Health shows the brown muck on the creek's surface, and another photo shows what appears to be the pipeline break with oil oozing out. As of Wednesday, about 46,000 gallons had been recovered. Regulators don't expect the cleanup to be completed until spring. It appears no oil got into the Little Missouri River, and no drinking water sources were threatened, according to Bill Suess, an environmental scientist with the health department. The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over. The spill was in a remote area of the southwest part of the state, far from any major population centers. It fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. A landowner spotted the spill Dec. 5. Electronic monitoring equipment failed to detect the rupture, but it's not clear why, according to Wendy Owen, a spokeswoman for Casper, Wyoming-based True Cos., which operates the pipeline. The pipeline was shut down as soon as the leak was discovered. Owen said erosion of a hillside might have ruptured the pipe, but the cause is still being investigated. It's sizeable, but there have been much larger oil spills in North Dakota. In September 2013, a Tesoro Corp. pipeline break spilled more than 840,000 gallons of oil into a wheat field near Tioga. That spill is still being cleaned up. True Cos. has a history of spills in North Dakota and Montana, including a January 2015 pipeline break into the Yellowstone River. That 32,000-gallon spill temporarily shut down water supplies in the downstream community of Glendive, Montana, after oil was detected in the city's water treatment system. It's much smaller. The 6-inch steel Belle Fourche Pipeline, built in the 1980s, is mostly underground but crosses Ash Coulee Creek above ground. It's one of a network of thousands of miles of similar pipelines that crisscross western North Dakota's oil patch to pick up oil from wells and carry it to collection points, where it ultimately moves into larger pipelines or railroad tankers destined for refineries across the U.S. The Dakota Access pipeline is a 30-inch steel pipeline that will carry nearly 20 million gallons of North Dakota oil daily through South Dakota and Iowa to a shipping point in Illinois. It is largely complete except for a segment, blocked by the federal government, that's near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, where it would be buried 90 to 115 feet below Lake Oahe. Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners says the line will have modern leak detection equipment, and that workers monitoring the pipeline remotely could close valves within three minutes if a breach was detected. The Standing Rock tribe argues that putting the pipeline under the lake imperils drinking water for more than 8,000 tribal members and millions downstream. ETP and other pipeline advocates maintain that transporting oil through pipelines is safer than shipping it by truck or train. Recently Viewed Your list is empty.

The planned action could escalate into confrontation as opponents of the project are determined to stop construction, said Chief Bob Chamberlain, vice-president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs. Opponents of the pipeline expansion demonstrated on Burnaby Mountain three years ago, and more than 100 people were arrested for refusing police orders to disperse. Smaller protests have sprung up in recent months around Kinder Morgan's Burnaby terminal, as the company continues to obtain permits from the B.C. government for preconstruction activity. On Tuesday, the Tsleil Waututh will put out a call to allied nations and supporters of environmental organization, with organizers saying their network will reach some 200,000 Canadians. The planned pipeline expansion has sparked an interprovincial battle between the British Columbia government, which opposes the project, and Alberta, which argues its oil industry desperately needs access to Pacific Rim markets in order to receive world prices for its crude. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was in Nanaimo, B.C., last week defending his government's decision to approve the project that he insists is in the national interest, while pledging to protect the coast from risks of a spill because of increased tanker traffic. Story continues below advertisement Story continues below advertisement At an energy conference in Ottawa, several industry speakers said the Trans Mountain project is a key marker for the Liberal government, arguing that Ottawa's response in the face of opposition will determine whether Canada can complete controversial resource projects. Mr. Trudeau should not leave Alberta to lead the defence of the project that Ottawa has declared to be in the national interest, said Martha Hall Findlay, president of Calgary-based Canada West Foundation. Instead, Ottawa must send a strong message that neither protesters nor the B.C. government will be allowed to derail the expansion, she told the Energy Council of Canada meeting. At the town hall session in Nanaimo last week, the Prime Minister was jeered when he defended the government's decision. Story continues below advertisement The government is failing in its pledge of reconciliation by approving the Trans Mountain expansion project over the objections of several local First Nation communities, he said. The government has committed to respecting the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which includes the principle that First Nations people be afforded the right to free, prior and informed consent over projects that impact their traditional territory. Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr has said the UN principle provides for fuller consultation and partnership over decision-making, but does not provide any one Indigenous community with a veto over a project that is in the national interest.

The proposed expansion, which would run for 1,150 kilometres from central Alberta to Burnaby, B.C., requires construction of approximately 994 kilometres of new pipeline across more than 500 watercourses, roughly half of which support habitat for recreational, economic and culturally important fish species. Tripling oil capacity from 300,000 barrels to 890,000 barrels per day, the new pipeline would cross roughly 250 streams and rivers that support spawning salmon in the Fraser River watershed. The increased capacity would also necessitate a dramatic increase in the number of oil tankers transiting the waters of the Salish Sea. It supports dozens of unique populations of Pacific salmon, including interior and coastal populations of steelhead and trout. Overall, the Fraser River and its tributaries are home to 42 different species of fish. However, many of these species and populations now face a crisis due to decades of habitat loss, overfishing and, more recently, climate change. Given the year-round presence of salmon in the Lower Fraser and the potential consequences of exposure to diluted bitumen, there is no time when the risk to salmon is low or acceptable. Whether as embryos, juveniles or adults, salmon are present in the Lower Fraser River every month of the year, using the river and its estuary for migration, rearing and spawning. With nine species of salmon and trout spawning in the tributaries of the Lower Fraser River and using the main channels and sloughs to rear, a spill of diluted bitumen into the river or its tributaries would be catastrophic, rendering many of these areas unsuitable for the growth and survival of salmon embryos and fry. Once on these shores, it will be extremely challenging, if not impossible, to recover that oil. Unfortunately, many juvenile salmon species are particularly vulnerable to oil spills in the Fraser estuary, and other estuaries in the Salish Sea, as they rely on its sheltered habitats for extended periods when young. It may be impossible for them to avoid spilled oil as they adapt to life in saltwater. This report comes at a time when one third of the wild salmon populations in the Fraser River are considered at risk of extinction. Given this reality, a precautionary approach indicates that there is no time when the risk to salmon from exposure to spilled oil is low.

The company that is building the controversial Keystone XL pipeline no doubt wishes Energy Secretary Rick Perry had been right last week when he explained the law of supply and demand. In fact, as any first-year economics student learns, supply follows demand. Perry could call TransCanada Corp. of Calgary, Alberta, for verification. There it would link up with existing pipelines that would carry the thick, high-sulfur, tar-sands oil to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Since its inception in 2008, the project has been dogged by environmental concerns that brought opposition from the Obama administration. President Donald Trump greenlighted it in March. But now, The Wall Street Journal reports the law of supply and demand has raised its ugly head. TransCanada is having trouble getting commitments from oil companies to use the pipeline. Firms would rather take their chances on spot-market oil, even if they have to pay more to transport it, than risk long-term commitments to the Canadian oil. In February, the falling demand for Canadian oil led ExxonMobil to write off its entire 3.5 billion barrels of estimated reserves in Alberta oil. The pipeline investment must be amortized over 50 years, by which time global warming will be impossible to ignore. Just like the law of supply and demand. This can be removed when origin is fixed.

A third, known leak occurred on April 4 in South Dakota, where two barrels (84 gallons) spilled at a pump station. The North Dakota Environmental Health Chief, Dave Glatt, told the Associated Press that all spills are listed on their online database, but they don't usually notify the public unless the leaks involve at least 150 barrels (6,300 gallons or 23,848 litres), or the oil has made its way into the waterways.

The large-scale demonstration marked the 100th day of President Trump's first 100 days in office. Protesters had chanted and sung, carried clever signs, Snapchatted and tweeted their way down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. Now, the streets of Washington were quiet. The crowds had mostly gone home. Trump was still in the White House. Republicans still controlled Congress. Part of the answer, they hoped, was in this room. They would spend the day learning the ins and outs of running for office at every level of government, from fundraising to organizing to connecting with voters. Rather, he said it also was intended to jump-start the building of a stronger, more diverse, more strategic environmental movement. That includes training candidates for office at the local, state and national level. It also includes amplifying the voices of people in minority and indigenous communities who have been disproportionately affected by pollution and global warming. And, ultimately, it includes persuading elected officials that their constituents care deeply about environmental issues. But he added that change is possible, even during an administration that is less than friendly to environmental causes. He pointed to the Richard Nixon era, when widespread anger over pollution, smog and unsafe water prompted the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency. They certainly have their work cut out for them. The administration has announced it will reconsider stricter fuel-efficiency standards for cars and light trucks. It has approved two major oil pipelines, Dakota Access and Keystone XL, that President Barack Obama had halted. An office that focuses on environmental justice issues would vanish. So would the Energy Star program. The White House has yet to say whether it intends to pull the nation out of the Paris climate accord, under which almost every country agreed in 2015 to begin slashing emissions of carbon dioxide to slow global warming. Even if the United States technically remains part of the international agreement, it almost certainly will no longer play the leading role it did under Obama. Back inside Union Station on Sunday, the talk was more of local action than global action. But that remaining on the sidelines was no longer an option.

Blood samples were taken from each of the 16 participants both after they drank a cocktail containing BPA and at a separate visit, after they drank an identical cocktail that did not contain BPA. And participants who already had relatively poor blood sugar control seemed more sensitive to BPA's effects. In late pregnancy, hormonal changes are believed to push a woman into a temporary state of insulin resistance in order to ensure enough sugar gets across the placenta to her rapidly growing fetus. The authors posed the possibility that BPA, if mistaken for a steroid by the body, could trigger similar effects. Saal and several other scientists have been working with the FDA on another first-of-its kind study to tease out the true impacts of BPA. The project, called Consortium Linking Academic and Regulatory Insights on BPA Toxicity, or CLARITY-BPA, was launched with intent of helping government regulators and academic researchers reach a consensus on BPA's potential health harms. Academic researchers have voiced concerns that government regulators are again discounting their findings in favor of the FDA's own conclusions, which remain that BPA is safe.

They had one of the best band logos in the world, designed by comix artist Gary Panter of Jimbo renown. We thought the Screamers and Tomata du Plenty were fucking unbelievable. They were so way ahead of their time. They were using rudimentary synths and sequencers but with punk energy and aggressive lyrics and theatrical staging with German expressionist lighting. Tomata had been banging around the Seattle scene in the early 1970s before relocating to L.A. After the Screamers broke up in 1981, he switched his attention to painting. Sadly, in August 2000, Tomata died of cancer at the age of 52. At some point in the 1990s he executed a series of punk rock portraits, for lack of a better description, featuring people from the L.A. punk scene as well as other rock and roll luminaries (and, randomly, the 19th-century French author Guy de Maupassant).

AIM, the target of ongoing protests in the Hudson Valley (NY) and elsewhere, would run from central New Jersey to ports in the Boston, MA area, passing within a few hundred feet of Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant on the Hudson River. The Sabal Trail project is touted by Spectra to be crucial to aiding economic development along its route, and fueling gas-fired power generators in the Southeast United States. Environmentalists, however, view the project quite differently. Such development plans rarely come without a cost to communities, and to the environment. A Unique Geology Reflecting its geological origins as part of a shallow ancient ocean, the southeastern United States is underlain by porous limestone bedrock, known as karst. Water running through the karst bedrock flows not only through small pores, but often through extensive underground caves. When under under pressure, water can bubble up to the surface in a multitude of freshwater springs throughout the region. Recognizing these risks, opponents of the Sabal Trail pipeline frequently cite the inherent danger of pipelines bending and rupturing should the ground beneath them give way, leading to potentially dangerous gas leakages or explosions. One piece of recent research from the University of Georgia maps the prevalence of sinkholes in Doughterty County, GA, one of the many counties the Sabal Trail pipeline would pass through. Karst geology, documented sinkholes, and springs near the route of the pipeline are also shown. The double-arrows in the upper right corner of the map will launch a full-screen view of the map, including a map legend. Two months later, however, in mid-December, the EPA suddenly reversed its position. Currently, the construction is proceeding. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has granted eminent domain to industry to build the project through seized private property. Although all federal permits for the pipeline construction are in place, a joint lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club, the Gulf Restoration Network, and Flint Riverkeeper has challenged that permitting process. Sabal Trail gas pipeline noise pollution at the Santa Fe River (Nov. 25, 2016). Water Protectors As winter descends on the northern Plains, thousands of indigenous people representing hundreds of tribes, as well as non-Native allies, have gathered in camps near the Sioux Standing Rock Reservation to pray and protest the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which would drill an oil pipeline through sacred Native lands and under the Missouri River. Hundreds of arrests of peaceful protesters have been made there in recent months, many resulting in serious injuries to the protesters as water cannons, rubber bullets, concussion grenades, and attack dogs have been used in efforts to intimidate the activists. Coordination among First Nations groups against other fossil fuel infrastructure is happening elsewhere, too. For example, in September 2016, at least fifty US and Canadian aboriginal groups signed a treaty, saying they will work together to fight proposals that would bring crude oil from the Alberta tar sands via pipeline, tanker, and rail. The protests against the Sabal Trail Project are similarly themed to those at Standing Rock, but have not resulted in violence towards protesters thus far. Along the Suwanee River in Florida, peaceful protesters have assembled at the Sacred Waters encampment and, on November 12, 2016, faced off with authorities in an effort to stop pipeline drilling under the Santa Fe River between Branford and Fort White, Florida. No arrests were made on that day. Still other protests about the potential environmental risks posed by the Sabal Trail have taken place recently in both Orlando and Live Oak, Florida. Even in the phases of construction, environmentalists in Georgia discovered that the Sabal Trail pipeline had started leaking drilling mud from a pilot hole into the Withlacooche River in late October, and continued to ooze turbid mud for at least three weeks.

Winter weather was affecting the company's ability to estimate how much oil had been released, said Wendy Owen, spokeswoman for True Companies. The incident was reported by a landowner who saw oil leaking from the 6-inch pipeline into the creek, Suess said. A labor union, which opposed a True Companies pipeline under consideration by the North Dakota Public Service Commission in 2015, issued a statement Tuesday urging regulators to have stronger oversight over the company. The Laborers District Council of Minnesota and North Dakota, which has members working on the Dakota Access Pipeline, said True Companies has a poor track record of spills and environmental incidents. Dakota Access protesters camped in south central North Dakota often cite the company's 30,000-gallon oil spill in the Yellowstone River as an example of why they oppose a pipeline crossing the Missouri River north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.

Big Eagle said in an interview. That turned out to be a 200,000-litre pool of crude coating a frozen pond, a few hundred metres off the road on Ocean Man First Nation territory. The pipeline spill, discovered on Jan. 20, is now under investigation by the Saskatchewan government. It said its investigation will try to determine why the pipeline's leak detection system did not flag the leak. Tundra Energy Marketing, the operator of the pipeline, did not return messages for comment. The spill has cast a spotlight on the problems with detecting pipeline leaks, an issue that will become more important with approvals in place to build the Trans Mountain expansion and Line 3 replacement. The two projects would be the first oil export pipelines to start construction in Canada since 2008. In the U.S., where pipeline data is centrally tracked, a study in 2012 for the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration showed the operators' control rooms detected 17 per cent of oil spills. In Canada, the National Energy Board only started in 2015 to track in detail how leaks are discovered. Still, the NEB data is similar to that of the U.S., with control rooms detecting 20 of the 128 leaks of oil, gas and other substances in the past two years. The Alberta Energy Regulator does not track in its database how leaks are discovered along the pipelines it oversees in the province, though companies are required to submit that information in spill reports. In Saskatchewan, the provincial government asks who submits a spill report but does not require details on how a leak was detected. The Alberta regulator has looked into leak detection on occasion. Last year, it chastised operators for not maintaining effective programs after finding that improper leak detection was a significant contributing factor in eight of 23 pipeline spills it had investigated since 2013. Shortcomings in the control room have been flagged in a number of high-profile spills in the past, including the Husky Energy leak of 225,000 litres last year on the banks of the North Saskatchewan River, where operators waited 10 hours to heed alarm bells and shut off the pipeline. In 2010, operators at Enbridge took 17 hours to shut down a pipeline after being alerted to a spill. About 3.3 million litres of crude flowed into Michigan's Kalamazoo River, the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history. Enbridge said it has made significant changes to its spill response since then. Anthony Swift at the Natural Resource Defense Council of New York said leak detection systems are only able to reliably discover massive spills, but they do little if anything to warn of smaller leaks that can also cause damage. For its 760,000 barrel-a-day Line 3 replacement, Enbridge estimates its system will be able to detect leaks of a minimum 150,000 litres of oil per hour, or roughly three per cent of pipeline flow. Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain expansion should be able to detect leaks of between two and five per cent of flow, which works out to a minimum of 78,200 litres per hour based on the 590,000 barrel-a-day expansion. The technology exists to improve those detection rates with a wide variety of sensors running outside the pipelines including vapour-sensing tubes, fibre-optic temperature monitors, hydrocarbon-sensing cables and acoustic systems. Enbridge, Kinder Morgan and TransCanada have been testing those systems in a joint industry project that started in 2014. But neither company has committed to using the systems on new pipelines. Instead, they say they will rely largely on a multitude of sensors already needed in pipelines that measure flow rate, pressure, temperature and other indicators, which are plugged into computer models and monitored from the control room to try to detect problems. The companies say they will supplement those systems by occasionally running sensitive acoustic devices through the pipelines, plus through ground and air surveillance patrols, to help detect smaller leaks. Kinder Morgan has also committed to installing a second software-based modelling system on its line. In approving Line 3 and the Trans Mountain expansion,the NEB found both they had acceptable leak detection systems and has left it up to their respective companies to decide if they think the more sensitive externally-based sensors are worth the investment. The two companies said they need more time before deciding if they plan to go ahead with any of the new systems.

Updated January 26, 2017 at 10:22 AM; Posted January 25, 2017 at 11:52 AM Donald Trump signs Keystone order President Donald Trump shows his signature on an executive order on the Keystone XL pipeline, one of several orders he says will help American workers and industry. WASHINGTON -- The Keystone XL pipeline stole the show Tuesday with President Donald Trump's executive order to proceed with the project that will pipe Canadian tar sands oil through the United States to Gulf of Mexico refineries. Trump's green light on that and the Dakota Access pipeline, which will pipe oil from the shale fields of North Dakota to Illinois, meant little directly for Ohio. He ordered the commerce secretary to develop a policy requiring U.S.-made steel for new and retrofitted pipelines. A potential long-term beneficiary is the Vallourec Star steel pipe plant in Youngstown, says Philip Bell, president of the Washington, D.C.-based Steel Manufacturers Association. The plant is owned by a French company, but the Youngstown workers are American. Here are some answers. Trump has nominated Wilbur Ross, a wealthy investor who used to scoop up distressed companies and restructure them, for commerce secretary. It is unclear what, exactly Ross will do in terms of this order. But Ross knows the steel industry. Ross bought the bankrupt Cleveland-based LTV Steel and several other companies and ultimately sold them to ArcelorMittal, extracting worker concessions but keeping steel mills running. That's to be seen. The Commerce Department, working with other government agencies, has up to 180 days to develop the plan and submit it to the president. Yes and no. Consider pledges made earlier for steel used in the Keystone XL pipeline. The builder, TransCanada Corp., said in 2012 that half of the pipe for the United States portions, or 332,800 tons, would come from a company in Arkansas, and the rest would come from Canada, Italy and India. The raw steel for the pipe, in other words, could have been melted and poured -- a labor- and financially intensive process -- anywhere in the world before being shipped to the United States for fabrication. That happens a lot, according to authorities on manufacturing. Nevertheless, the finished pipe still would have counted toward that old 50 percent pledge by TransCanada. That's why the Alliance for American Manufacturing says it hopes the Commerce Department will require that every step of the process occurs in the United States, supporting many more American workers. Yes. Miles of pipe was already laid for the Dakota Access project before it stalled amid Native American protests over environmental safety and proximity to sacred burial lands. As USA Today reported, 90 percent of the project is already completed across its four-state route. And only 57 percent of that steel is American-made, short of Trump's 100-percent goal. That's unlikely. Ohio ranks second in the country in steel production, behind Indiana, according to the Ohio Steel Council. It made 12 percent of the steel in the United States in 2011. The industry -- both raw steel and steel product manufacturing -- employed 115,000 Americans in 2011. Coming less than a week into Trump's presidency, the order signals that the president is serious about his campaign commitment to put American workers first. Brown has pushed to require that all government-funded projects use American materials if possible, but has failed to get the Republican majority in Congress to go along. Hold on. The order concerns pipes, so it is not an edict covering everything the government oversees. Republicans in Congress have gone along with exceptions from time to time, so this is not novel. A bigger debate could come when Trump presents a plan to rebuild the nation's roads and bridges, as he says he will. He has not released details. Some conservatives, and some businesses, say builders should have access to the best materials at the best price, period. It's why appliance manufacturers, for example, tend to fight trade decisions that could limit access to cheaper foreign steel. Not by itself. First, remember, most of the Dakota Access pipeline is complete. There also happens to be a surplus of cheap foreign pipe already sitting in warehouses and on docks, Bell said. These are all details the industry has not had time to assess. There could always be other pipeline construction, of course. But that will depend on energy prices -- and right now, low energy prices have suppressed demand for new pipelines and the necessary steel, authorities from steel and manufacturing interests say.

Local news KXII News 12 in Sherman reports that the Blue Ridge spill was caused by a subcontractor who hit the pipeline with a tractor during a road widening construction project. Video of the spill shows a geyser spouting oil from the pipe several feet into the air and landing on U.S. Highway 121, causing local law enforcement to shut down the road. Of course, local officials have claimed minimal environmental impact in the spill and zero impact to the local drinking water. Enterprise is based in Houston, Texas. Enbridge is based in Canada. What was not widely reported at the time was the fact that the Seaway pipeline had experienced a leak at a hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, just three months earlier in late October. KOCO News 5 in Oklahoma states that the spill in Cushing released less than 50,000 gallons of oil and was quickly contained. Fox 4 News reports that although a man identified as an employee of Enterprise barred people from crossing the highway to the Blue Ridge spill, Plano-based environmental activist Jesse Puente was able to cross over and examine the pipeline spill, where he found pools of oil mixed with water. The Trump administration approved the Dakota Access pipeline just days after the Blue Ridge accident, angering the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and environmental activists known as water protectors. According to a study by Auburn University, if an oil pipeline bursts, it can create a serious health hazard for those who live near it. Crude oil, which is the type of oil spilled near Blue Ridge, contains more than 1,000 chemicals hazardous to humans, such as the carcinogen benzene. It is this reason that the Standing Rock Sioux have fought against the DAPL since last spring. While the Blue Ridge pipeline trails along a major highway in Texas, the DAPL is set to go under Lake Oahe, which provides water to Standing Rock and to millions of people down river. If the DAPL bursts beneath Lake Oahe, the oil and the chemicals in it could leach into the water, rendering it undrinkable. Two months ago, another oil pipeline 150 miles from Standing Rock burst, spilling oil and chemicals into the water, according to a piece in the Inquisitr. Although the Blue Ridge Seaway pipeline accident is far from Standing Rock, it is just one in a series of thousands of pipeline incidents in the last 20 years."}, {"URL": "https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/bayer-monsanto-roundup-1.4783530", "Timestamp": "20180918230926", "Sentences": "It did not negotiate any payments from Monsanto shareholders for Roundup-related litigation.

After the verdict in favour of a California school groundskeeper with terminal cancer, Monsanto faces more than 5,000 similar lawsuits across the United States over claims it did not warn of the cancer risks of glyphosate-based weedkillers, including its Roundup brand. The case by plaintiff Dewayne Johnson, filed in 2016, was fast-tracked for trial due to the severity of his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph system that he alleges was caused by Roundup and Ranger Pro, another Monsanto glyphosate herbicide. No significant link between Monsanto weedkiller and cancer in farm workers, study suggests Having closed the Monsanto takeover, Bayer is only awaiting the approval of some final antitrust-related asset sales before folding it into its own organisation. It did not negotiate any payments from Monsanto shareholders for Roundup-related litigation. Bayer shares were on track to close at their lowest in almost five years. Nearly a third of food samples in CFIA testing contain glyphosate residues The controversy could also affect future revenues. Genetically modified (GM) crops that withstand glyphosate are a main source of cash for Monsanto, mainly generated in North and South America, where the technology is widely accepted. The health worries could further darken the outlook for a product category following the emergence of weeds that have grown resistant to the herbicide. Discovered by the Monsanto chemist John E. Franz in 1970, patent-free glyphosate herbicides are now sold by the global crop protection industry despite the dispute over its safety. The U.S. court ruling caught many Bayer investors off guard as no hard evidence of a causal link to cancer had been produced so far. A Reuters report in October showed that the WHO's cancer agency dismissed and edited findings from a draft of its review of glyphosate that were at odds with its final conclusion that the chemical probably causes cancer. In Europe, the EU Commission in December drew criticism for renewing the licence for glyphosate. Germany and France have meanwhile taken steps to phase out use of the weedkiller. The U.S. case may prompt some retailers to curb sales of Roundup products. Homebase, one of Britain's largest home and garden improvement retailers, is reviewing the sale of glyphosate-containing products in the light of the jury's decision, a spokeswoman said. Glyphosate-exposed stocks also plunged in Asia and particularly in Australia where a withering drought has already hit herbicide sales. Australian chemical maker Nufarm Ltd, which Macquarie Bank analysts estimate earns about a fifth of its revenue from glyphosate-based products, plunged almost 17 per cent to a more than two-year low.

Elsewhere, however, expansion of U.S. fossil fuel infrastructure continues. In order to reduce its dependence on South American and Middle Eastern oil, the United States is turning to domestic energy sources that are especially toxic to the environment. A recent gas pipeline rupture in Alabama brought into sharp relief the threats the Dakota Access pipeline and many similar projects pose for crucial waterways and vulnerable ecosystems. In January, the North Dakota Public Service Commission, with approval from area tribes, granted permits to Sacagawea Pipeline Co. to build a crude oil pipeline that crosses Lake Sakakawea, an important reservoir in the state. The Sacagawea pipeline would transport 140,000 barrels of oil per day to a railway line owned by Phillips 66. In addition to pipelines, oil trains are also a major source of concern for environmental safety activists due to their potential for devastating and explosive derailments. On Sept. 6, the Lebanon Hills pipeline received final approval for construction to begin in Dakota County, Minnesota, south of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Bad news. The Sabal Trail Pipeline, a joint project of Spectra Energy Corp, NextEra Energy, Inc., and Duke Energy, is also sparking outcry from concerned residents and environmental justice activists. In October 2015, four congressmen from Georgia wrote a joint letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission expressing their concerns.

Oil usually floats because it is less dense than the water it is floating on. These oils will float in either a river or the ocean. Sometimes the density of an oil is so close to that of river water that the oil moves along the river partly underwater. This doesn't happen very often, but it's something we have to think about whenever oil is spilled in a river. If spilled oil sinks, it can be very difficult to clean up. If something causes it to pool on the bottom (for example, it may get trapped behind a sunken vessel), then vacuum devices can be used to try and get the oil off the bottom. As you might guess, this method may not be very effective because vacuums may capture a lot of water and sand along with the oil. Movement is usually downstream. Unlike in a bay or the open ocean, currents in a river are generally directed downstream (except very close to the mouth of the river, where it enters the ocean; here, a flood tide might actually reverse the flow of the surface water). The greater predictability of river currents makes it easier to forecast which way the oil will move. Wind blowing across the river also affects where the oil will come ashore. If the wind is blowing straight down the river (as might happen on a river with high banks), it often will travel quite far down the river before it comes in contact with a beach. In order for the oil to beach, the wind must blow the oil to one side of the river or the other. You can see how the wind affects movement of an oil slick by looking at some predictions from GNOME, our oil spill trajectory model. (NOAA) Dams and locks influence oil movement. Rivers sometimes contain dams or locks that slow or divert water flow. Dams and locks also slow down the movement of spilled oil. Vegetation may grow right at the water's edge. Along many rivers, plants and trees grow right up to the river's edge. Those rivers don't have the open, sandy shores that you find along many parts of the open coast. It's much harder to remove oil from vegetation than from a hard-packed sand beach. Spill responders try to protect the plants by using booms, but if the vegetation gets oiled, responders often either cut, burn, or flush it with water to try to get the oil out. Oil can interact with sediment carried by rivers. Rivers often carry a lot of sediment in their currents. That means when oil droplets drift into the water column of a river, the sediment has the potential to stick to the oil droplets. Eventually (depending on how strong-flowing and full of sediment a river is) some of the oil-sediment combination may settle out to the bottom of the river, usually near the river mouth as the water slows down and reaches the ocean.

Epping Transmission Co. proposes to build a pipeline that could deliver 30,000 barrels of oil per day, with a maximum capacity of 70,000 barrels, to the Dakota Access Pipeline terminal near Epping, about 20 miles northeast of Williston. Meadowlark Midstream, another subsidiary of Summit Midstream, continues to be under investigation by the federal Environmental Protection Agency and North Dakota regulators for the spill discovered in January 2015 north of Williston that contaminated Blacktail Creek and eventually the Little Muddy and Missouri rivers. The North Dakota Industrial Commission alleges the pipeline was leaking for more than three months before the spill was discovered. Remediation of the site is ongoing. The same pipeline system leaked again a year later, but that time staff recognized an anomaly with the pipeline within an hour and had the system shut down within a few hours, an indication that the company's pipeline monitoring system works, testified Zak Cobar, a vice president for Summit. In addition to around-the-clock pipeline monitoring, Summit said it has adopted a policy for hiring responsible contractors and requiring best practices. That policy would not technically apply to the Epping project because it is a smaller project and doesn't meet a cost threshold in the policy, said Megan Davis, a vice president and assistant general counsel. However, there is an expectation that the company comply with the spirit of the new policy, which Davis said is their intention. The company applied for the project in late August and can't begin construction until the commission issues a permit. Michael Smith, senior vice president for of corporate development, said the construction timeline is not finalized because the completion date for Dakota Access is unknown. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continues to review the easement for the Lake Oahe crossing north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where demonstrations have been active since Aug. 10. Smith said the project will take about four months to complete and the company would like to have it ready when Dakota Access becomes operational. The project is the sixth short pipeline to connect with Dakota Access that the commission has considered. Three have been constructed, one is under construction and another has been approved but construction is not expected to start until next spring. Commissioners requested additional information before they will make a decision on the Epping project, including detailed information about how the company would handle winter construction."}, {"URL": "http://share.credoaction.com/265342254t?referring_akid=.2305340.RVyWGB", "Timestamp": "20180918231019", "Sentences": "Credo Action Stop Trump from building the Dakota Access pipeline.

If they were, there would be a way to reason with them. Compromise would be possible because governments and pipeline builders could agree to thicker pipeline walls, real-time leak detection and diversion around sensitive waterways and forests. But activists are not simply worried about damage during construction, about ruptures and spills during operation or about the intrusion of pipeline rights-of-way through First Nations and provincial parks. They have convinced themselves that oil and other fossil fuels threaten the very existence of life on earth. In their opinion, if the oil in the pipelines is ever converted to energy the emissions given off will cause catastrophic climate change. Eco-activists believe pipelines must be stopped because the oil in them must be prevented from ever being used in factories, power plants, petrochemicals and vehicles. This week, University of Alberta mechanical engineering prof Amit Kumar published a study in the Journal of Environmental Science and Technology. His research shows that pipelines are not only the safest means of transporting vast quantities of oil, they are also the most environmentally friendly. Kumar looked at the environmental impact of everything from manufacturing pipe versus making tanker railcars to constructing pipelines and pumping oil through them versus hauling oil by train. Since the pipeline announcement on Tuesday, many observers (me among them) had assumed the federal Liberal government lacked the guts to use force against pipeline disrupters. The Libs approved the two pipelines but would never see their construction through. Yet there was Carr saying Ottawa was prepared to call out the RCMP and even the army if environmentalists chained themselves to bulldozers or vandalized pipe and equipment. Carr and other Liberals walked back his statement a little on Friday. People who attempt to halt the construction of an approved pipeline will be dealt with by law enforcement. All rights reserved.

By Nicholas Deshais click to enlarge Billings Gazette Absorbent pads try to contain the oils in the Yellowstone River. At least 42,000 gallons of crude oil spilled into the Yellowstone River near Billings, Mont., two weeks ago after an ExxonMobil pipeline burst. The rupture reportedly has the potential to release 7 million gallons into the river, but the company says the spill was an accident and is contained. Yes, say those who keep a close eye on the Spokane River, including the top water officials at both the city and county of Spokane. Three major pipelines run through the area. The Chevron pipeline carries the same hazardous liquids for a shorter distance north of the city, and the Williams pipeline carries natural gas. Beyond those, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Washington State Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council watch over the siting and abandonment of pipelines, and various other local, state and federal agencies regulate land use, environmental and spill prevention measures.

Komi is one of Russia's largest and oldest oil provinces but ruptures in aging pipelines and leaks from decommissioned oil wells make oil spills in the region routine. Environmentalists estimate at least 1 percent of Russia's annual oil production, or 5 million tons is spilled every year. For decades, Russia has been the pioneer in Arctic development, and it continues to forge ahead. Scientists say sea ice in the Arctic shrank to an all-time low on Sept. 16, at least since satellite records began in 1979. This image shows the amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic on Sept. 16, at center in white, and the 1979 to 2000 average extent for the day shown, with the yellow line. The 2012 record is 49 per cent smaller than the 1979-2000 average. The report describes how oil pollution in Russia's Arctic basin has reached high levels. (Courtesy Elena Wilson Rowe) The government wanted a populated north, and so that was an economic goal. When the Soviet Union began to collapse in 1989, there were nearly 10 million people in the Russian north. The economic chaos and liberalization that followed led to a major migration south. By 2006, one-sixth of the population had left the region. In the hardest-hit regions of Chukotka, nearly 74 per cent of people left, and in Magadan, out-migration was over 57 per cent. Census takers arrived to find ghost towns. This drilling rig at the Val Gamburtseva oil fields in Russia's Arctic region is owned by state oil company Rosneft. On April 4, 2006 a brand-new pipeline threads off over the icy horizon behind the rig. Russia's policy goal is for the Arctic to become its primary resource base by 2020. An elderly Nenets reindeer herder sits on his sled among the buildings of the Val Gamburtseva oil fields in Russia's Arctic region, April 4, 2006. He's from the Komi indigenous group, born in Komi Republic, which is south of the Barents Sea. He grew up in Pechora, a town on the Pechora River, which is the third largest in Europe, measured by discharge. It drains into the Arctic. In the area of Komi where he's from, people rely on hunting and fishing, along with some reindeer herding. Some areas along the Pechora are among the regions of the Russian north that have the highest levels of heavy metal contamination. This oil spill is near Usinsk, Komi Republic, in 2011. One of the worst on record was in the Usinsk in 1994, resulting in a spill of 100,000 to 350,000 tons of oil-containing fluids that badly affected three rivers, including the Pechora, and resulted in a dramatic decrease in fish stock. He said that Komi is famous for its environmental movement, especially attempts to save the Pechora. Four years later he was on staff and since 2000 he has headed their energy program. Greenpeace's Vladimir Chuprov, at a drained thermokarst lake on Yamal peninsula in northern Russia in 2009. A thermokarst lake, also called a thaw lake or cave-in lake, is a body of freshwater, usually shallow, that is formed in a depression by meltwater from thawing permafrost. In August, a conference of Arctic indigenous peoples hosted in Komi called for a moratorium on onshore oil drilling in the Arctic and a ban on all offshore oil drilling on the Arctic shelf. Russia is easily the worst oil polluter in the world. Some Russian government estimates put the amount even higher. In northern Russia, no real rehabilitation takes place in areas with oil spills, the Greenpeace report states. A 2010 report commissioned by the Russian government estimates that 500,000 tons of that spilled oil makes its way into rivers in northern Russia and then ends up in the Arctic Ocean. Next: offshore drilling Russia's plans to drill for oil in the Arctic seas worry Chuprov. Greenpeace activists board Gazprom's Arctic oil platform Prirazlomnaya in the Pechora Sea on Aug. 24. The activists, including Greenpeace International Executive Director Kumi Naidoo, said they were protesting oil drilling in the Arctic. Greenpeace has called on Gazprom to abandon its drilling plans over safety concerns. With production expected to begin later this year at Gazprom's sole Arctic rig, in the Pechora Sea, Greenpeace activists boarded the platform in August. The protest lasted about 15 hours. On Sept. 21, Reuters reported that Gazprom will delay the start of production. Gazprom declined to make an official comment. Production is expected to begin about a year from now. Russian energy companies have signed partnership agreements with Shell, ExxonMobil, Total and Statoil for their Arctic offshore plans. Another method is to burn the spilled oil, but it's difficult to get crude oil to burn in temperatures under zero degrees Centigrade. Pollution from outside Russia a big problem Lars-Otto Reiersen of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program says science and industry have not found an effective method to deal with an oil spill that could result from offshore drilling in the Arctic. Despite all that, Reiersen stresses that Russia itself is not the main source of pollution in the Russian north. It's the wind-borne transport of mercury persistent organic pollutants and industrial chemicals from all over the world, especially Asia. Reiersen explained that these pollutants then accumulate in the food chain and especially the food sources for indigenous people.

They say the route beneath Lake Oahe puts the water source in jeopardy and would destroy sacred land. North Dakota officials estimate more than 176,000 gallons of crude oil leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline into the Ash Coulee Creek. State environmental scientist Bill Suess says a landowner discovered the spill on Dec. 5 near the city of Belfield, which is roughly 150 miles from the epicenter of the Dakota Access pipeline protest camps. The leak was contained within hours of the its discovery, Wendy Owen, a spokeswoman for Casper, Wyoming-based True Cos., which operates the Belle Fourche pipeline, told CNBC. It's not yet clear why electronic monitoring equipment didn't detect the leak, Owen told the Asssociated Press. Owen said the pipeline was shut down immediately after the leak was discovered. United States Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy said the best path forward was to explore alternative routes for the pipeline, something Energy Transfer Partners says it will not do. Energy Transfer Partners says the Dakota Access pipeline would include safeguards such as leak detection equipment and that workers monitoring the pipeline remotely in Texas could close valves within three minutes if a breach is detected. Republican President-elect Donald Trump has voiced support for the Dakota Access Pipeline. About 5,000 people are still occupying land near the planned construction site. The 6-inch steel Belle Fourche pipeline is mostly underground but was built above ground where it crosses Ash Coulee Creek, Suess said. Owen said the pipeline was built in the 1980s and is used to gather oil from nearby oil wells to a collection point. Suess said the spill migrated almost 6 miles from the spill site along Ash Coulee Creek, and it fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. The creek feeds into the Little Missouri River, but Seuss said it appears no oil got that far and that no drinking water sources were threatened. The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over. About 60 workers were on site Monday, and crews have been averaging about 100 yards daily in their cleanup efforts, he said. Some of the oil remains trapped beneath the frozen creek. Suess says about 37,000 gallons of oil have been recovered. The 32,000-gallon spill temporarily shut down water supplies in the downstream community of Glendive, Montana, after oil was detected in the city's water treatment system. True Cos. operates at least three pipeline companies with a combined 1,648 miles of line in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming, according to information the companies submitted to federal regulators. Since 2006, the companies have reported 36 spills totaling 320,000 gallons of petroleum products, most of which was never recovered. Download the latest Flash player and try again.

The company shut down the pipeline and crews have been working to recover oil since Monday, including constructing a dam about 4 miles downstream, according to an incident report. Winter weather was affecting the company's ability to estimate how much oil had been released, said Wendy Owen, spokeswoman for True Companies. The incident was reported by a landowner who saw oil leaking from the 6-inch pipeline into the creek, Suess said. A labor union, which opposed a True Companies pipeline under consideration by the North Dakota Public Service Commission in 2015, issued a statement Tuesday urging regulators to have stronger oversight over the company. The Laborers District Council of Minnesota and North Dakota, which has members working on the Dakota Access Pipeline, said True Companies has a poor track record of spills and environmental incidents. Dakota Access protesters camped in south central North Dakota often cite the company's 30,000-gallon oil spill in the Yellowstone River as an example of why they oppose a pipeline crossing the Missouri River north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. An investigator from the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration is scheduled to arrive on scene Wednesday, the agency said. Inspectors from the state health department have been on site investigating and monitoring the cleanup. Suess said True Companies has a good track record of working with the health department. McFeely: Moorhead mayor should veto city council sham Winter weather was affecting the cleanup, but Suess said crews stayed on site most of Monday night because roads were closed and they couldn't get back to their hotel. The creek flows into the Little Missouri River, but the river is several miles away from the spill site and there was no indication Tuesday the oil had reached that far, Suess said. Many facts were unknown Tuesday, including the age of the pipeline and whether it is a transmission line or a gathering pipeline, which have different levels of regulatory oversight.

By last year, the U.S. had built 12,000 miles of pipe since 2010. On Monday, TransCanada asked the U.S. State Department to suspend review of its controversial Alberta-to-Nebraska pipeline in the latest episode of a six-year drama that has seen as many as five environmental reviews, numerous legal challenges and a rejection in 2012 by President Barack Obama. The 487-mile southern leg of the project, dubbed the Gulf Coast project, between Cushing, Okla. and Texas refineries came on stream in 2014. While the northern leg of Keystone XL remains under review, the Lower 48s have seen new oil pipes crisscrossing the country. The U.S. midstream infrastructure is responding to a near-doubling of U.S. production over the past six years. The U.S. saw an 11.6 per cent increase in crude oil transport via pipelines in 2014, according to AOPL data. But as U.S. oil production eases in response to lower crude prices, the rapid build-up could see pipeline capacity exceed production in the Bakken in North Dakota and even the Permian basin straddling Texas and New Mexico, Ogunnaike estimates. Armed with shipping commitments despite low crude prices, key pipeline operators are proceeding with many projects to alleviate the bottlenecks, which could add as much as 8.7 million barrels per day by 2018, Reuters data shows. TransCanada has reported higher volumes on the Keystone Pipeline System in its third-quarter earnings, while Enbridge Inc. is also looking to expand its presence in the Gulf Coast. Much of the opposition in the U.S. has focused on crude rail terminals, especially in California and Oregon, which has led to delays on some rail projects. In many states, pipeline is viewed more favourably than the sight of crude-bearing rail cars barreling down town centres. But for many the fight against Keystone XL pipeline remains a high priority in a larger battle to combat climate change. All rights reserved.

Residents near the Fukushima coast are being urged to flee to high ground after a 7.3 magnitude earthquake struck the area early on Tuesday. A one-meter tsunami hit the coast at the Fukushima nuclear plant, its operator reported in the hours following the quake. The epicenter of the earthquake was approximately 67 kilometers northeast of Iwaki, according to the US Geological Survey. There have been several aftershocks reported across Japan, felt as far away as Tokyo. The precaution has been taken so engineers can check tracks and make sure that they have not been damaged by the earthquake, Julian Ryall reports. Small local tsunamis can be generated by Seaquakes with a magnitude 6.8 or larger. It was originally reported that a potential tsunami may be up to three meters, but the emergency channel broadcasted shortly after that it could be even higher. At around 6:10 AM local time, a 60 centimeter tsunami reached the Onahama Port in Fukushima. The area was expected to be struck repeatedly. Shortly after the first tsunami struck, NKH reported that the water cooling system seemed to have stopped at TEPCO's Daini nuclear power plant. Tepco issued a statement however, saying that there have been no abnormalities at their power stations. Tsunami waves are expected to hit repeatedly. Monday's earthquake was significantly larger than the 6.6 offshore earthquake that lead to the nuclear disaster in March 2011, when a tsunami struck the Fukushima-1 plant and caused the leakage of radioactive material into the surrounding area. It is widely considered to have been the largest nuclear accident since the Chernobyl catastrophe in 1986. Tohoku Electric has also stated that they have not found any abnormalities at their Onagawa nuclear power plant. Shortly after the earthquake, a fire broke out at a chemical factory in Fukushima prefecture, NHK reported. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe issued a statement saying that he knows about the earthquake and tsunami warning, and ordered the necessary information to be provided to the public.

Oil drilling rigs stretch into the landscape for miles along Highway 67 as it weaves through west Texas' Permian Basin, the landmass that has produced billions of dollars for the oil and gas industry, beginning in the 1920s and continuing with the hydraulic fracturing boom of today. Further west, in Pecos County, a natural gas processing plant can be seen flaring leftover product into the atmosphere. But drive another hour southwest, and evidence of the oil and gas industry's heavy influence on the Texas economy gradually disappears. In less than two hours from the industrial activity, tourists may find themselves in the sleepy, picturesque city of Alpine. On a recent weekday, a buck walks across the street and into someone's yard, forcing the city garbage truck to brake. The town's population of 6,054 makes it the largest in the vicinity of the Big Bend National Park, which is a scenic 100 mile drive to the south. The town also has the region's nearest hospital and nearest state university in relation to the park. Tumbleweeds sometimes blow across the nearby highway roads, like an old Western movie. Twenty miles further west, crossing Brewster County into Presidio County, almost nothing is open in the small town of Marfa, aside from one dive bar, a Dairy Queen, and several expensive hotels. At night, the famous Marfa lights, a phenomenon still unexplained by science, sometimes appear in the sky. Image: M. Aaron Martyn Continue driving southwest, and the long lines of green pipeline are seen crossing through the mountains. The pipe follows along the road another 60 miles before reaching Presidio, a remote border town of 4,079. People who are employed here either work in retail or work for the government in some form, says local insurance salesman and realtor Todd Beckett. Presidio is still famous among some enthusiasts for an alleged UFO sighting over the Chihuahuan desert forty years ago. Otherwise, the town is quiet and surrounded by rugged terrain. With no source of natural gas, homeowners and restaurant owners here rely on propane. People in Alpine, the most upscale and tourist-driven of the three towns, used to have passionate arguments at the local coffee shop about the natural gas pipeline currently under construction in this remote region of Texas. But all of that talk has mostly died down, explains local barista Danielle Arnold. Natural gas pipelines of course criss-cross all over the United States. Gas to Mexico Now, in Alpine, the pipe is already buried under FM 1703, the only road allowing access in or out of the Sunny Glen neighborhood, a residential section of town. Natural gas should begin flowing through the pipe by March of 2017, according to Trans-Pecos Pipeline operator Energy Transfer Partners, the same company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline. The company says its new pipeline will deliver 1.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas from Texas' Pecos County to Mexico, every single day. Coyne Gibson, a volunteer firefighter in Jeff Davis County who worked as an engineer in the oil and gas industry before leaving in disgust in 1982, worries about the fate of the people living in Sunny Glen should that pipeline ever rupture, as natural gas pipelines sometimes do, as seen most recently when a natural gas pipeline exploded outside the Texas panhandle town of Spearman on January 17. One of Energy Transfer's own pipelines burst and caused an explosion in the east Texas town of Cuero in 2015. There were no injuries. Coyne Gibson. Image: Amy Martyn The landscape here in far West Texas is much different. With dry brush and no groundwater, the area is already prone to blazes. Seven volunteer fire departments in the Big Bend region are responsible for 28,000 acres of land, and during fire season, Gibson says, his department may end up fighting three or four a day. The largest grassland fire in Texas' history, in fact, began just two miles west of Marfa in 2011, destroying dozens of homes in the region and killing herds of cattle. Chained themselves to equipment Two hours from here, in Presidio County, a couple from Alpine named Mark and Lori Glover have invited the public and members of the Society of Native Nations, a nonprofit that represents indigenous rights, to camp out on their ranch property as a way to protest the pipeline. Though there are no Indian reservations in Texas, the group has tried to style their protest after the Standing Rock Sioux's NODAPL resistance and spiritual camp. The Glovers and others have also several times this month chained themselves to construction equipment to halt work on the pipeline, resulting in their arrests. Gibson does not join this movement, preferring to try slowing the pipeline down through the courts. The nonprofit he volunteers for, the Big Bend Conservation Alliance, is currently suing the federal regulators who rubber-stamped the project. Though the Glovers' protest camp has attracted some media attention, Gibson has a bleak view of that effort and the group's lockdown protests. Then again, it's not as if there are many other useful options to productively fight the Trans-Pecos Pipeline, as the project is called. When Energy Transfer Partners executives and their contractors suddenly descended on the region to announce their project in the spring of 2015, they were not asking the public for permission to build their pipeline. They were simply telling people that a massive new pipeline would be built, right through some peoples' private property, in fact, and that it was coming soon. Any concerns raised that the project may not benefit any entity other than Energy Transfer Partners would be easily mowed down. Rancher is arrested Suzanne Bailey. Image: YouTube Suzanne Bailey used to live in front of an empty dirt lot near Alpine's Sunny Glen neighborhood. Then, workers suddenly started putting up barbed wire fences on the plot of land directly behind her house. Pumpco Inc., a contractor hired by Energy Transfer Partners, was hauling in equipment to build the Trans-Pecos pipeline before many people even knew what it was. Bailey was immediately concerned about whether the contractor had obtained a permit to use the town's precious water supplies. Heeding her concerns, in May 2015, three members of the Brewster County Groundwater Conservation District walked into the Pumpco yard. Two eventually left. The remaining groundwater district member, a rancher named Tom Beard, stayed. He asked to speak with whoever was in charge, and for that person's name. He never got it. Instead, one of the Pumpco people called the local sheriff. Beard was arrested for criminal trespassing on land now owned by Pumpco, and he got an additional felony charge for allegedly stomping on the deputy's foot during his arrest. (Beard did not return messages). During rainstorms the lot now sometimes floods, causing a stream of mud to fall down the road and into the local community garden, a problem Bailey and Gibson said only appeared since Pumpco began building an equipment yard on the land. Bailey posts footage of the flooding on YouTube and has asked the company to stop violently shaking her house when they work -- she says the vibration from their equipment was once so intense that she worried the house would collapse -- which the company agreed to do, she says. Otherwise, that is all she can do. Park geologist gets warning letter sent to boss Thanks to regulations that Barack Obama enacted in 2012, the federal government has allowed large oil and gas pipeline projects to be approved at a pace that environmental groups recently testified is unlike any they have ever seen. The United States Army Corps of Engineers, for example, began allowing oil and gas pipelines to pass under waterways through a fast-track process called Nationwide Permit 12, which evaluates each water crossing on its own rather than as a whole. In this case, the Trans-Pecos Pipeline makes 135 water crossings, and the Corps looked at each in isolation and determined that the pipeline would have no significant impact. Image: M. Aaron Martyn In May 2015, as word spread about the Trans-Pecos pipeline, one geologist from the national park tried to talk to the Corps about the project and the permitting process. The Corps apparently then passed this request along to Energy Transfer Partners. A letter from the Trans-Pecos Pipeline operators describing their own project was not enough to satisfy Bennett's concerns. He continued asking the Corps of Engineers for the chance to review and comment on permitting documents relating to the pipeline. Then they sent a letter to Bennett's boss. Included in their letter were links to news articles quoting Bennett, and one editorial Bennett had written for the local newspaper in which he detailed a long list of logistical and environmental concerns he had about the project. It will be like a knife wound. Along with Bennett's boss, Trans-Pecos also forwarded their accusations against him to the Corps of Engineers and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the federal agency in charge of giving final approval for the pipeline. Bennett, who still works for the park, declined an interview request. In the end, it's unlikely the result would be any different had the pipeline builders not bothered complaining about him. And we learned about it at the last minute, basically. Novovitch, a former photographer for Reuters now living a quiet life in Alpine, still remembers the meeting when Energy Transfer Partners executive Rick Smith made a presentation for the county, back in April 2015. Novovitch understood little about pipeline regulations at the time or why the project was happening. Though the pipeline is built to deliver natural gas to Mexico, Energy Transfer Partners maintains that most of its project only needs to abide by state regulations, because the pipe goes through only one American state. Never mind that the pipeline is designed to deliver natural gas under the Rio Grande and into Mexico. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the federal agency in charge of natural gas pipelines, has similarly agreed to only require a permit for the 1,093-foot portion of the pipeline that crosses the border. In the state, the pipeline falls under the rule of the Texas Railroad Commission, whose regulators prefer a hands-off approach to oil and gas regulation. FERC ultimately granted its permit in May 2016, a year after construction had begun. Novovitch in the meantime helped lead a successful campaign to require Energy Transfer Partners to install thicker pipe and emergency shut-off valves, though only in the portion of the route that crosses Alpine. The highway from Alpine to Marfa. Image: M. Aaron Martyn A town gets a vague promise James Carpenter, who lives in California's San Fernando Valley, purchased land in Presidio County near Marfa that he hopes to one day use to build an off-the-grid house. He had already sold some land in California to a solar company, and the company expressed further interest in building a farm on his land in Texas, he says. Then he got a letter in the mail from the Trans-Pecos Pipeline, followed by a phone call from their land surveyor. Carpenter began talking with the land man. They wanted a 50-foot easement on his 220 acre property and were willing to pay for it, but Carpenter felt the offer was so low that he needed to get an attorney. The attorney advised him to settle. People who own land or massive ranches in the Big Bend region were among the first to learn the route of the Trans-Pecos Pipeline. In the spring of 2015, landowners started getting letters in the mail, phone calls from surveyors, or in the case of rancher James Spriggs, survey stakes just appearing on his property without warning. The corporation's spokespeople have not returned interview requests from ConsumerAffairs). Eminent domain lawsuits A total of 39 landowners are now facing eminent domain lawsuits from the Trans-Pecos Pipeline, with the landowners arguing (and some lower courts agreeing) that their land is worth more than what Energy Transfer Partners is paying for easements. Energy Transfer Partners' claim that they are a common carrier is another legal gray area. In comes Presidio, the town near the end of the route with no natural gas of its own, which may soon get a supply of it thanks to Energy Transfer Partners, depending on whom you talk to. He describes a regular, six-inch-line that will be built to carry natural gas from the Trans-Pecos project, which is 12 miles outside, to the people of Presidio. Brad Newton. Image: Amy Martyn Only the Trans-Pecos Pipeline has never made any guarantees, at least in writing, that its pipeline will actually bring natural gas to Presidio. No, this is Texas. Part of his belief that natural gas will come here relates to the decision of a chili company to already start building a new plant on the western edge of town. The chili plant, Newton says, will provide 6 full-time jobs and 45 seasonal jobs, and wouldn't come to Presidio without knowing there would be natural gas. The plant is now in charge of negotiating with a local utility to access the gas, and it's unclear whether they will share their wealth. Eventually, he thinks, the natural gas will be transmitted to the residents of Presidio as well, but through a separate agreement. The employees at his new plant, he says, may come from either side of the border. Of course, from the comfort of Alpine or Marfa, which also has natural gas despite being half of Presidio's size, it could be easy to dismiss a poorer town's desire for the same luxury. But Gibson doubts this pipeline project will solve that. The reality is something different than what's been promised. What the future may bring Pretext or not, it was enough to satisfy the regulators in Texas and Washington D.C. Back at the local coffee shop, a married couple who lives in the Big Bend region during winter months has plenty of opinions about the pipeline, none of them good, though they don't want their names attached to what they say. Alpine, Texas sign. Image: M. Aaron Martyn It's easy to forget that a century-long oil boom rules the land only several hours from here, and the pipeline, in critics' eyes, threatens to bring all that closer. He is exaggerating somewhat as he speaks in the past tense. Even with the construction yard and the pipeline work, Alpine still at least gives the appearance of being a clean, quiet, and undisturbed town. The region bears little resemblance to much of Texas. But with a new presidential administration that is even more supportive of fossil fuel extraction than the previous one, how towns like this may look four years from now is anyone's best guess.

Ms. Cavanaugh told host Steve Curwood about her convictions on the need to curb climate-changing gas emissions, protect the land and water from oil spills, and to respect Indigenous rights. The protestors say the project endangers the climate. And members of First Nations are contesting the pipeline in court, because half of it crosses their unceded territory. They say a spill could be disastrous for the local environment that they depend on for traditional foods and medicines. The arrests were mostly peaceful. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is vowing federal cash and more. We are going to get the pipeline built. Her name is Romilly Cavanaugh. CAVANAUGH: Thank you so much it's a pleasure to be with you. CAVANAUGH: Yes that's correct. So I did my degree at University of British Columbia and I've been working for the last thirty years as an environmental engineer. So my primary focus when I worked at the pipeline was to respond to spills, to clean up spills, and also to work on obtaining permits for new construction. So there was some expansion that was done when I was there back in the ninety's, but it was on a much smaller scale than what's planned currently by Kinder Morgan which would take the throughput from three hundred thousand barrels per day to eight hundred ninety thousand. (Photo: Romilly Cavanaugh) CAVANAUGH: Well I had reservations about working there from the beginning because there had already been the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 and I started a couple years after that. So I already had some concerns about the industry in general; but I also had the feeling that if I worked within the environmental department we could at least do the best job possible in terms of environmental protection. So when we would apply for permits through the government we would look for rare and endangered species of animals and plants anywhere in the construction area. We would attempt to have as little disturbance as possible to rivers and creeks from construction; we would deal with issues like noise and dust. So to the best of our ability, minimize the impacts. But ultimately the industry is a dirty industry, we need to phase it out. There was a very funny cartoon that someone showed me when I worked there, and it was a cartoon of a pipeline with a valve, and there was a worker standing there with his hands on the valve. It is by its very nature a polluting industry. So that kind of summed up the entire experience I would say. CURWOOD: Today, you don't work at Trans Mountain. CAVANAUGH: That's correct. Because we're in a climate crisis; now is absolutely the wrong time to be investing in any more fossil fuel infrastructure. We should be moving away from this industry as quickly as possible at this point. So to be increasing the throughput on that pipeline by almost three times is just absolutely the wrong decision. So that's the main issue because it is a global issue, but there's also risks associated with the spill from the tankers. So, the tanker traffic comes from Burnaby, which is a suburb of Vancouver, but then passes basically through the city center of a metropolis with two million people, and then goes out into the Salish Sea where we have the endangered Orca whales. So there's the risks of spills as well that could impact our community as well as the environment. And there's just inadequate equipment available to deal with that, we've seen that with the Gulf of Mexico spill, the Deepwater Horizon, which did close to six billion dollars in damage to the economy there -- tourism, fisheries and other industries -- and widespread damage to the habitat there as well. So if we look back to what happened with the Exxon Valdez, a quarter of a million sea birds died; more than three thousand marine mammals were killed; billions of herring and salmon eggs were smothered. And for twenty years the local people fought to try to get restitution for the impacts to their livelihood. So the oil and gas industry doesn't want us to think about how they impact other industries or other communities; they just want Canadians to focus on job creation within the oil patch. And then there's the whole issue of indigenous rights. So there's just so many issues associated with this project.

(Photo: Rogue Collective, Flickr CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) CURWOOD: The company says that they have robust technology for preventing and cleaning up spills. So in the 1990s, when I was working at the pipeline, if there was a major spill into a marine environment, a successful outcome was for them to be able to contain about ten percent of the oil that was spilled. Very little has changed since then. So they're using pretty much the same technologies, some of the skimming equipment has improved. But they essentially will try to corral the oil using booms at the surface. It's basically almost like a rope for example, with a skirt underneath it, so if the oil doesn't remain at the surface there's no way for them to collect it. A portion of it will always be mixed into the water itself, and with this heavy oil that's coming from Alberta, some of it will sink to the ocean floor. They have no technology whatsoever for anything that doesn't remain on the surface. And then what we saw with the Gulf of Mexico was they tried to boom off the most sensitive habitats like the marshlands, and with wave action and with winds, the oil goes up and over the booms and ends up in those same areas that they're trying to protect. So the equipment is grossly inadequate. CAVANAUGH: The oil sands itself is one of the biggest producers of greenhouse gas emissions in the world. It is a massive industrial site that covers two million acres of forest land. So any additional capacity to have oil transported from Alberta I see as a detriment to climate change. Nearly all of the arrests in protest of the Trans Mountain Expansion Project have been peaceful. Above, one woman who was arrested the same day as Cavanaugh sat on her walker, knitting. (Photo: Rogue Collective, Flickr CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) CURWOOD: Romilly, walk me through what happened to you on the day you were arrested protesting this pipeline. CAVANAUGH: So we started off in a soccer field that was close to the Kinder Morgan facility; we gathered there, we started to do our training, we made a commitment to nonviolence, to no weapons, no drugs, no alcohol. And then we started walking through a trail that went through the forest. The Indigenous leaders were at the front, there was drumming and singing and it was this very beautiful and peaceful moment as we walked there. We could hear the birds singing; people commented that there was a combination of sounds -- the sounds of nature and the sounds of construction, because they were taking the trees down at that point -- and as we walked the drumbeat, I've been told, is meant to slow down your heart rate and your heart will be in unison with that beat. So there's a very peaceful feeling that comes over you. As I started walking I thought I don't know if I can do this or not. And then as I walked it became very clear I have to do this. And so at that point if I had any doubt about getting arrested, if it was really the right thing to do, all the fears about that went away. So the first group went up to the gate and they used the zip ties to attach themselves to the gate. And then once the police arrived they read out the court injunction, letting people know exactly what it said, and gave them ten minutes to decide if they wanted to remain. CURWOOD: So at this point you're one of those people who hasn't tied herself to the gate, but you're just standing there. CAVANAUGH: That's right. So we went up in groups; there were six people to start with. They were arrested, and when that happened a line of police stood in front of the gate so that we couldn't get through. So we sat in a row in front of them and one by one they came and arrested each person. CAVANAUGH: They took us to a temporary processing area. So they had tables and chairs set up on a trail beside the property. Which I thought was really wonderful, because not all of the police there are in support of this project, but they are doing their job and they're required to be there. So I thought that was an interesting moment. CAVANAUGH: Well the reason that I decided to get arrested is because I've seen over and over again that our government is making the wrong choices for the planet and for the people. And when I was younger I really trusted them, naively. In fact when I worked at the pipeline company I'd started to hear about climate change; it wasn't very well known at that time, certainly amongst people in the public. And I really felt the government will take care of it. And then decades went by where nothing was happening, and it became more and more clear, it's been thirty years now since the United Nations set up the International Panel on Climate Change. There's thirty years of very hard scientific data backed up by the vast majority of climate scientists around the world. There's consensus on this issue. But the industry did a really good job of muddying the waters, delaying action. They used the same tactics that the tobacco industry used to try to delay action related to cancer being caused by smoking. If we want change we have to stand up. In a peaceful way, and with knowledge and with commitment. And what's beautiful about this movement is it's bringing people together from lots of other movements as well. There was a representative there from Black Lives Matter. There's people there who are transgendered. There's people there in wheelchairs and with walker; of all races and of all ages; there's youth and there are seniors. So yeah I just realized at that point that it's naive to sit around waiting for the government to do the right thing. If we want the right thing to happen we need to make it happen. CURWOOD: Back at the Paris climate meeting, I saw Prime Minister Justin Trudeau enthusiastically embracing the process and the Accord and committed to curbing Canada's greenhouse gas emissions. CAVANAUGH: Well it just doesn't ring true at all. We are very disappointed in Canada, with what has proceeded since that time. So in the past we had Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who was from Alberta. He was very pro oil and gas; we had no expectation that he would take any action on climate change. But then when Trudeau was elected, the people who are concerned about these issues had a sigh of relief and thought, OK now we're on the right track. So he said many beautiful things in Paris, but you can't have that and continue to expand the oil sands, it doesn't make any sense. We have one of the highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions in the world because of the oil sands, because it's such a huge emitter. And I'm not anti-industry and I'm certainly not anti-jobs; and what I believe is those people as well don't really have a future. This is a dying industry, whether it dies in the next five, ten or twenty years, or if we burn every last drop of oil on this planet and really destroy the climate, it will end. It's not a renewable resource. CURWOOD: Well Romilly, large multinational corporations can be pretty tough to deal with; you and your fellow protesters are up against the company and the approval of the Prime Minister. Romilly Cavanaugh is a former Trans Mountain employee who is protesting the Trans Mountain Expansion Project. (Photo: Rogue Collective, Flickr CC BY-NC-SA 2.0) CAVANAUGH: Well that's a really good question; it does seem very much like a David and Goliath kind of struggle. But I am very hopeful, because we've seen other projects in Canada cancelled, like the Northern Gateway project which would have gone through northern B.C. And would have had a similar impact as what we're seeing now with the Kindred Morgan project. So there's several court cases that are still pending; the Indigenous communities in B.C. Have unceded territory, which means that their territory was never signed over to the English government when the colonialists came here. So the pipeline would be going across unceded territory. But the group that's leading this protest is the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, which is just across the water from where the tanker loading facility would be. And they rely on the fish and the shellfish and a clean environment for their survival, so they're very concerned about protecting the land and the water, which to them is not just a source of sustenance, but it's sacred. So they have a right to protect their land and their water. And the provincial government has also started a court case against the federal government to say that they're concerned about what will happen with the heavy oil if there is a marine spill. There's been inadequate science, inadequate amount of research to determine what the fate would be of that oil. So there are multiple things that could happen to shut this project down; another one is that the investors could just throw their hands up in the air and decide it's not worth it because I don't think they realize just how dedicated the protesters are. So we've had protests here in B.C. But we've also had them all across Canada. And it seems very much like a movement, it seems to be building momentum. So it could go either way but I'm hopeful that that we will be successful with our protests. CURWOOD: Romilly Cavanaugh is an environmental engineer and now an activist based in Vancouver, Canada.

A loss in the high court would clear Enbridge to not only reverse the flow of oil in the 40-year-old line, sending it from west to east, but also to raise its capacity to 300,000 barrels a day from 240,000. The high court heard the case November 30 and is expected to issue its decision Wednesday morning. Built in the mid-1970s, Line 9 first carried oil west to east but its flow was reversed in 1998, allowing cheaper foreign crude to be sent to the Sarnia area for refining and its petro-chemical industries. Five years ago, as higher oil prices made North American production more attractive, including from unconventional sources such as the oilsands, Enbridge applied to reverse and expand the line. One portion of the line, 9A from Sarnia to North Westover near Hamilton, is already reversed. Line 9 runs through the London region and crosses the Thames River in Middlesex Centre, a spot about 35 kilometres away from the reserve but through Chippewas treaty territory. Dozens of environmental groups and First Nation communities along Line 9 argued against the project during NEB hearings. Critics have held demonstrations, sit-ins and protests. Henry, who was elected chief on Saturday, defeating incumbent Leslee White-Eye and two other candidates, said the community hopes for the best but is braced for whatever the court rules.

Share your experiences of the NHS this winter Read more Unprecedented numbers of patients requiring care has led to at least 23 hospital trusts declaring they cannot cope since Monday, inquiries by the Guardian have established. Struggling hospitals have been forced to take highly unusual steps in order to manage a surge in demand for care. Hospitals are expected to come under even greater strain over the next few days as unusually cold weather sweeps across much of the country, which doctors fear could prompt a spike in serious breathing problems, among other conditions. At one point that day it had 27 patients who needed a bed but nowhere to put them. The hospital had nowhere to put the next patient brought in as an emergency by ambulance, it added. The Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, warned that the already chaotic situation in the NHS could get even worse as the winter weather worsens and that the A&E system is at risk of breaking. He urged ministers and NHS leaders to draw up an urgent action plan to rescue A&E care to avoid the quality of care patients receive starting to deteriorate. However, it is understood that reports of a package of emergency funding for A&E units are wide of the mark and that the Department of Health will not be producing any more money, despite mounting problems. On Tuesday the Royal United hospital in Bath closed its Paulton Birth Centre for two weeks, which is usually used by women having a low-risk pregnancy who want a natural birth, and began using it to house medical patients instead. Mothers-to-be left disappointed by the temporary closure could have their babies at an unspecified location elsewhere, it added. Its main problem was its inability to discharge older patients, in order to free up beds, because local social care was inadequate, the trust added. It had also put more staff on to its frontline and cancelled elective surgery to help it cope. A doctor at the Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS trust said it had decided not to declare an internal emergency because its bosses did not want bad publicity.

Bitumen is a mixture of hydrocarbons left over after oil is distilled. Traditionally, this material is used to create hard surfaces like road blacktops. However, in the process they actually degraded it, creating a thick, gummy mixture. By doing this, petroleum could be captured as the mixture hardens. Gates and his team were able to form pebbles of oil that would harden by themselves.

I caught up with John shortly after his release from jail to find out more about the protest and what he thought it means for fracking in Pennsylvania. The full 30 minute interview with John Nicholson is also available on the Public Herald SoundCloud account. To republish from newsCOUP please review the Permission page. Oh, it was a great view. Luckily the Panthers won, I was happy about that. As they stand now, those files are incredibly inaccessible to the general public. John Nicholson scanning complaint records and fracking permits at the Department of Environmental Protection with Public Herald. Oh, absolutely. So, everything from that side, the personal relationship side with the state, as well as how permits are issued, what are inside those permits, what is addressed, and what is overlooked. The banner drop that we did on Monday is related to a liquid natural gas (LNG) export facility that is currently under construction in southern Maryland, in Lusby. The facility lies in Calvert County, and in the most populated area of the county. I was at the game and I was on the rappel line for over 45 minutes before I lowered myself down and was then abrubtly and swiftly detained by both private security ushers and Mecklenburg County Charlotte police. As I stated before this is a huge project. To switch it from import to export is unprecedented and takes an enormous amount of infrastructure. And Bank of America is the largest recorded backer of this project. The project itself is completely over budget, and not on time. Dominion has a very checkered track-record in the way of safety and as well as emissions. And so, this was at the Cove Point facility and that was before construction started. That was emissions of ammonia before it had started to become an export facility. Bank of America knows all this. How they operate is they do all kind of financial risk assessments before ever even thinking about putting money and investment into a project this large. We know from the air emissions alone that if this facility is completed and is operating at best conditions that there will be a spike in childhood leukemia, asthma, and birth defects. If the facility is completed and again operating under best conditions it would emit annually 22.5 tons of toxins into the air. I think the media response has been great and a lot people have been checking out the website and wanting to know more about the issue. With this permit, or with any other permit under FERC. Thousands of lives literally will be in the balance if this facility is completed. To give you some numbers on the risks, the Department of Energy usually recommends for a LNG facility to have a 2.2 mile evacuation zone, and 2.2 miles from Cove Point would include 8,000 people. And, there has been resistance the entire time that this permit has gone through the FERC process and under construction. There have been protests at public meetings, there have been people that have locked themselves down to construction equipment, even a crane at one time. There have been all sorts of marches through the county and through the town of Lusby. I felt like this action was need to further visibility. I feel like members of the Lusby community and people in southern Maryland and around the country who have been concerned about this have been talking about it for a very long time, and nothing has come of it. And I felt like an escalation in the tactics were necessary. Escalating how we get messages to people utilizing the internet was really needed in this case. For me, getting that message out really outweighed any personal discomfort or financial loss for participating in something like this and then being arrested. I think for a lot of reasons, categorizing fracking as a done deal within the state boundaries of Pennsylvania is really false. The type of mentality that is continually pushed through PR and all the different arms of these companies to small communities is very calculated. I see this over and over again, and I see so many correlations with how Dominion interacts with the residents of Lusby. I think these companies are very calculated in where they choose to do and to not do business. WeAreCovePoint obtained documents that clearly state multiple individuals from the Calvert County police department are on special payroll with Dominion Energy. I have witnessed this. I went to visit someone for interviews in Calvert County and was pulled over and the officer who pulled me over had a lanyard that said his name and Dominion Energy on it. I think the most important thing to take away is that if this facility is built there will almost positively be more fracking in Pennsylvania. Being from Pennsylvania and understanding the dynamics of fracking and all that comes with that I feel very strongly in opposition to this export facility being built. And inevitably that will happen more at a faster rate if this export facility is built. As soon as first responders started to touch that system and try to literally pull me back up is when I was most unsafe. And that, if landowners want to see any money from their lease they would need to get behind the export facilities and pipeline production on deck for places like Cove Point and the commonwealth. My charges are all misdemeanors. The first one is trespass in the second degree; failure to obey a public officer or law enforcement, also misdemeanor; the third charge is dropping or throwing an object at a sporting event which I think is specifically a North Carolina law; and the last one they tacked on before I left the jail is labelled as a city violation but in the description it specifically speaks to me rappelling and displaying a banner. I think the easiest and most important is for people to educate themselves. The lack of education highlights a huge problem in our country where large corporations are operating without the control or even check-in with the people. webpage. On there is a history of the project. If people want to go further than that they can always donate to the cause. Third, and lastly, I think people can plugin, contact us. This is egregious. You want to come into a community and put that entire community at risk for an indefinite amount of time is unacceptable. If you wish to donate part of your footage or business space to a newsCOUP installation please contact us with your information. It gives me an opportunity to briefly explain the often overlooked way that the business of supplying power to people is interwoven in complex ways. The project was begun in the 1960s and is still only half finished. As it stands, it reliably provides my current home state with about 14 billion kilowatt hours of electricity each year without producing any greenhouse gases or other types of air pollution. Those additional kilowatt hours are produced by a combination of plants that burn coal or natural gas and produce substantial quantities of greenhouse gases, fly ash, SOx, NOx, and mercury. The company began efforts to complete the facility about ten years ago, but it has been a slow process. Part of the slowdown has been due to organized resistance from people who claim to be afraid of the new unit even though the existing facility has an admirable record of being a good (locally popular) neighbor, paying good salaries, providing reliable power, participating in the local community, paying large tax bills, keeping both workers and the public safe and healthy and even providing a warm place to water ski in the cooler months of the year. I suspect that at least some of the resistance is also coming from the people involved in the business of supplying the coal and natural gas to the plants that would be made redundant if the clean energy facility is completed. There are big numbers involved; the amount of fuel burned in the plants that could be displaced produces several hundreds of millions of dollars per year in revenue. The permitting and construction process for the expansion of the existing clean energy facility has also been slowed because Dominion accountants, planners and decision makers convinced themselves that their stockholders would see more immediate profit from fracking, building pipelines, and converting the Cove Point facility into an export terminal than completing a facility that would supply a couple million of my fellow Virginians with 60-80 years worth of clean electricity. The financials associated with the projects needed to make that export facility work look good because it enables irreplaceable American natural gas to be sold at higher prices under 20-year contracts with European customers than can be obtained in our temporarily oversupplied market at home. There is no an infinite supply of capital or human resources; companies have to make choices about how to best deploy their limited assets. It is also difficult to capture attention and find fellow activists who want to help push a company towards building a needed facility instead of organizing them to stop building something. I hope this comment is a step towards making contact with passionate people like you and John to explain how we can help each other and make the world a cleaner, safer, and more equally prosperous place.

Having contributed to over 100 documents associated with NEPA reviews, I can honestly say that the process is not cheap. Using the notorious NWP 12 permitting process is another way out. Double, Double Oil in Trouble Double, double toil and trouble; Fire Burn, and caldron bubble. After reaching a peak of over 1 million barrels in December 2014, production in the Bakken oil field has been in decline. The downward spiral is not just limited to the Bakken. The Bakken Peak has sounded an alarm throughout the local oil and gas industry, which can be heard from construction workers to executives to everyone in between. For instance, the three largest Bakken drillers have experienced a precipitous collapse in revenue of 70 percent since 2014. And this is a big problem for ETP, one that may lead to a Showcase Showdown with its backers. Moreover, while prices have slightly rebounded in recent months, analysts are skeptical that the recovery can be sustained. Even if it was operational by January 1, 2017, which is now impossible due to the Army Corps decision, the price of oil still would not be at 2014 levels. ETP knows this better than anyone, which may help explain why the company sold almost half of its stake in DAPL this past August to a joint venture involving Enbridge Energy Partners and Marathon Petroleum. But any relief from that move will not be realized until the Army Corps grants final approval. Stopping work at this time is near impossible without causing significant and extreme harm. It would be an infeasible task without grave and irreparable impacts to DAPL, its workers, the landowners, economy, both the state and federal government, and the environment. This may be the first and only time I say this in my life, but I think we need to take the oil corporation at its word. These developments are the equivalent of lighting money on fire. A Market-Based Solution We Can Get Behind The valiant and peaceful Native-led resistance to DAPL is in large part responsible for the Army Corps decision, which represents a major blow to the Black Snake. But as surreptitious as the oil and gas industry can be, they are never coy about their stated resolution to make as much money as possible for themselves and their stockholders, and 2017 will be no different. There is existing capacity in the region to move about 2.5 million gallons per day, meaning that DAPL is unnecessary. DAPL has taught us many lessons, and one of the most consequential may be reserved for oil investors: going in on fossil fuels is like putting money on the Cleveland Browns. If you listen closely, you will hear the silent screams of the Black Snake bleeding out. He has presented the case for climate justice, environmental justice, and climate change action at universities nation- and worldwide and written on the subjects for various publications.

Their voices are critical not only for the wisdom, solutions and pointed analysis that they offer, but also because of the direct, violent impacts of the fossil fuel industry that are often borne disproportionately on the bodies of Indigenous women. With conviction and care, the women convey that protecting water and sacred places has always been their traditional role as women, and they are taking a fierce stand to ensure a healthy life for generations to come. They speak of the need for ceaseless action for Indigenous sovereignty; for a new relationships between Native communities, governments and corporations; and for a paradigm of socio-ecological balance based on respect for women and the Earth. Women on the frontline also decry the rapidly escalating militarization and abuses of local law enforcement, which has included the use of attack dogs, mace, intrusive surveillance and physical violence against those involved in ongoing non-violent direct actions based in traditional prayer and ceremony. Since the collection of these statements, mass arrests, check-points , violence and intimidation against land and water defenders has grown more dire. Leaders from diverse national and international institutions point to a long legacy of colonial injustices against Native peoples in the U.S., ongoing through environmental racism, human and Indigenous rights abuses and damage to the Earth by corporate and state actors who continue to push forward pipeline construction. The words and determination of these women stand strong as beacons of hope, resistance and love that shine far beyond the corporate pillage of Energy Transfer partners and the banks and corporations financing the pipeline. The insights of these dedicated Indigenous women leaders call out to a world facing climate disaster and massive degradation of the Earth's ecological systems. We have been here since then, standing up in prayer, doing our best to stop a pipeline that will damage our water. First and foremost we are water protectors, we are women who stand because the water is female, and so we must stand with the water. If we are to live as a people, we must have water, without water we die. So everything we do as we stand here, we must make sure that we do it in prayer, and that we do it in civil-disobedience. We do it with goodness and kindness in our hearts, but we stand up. We will not let them pass. We stand. Because we must protect our children and our grandchildren. If you respect women, you respect Earth and you respect water ... It's so simple, this whole fight, it has nothing to do with being an activist, but it has everything to do with being a mom. As a mom, it's really hard to lose a child, you are never the same, and so when my son died, I buried him on that hill over there, so that he would be right there to watch the mouth of the Cannon Ball and the Missouri Rivers. And when they told me they were going to build a pipeline I was like, 'I can't allow that, I can't allow anybody to put a pipeline next to my sons graves'. I knew that this was the place I was meant to be, the place where I would benefit my people most ... I felt the call, and I've just been active in this fight ever since, because I feel the pain of what the government is doing to our Mother Earth. They are raping her, across the world they are cutting up her belly and bringing out all her guts and it's just not right. We as woman we can feel her pain, we have that connection to her. We can hear her screams even though she doesn't have a voice, we see it. There used to be so many snows here, there used to be so many animals, and they are gone. It's only going to take two hours for the oil to reach my community and reach my people. There will be no warning for us, they aren't going to tell us if the pipeline breaks, they are going to try to cover it up. Our water would be contaminated ... that's environmental racism. It is. On my people. This is our future ... I am here for my children that have not yet come. I want to tell them someday, hey, I loved you so much that I gave my life for you, I gave my life to defend your land and your water. Everything man made breaks, including our laws and our government, and it is up to us, as citizens of the United States, as citizens of this great country, we have to hold them accountable. And that is what we are doing here. Champa Seyboye Champa Seyboye (Spirit Lake Sioux living in Mandan, North Dakota)Osprey Orielle Lake I am here at the Oceti Sakowin camp to support clean water, to support Mother Earth. There are so many bodies of water around the world that we can no longer drink from, and the Missouri River provides water to so many of us. If it gets contaminated a lot of people will be affected. This is a pipeline that is over 11,000 miles in length, and which is endangering everyone all along the water corridor down to the Gulf of Mexico and out to the world. Immediately in this location we have millions of people that will be impacted directly, so this is not just about the few of us holding it down here in Cannonball, North Dakota - this is about all of us who live downstream. This is about protecting our water sources - it is not just about one pipeline. The big picture is that the fossil fuel industry is on its way out. This country mostly, and our choices as human being around the world, are causing climate chaos, and that is why we see rising ocean levels and Pacific Island states disappearing and people being displaced from their homes. That is equivalent to 21.4 million new vehicles per year. If this country of the U.S.A. was really serious about reducing emissions, we would absolutely not allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to be built. I was given those names by my people because it's been my life struggle to protect the water. I grew up on this river, I was removed and displaced when I was 10 years old, and I have never been compensated for the home that my grandparents lost. ... We have been on a campaign for life, and it is our life struggle to maintain this river where we have lived all of our lives, under international principles of treaty that govern our relationship with the United States. We want no pipeline. We want no oil going through our river, through our land. The sun is our natural world, and we need to utilize the solar and the natural energies that probably will devastate the capitalist world, but that's how it has to be. We're at a new threshold of human rights. It's not about just us. It's about the whole world. It's about Mother Earth, having endured her suffering for this long, she needs our help. She needs our protection. She's a female, and Indigenous people are the keepers of Mother Earth. We're obligated to keep her water for her, and maintain the life as created, and for us. We are invoking all of our rights to the water, to the treaty crossing, and we need allies to help us continue ... We are here for the long haul. We are here. We're staying here until there is no pipeline. I'm here to protect these people all around us, this land, this is sacred land, there are burial sites all through here ... This is a youth led movement, people forget that, that the youth are here fighting. Come to Standing Rock. ... You will be taken care of, that is the way of our people. We are bringing our prayers, we are bringing our Chanupas, we are bringing our tobacco. We are stopping this black snake that would kill us. This pipeline here would kill us, it would give us cancers, it would give our kids cancers. There's gonna be no future generations if this pipeline is built. Go look out at the soil by the pipeline. They are not here for themselves or us, they are here for the money. Pipeline workers, police, if you hear this, you need to understand how you are hurting us, how you are hurting the children.

It is a beautiful thing to be here and see all the Nations reunited, together as it should be. And she said that the women were going to be in front of this fight, women were going to be standing in the front in red shawls ... and you see that happening here ... we have to be ready to fight them, and we have to to take everything that we learned and teach elsewhere. That's a paradigm that has no place in today's world and so that's why I'm here. We are fighting the Dakota pipeline, but we're also fighting the whole system of violence. The whole system which has called us savages. That respects its women. That gives its children priority. That will teach its children the traditional knowledge of life, that will give them life ... When I saw the young women crying out for help, I said I have to be there because I'm not going to watch these people be desolated for the greed of a corporation that does not love this land, that is not part of this land. That's the beautiful work that we're here for. ... When we have natural resource development which is unsustainable, which threatens the very life of human beings and the natural world, we say absolutely no, it's unacceptable. We deserve better than that. We're not going to let the future of America, the future of Turtle Island to be robbed and taken and stolen from us. I came here to stand with my Indigenous relatives for something that is much larger than just a single project. We want to stop this project but we also want to take a stand and say, 'no more'. Enough is enough. Indigenous people have been targeted for far too long and we've had to give up everything. And so I am hopeful that when we stop this project, it will be a moment in which people will realize that Indigenous nations are here, and we are sovereign, and we are not going to tolerate the conversation as it is today. It's always so important for me to be here, to be there for the people, the people we must feed to stay strong, so they can stay here and do the work they are doing for us all.

The atrociousness regarding what happened with the burial sites being dug up by machinery, it's unfortunately not an uncommon occurrence for us, for Native peoples. As women, we are life givers, we are nurtures within our communities, and have such a strong connection to Mother Earth as well. Violence against Mother Earth is violence against our women. And, that is part of what we stand for. We are here to provide our support and to stand together as women in the movement, and with all of our relatives here. We carry that water inside of us. And this is about this to, this is about connection. ... We have to listen to our core, our core responsibilities as humankind, let us honor ourselves, let us honor each other, let us take care of ourselves as we take care of the world around us. ... There is a prayer that has been laid down here and it's not just for our generation, is for the next generations, and so we carry that, we carry that forward for healing and wellness for the Earth.

And here's the first place you'll see the 2020-2025 DGAs break from tradition: rather than identifying topics of interest after the committee is selected, USDA and HHS have developed a list of topics first, soliciting public comments in the process. In an effort to avoid duplication with other Federal efforts, it is expected that these topics will be reflected in the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines by referencing the existing guidance. And the tentative timeline that the agencies have proposed is ambitious. After the committee is announced in early 2019, it will have just over one year to deliberate before releasing its scientific report. all appearances, the key concern seemed to be that science-based sustainability recommendations were outside the scope of the DGAs. though efforts to communicate the science behind more sustainable, plant-based diets have been all but stymied, there is still plenty at stake for industry groups in the 2020-2025 DGA cycle.

The potential for a pipeline leak that might taint drinking water is at the core of the months-long standoff at the Dakota Access pipeline, where thousands of people have been protesting against its construction. That pipeline would cross the Missouri river. A landowner discovered the spill near Belfield on 5 December, according to Bill Suess, an environmental scientist with the North Dakota health department. Suess said the spill migrated about six miles from the spill site along Ash Coulee creek, and it fouled an unknown amount of private and US Forest Service land along the waterway. The creek feeds into the Little Missouri river, but Seuss said it appears no oil got that far and that no drinking water sources were threatened. He said about 37,000 gallons of oil had been recovered as of Monday. Owen said the pipeline was shut down immediately after the leak was discovered. True Cos has a history of oil field-related spills in North Dakota and Montana, including a January 2015 pipeline break into the Yellowstone River. The six-inch steel Belle Fourche pipeline is mostly underground but was built above ground where it crosses Ash Coulee creek, Suess said. Owen said the pipeline was built in the 1980s and is used to gather oil from nearby oil wells to a collection point. About 60 workers were on site Monday, and crews have been averaging about 100 yards daily in their cleanup efforts, he said. Some of the oil remains trapped beneath the frozen creek.

Suess said he expected to have more information later today about the volume of spilled oil and the cause. He said the break occurred where a section of the pipe is exposed over a narrow ravine in the creek, a short stretch extruding from one hillside before entering the other and considered to be self-supporting. He said it appears a slough, or small slide in the soil could be the cause and a geotechnical expert will be involved in the investigation. The 6-inch pipeline has been shut down. The EPA is involved because Ash Coulee Creek empties into the Little Missouri River, waters under federal jurisdiction. The spill appears to be contained to a 2.5-mile stretch of Ash Coulee Creek, about 20 miles upstream from where it reaches the Little Missouri River, Suess said. The creek was still flowing at the time the spill was detected, but froze Tuesday, with good and bad outcomes. The freeze prevents more migration of oil, but also makes it more difficult to pump oil, he said. The spill location is about 16 miles northwest of Belfield. Your notification has been saved.

By Jonathan Thompson Miles of unused pipe prepared for the proposed Keystone XL pipeline sit in a lot in October 2014 outside Gascoyne, North Dakota. As the weather gets colder, the fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline is heating up, in rather ugly ways. One protester may lose her arm as a result of injuries suffered during the violence. Construction on the pipeline is about 85 percent complete and it has, indeed, put people to work. Yet it is not clear how many new jobs have been created since the jobs are spread out over 1,000 miles. That, in turn, generates sales and lodging tax revenues for the local governments. In a few months, when (and if) construction is complete, the workers and their spending money will depart. The finished pipeline will require just 40 permanent maintenance and operational jobs along its entire stretch. That said, it might be enough to buy the county sheriffs some more military gear from the Pentagon in order to squelch the next pipeline protest. They otherwise go mostly unnoticed until they spill, burst, or explode. The bigger-picture impact, whether on climate change or energy independence, is more difficult to suss out. That is, if you expand pipeline capacity for North Dakota crude, it will encourage more oil drilling and thus more oil production. If more domestic oil is produced, the logic goes, then we have less need to import foreign oil and we achieve greater energy independence. The flip side to that is the more oil we drill, the more we consume, resulting in greater carbon emissions. We can move crude oil not only through pipelines but also with trucks, trains, and tankers. The lack of pipeline capacity is not a major limiting factor in oil development and production; when the North Dakota boom was on, no one opted out of drilling because of a lack of transportation options. In fact, prices were so high, no one opted out of drilling at all. Just as the biggest driver of oil development is a high oil price, the biggest hindrance, particularly for expensive-to-drill North Dakota crude, is a low oil price. That relationship has been on display in North Dakota, and across the West, for the last decade: Oil prices went up, thanks to burgeoning demand in China and the developing world, so drilling intensified and production went bananas. Wells that produced 220 barrels per day when they were drilled in 2005, for example, now only produce about 20 barrels per day. No longer does more pipeline capacity directly lead to more production; it must first either raise the price of oil, or induce demand. A pipeline across the upper Midwest will not inspire the masses in China to buy cars and drive them all over the country. It will not affect global demand. The Dakota Access Pipeline is expected to carry a half-million barrels of oil per day to refineries and market hubs in Illinois. After the last bust, producers and their investors are unlikely to fork out that kind of cash until oil prices go up considerably and stay there, which will only happen if Saudi Arabia commits to a long-term slash in its production. Unless new wells are drilled in North Dakota at a furious rate, production will continue to decrease, thanks to the decline curve. There is one other way the pipeline could impact oil prices, at least for the oil flowing through the line. Some oil customers reportedly entered into contracts with producers prior to construction to buy DAPL oil at or near 2014 prices. If those contracts remain in place despite the protests-caused construction delay, it could, theoretically, push producers to drill a few more wells to produce enough oil to fetch the higher price. But probably not. The glut grows. Prices slide further downward. Production slides. The cycle continues. Therefore, it will not directly lead to a significant increase in carbon emissions. Nor will it get the U.S. any closer to energy independence. The equation that answers that one is far simpler. Yes, Trump is invested in the companies behind the pipeline, though the amount of his stake decreased substantially between 2015 and 2016.

Yet all the most-hyped 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are on board with the idea, including the Medicare expansion's biggest champion, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The idea in concept is simple: Allow states to open up their Medicaid programs to anyone regardless of income. Those people could buy in to the social safety net and have access to Medicaid's provider network and benefits. The groundwork for expanding the program for low-income Americans has already been laid to some extent as 34 states have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. and Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.). But the real efforts are happening at the state level where legislatures all over the country are seriously considering the idea. Heather Howard, a lecturer at Princeton University who also helps states with their health-care systems, said many plans are in their infancy, but that 14 states across the country have made moves to, at minimum, weigh the benefits and challenges of shifting Medicaid to a publicly available health insurance option. That's because Medicare is operated at the federal level so any major changes to it have to be decided in Washington. Medicaid, on the other hand, is run by the states, so they have more discretion over how the program is set up. There are real critiques of Medicaid as it now exists, such as low reimbursement rates for doctors and uniform access to care. To offer it to everyone would require responding to those criticisms as well as new questions such as the cost to states, whether states have to apply for federal waivers to alter the program and whether a public option lives on or off the ACA exchanges. This week stakeholders across New Mexico met with President Obama's former Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Andy Slavitt to begin some of those conversations. Earlier this year, New Mexico's state legislature passed a bill to create a committee to study a Medicaid buy-in program. Medicaid is popular there; one-third of New Mexicans are enrolled. Yet 230,000 people remain uninsured in the state, according to Kaiser Family Foundation data, and proposed premium rates for 2019 for those who don't qualify for ACA subsidies are increasing anywhere from 9.2 percent to 18.5 percent. Slavitt is the board chair of a new group, United States of Care, which has an impressive roster of bold-faced names leading it from investor Mark Cuban to former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau to former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her astronaut husband Mark Kelly. In the absence of Washington leadership, the group is working with states on ways to improve health care. But even if Democrats win the House majority and make gains in the Senate, President Trump has said Obamacare is unsustainable and his administration has worked persistently to chip away at it. It's the type of proposal, he reasons, that could peel off moderate Republicans in a way that a national Medicare program never could. It's true that Medicaid is a favorite GOP punching bag. The Trump administration is urging states to add work requirements to their programs and the GOP playbook has long included capping how much the federal government pays each state to administer Medicaid. Yet 34 states, including many with Republican governors, expanded the ACA under Medicaid to include more low-income residents, and several more red states are on the precipice of following them. It's a program that has endured and grown for 53 years. Sparer has written extensively on the topic and told me his support for expanding Medicaid is heavily influenced by the political viability of focusing on the program for low-income Americans versus the one covering seniors -- meaning states don't have to wait for a new president to do something meaningful.

The agency is warning that beef, pork and poultry in certain salads may be tainted with intestinal parasites, our Post colleague Alex Horton reports. Just this week so far he's made six. These stats come courtesy of the Post fact checker team's interactive daily tracker of claims made by the president. As of Wednesday, after 558 days in office, Trump had said 4,229 untrue things, which amounts to approximately 7.6 a day. Most of Trump's health-care falsehoods this week were made at a Tuesday night campaign rally in Tampa. On average, the study found veterans using the choice program wait 64 days. FACT: Trump suggests that Sen. John McCain's vote was the only impediment to passing a repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act. FACT: Credible estimates suggest the health-care law boosted the number of people with health insurance by 20 million. The Congressional Budget Office said that the individual market would be stable in most markets at least for the next ten years under the Affordable Care Act, though the Trump administration has taken steps to weaken it that have raised premiums. FACT: This is wrong. Eliminating the individual mandate may weaken the Affordable Care Act, as it may lead to risk pools that are less healthy, but it does not wipe out the law. FACT: Trump is wrong. The new association plans have not be sold yet. Most health-care experts say they will offer substandard insurance. All the premium requests will need to be approved by state regulators, but it's an early peek at anticipated rates. Digging into the numbers, the Wall Street Journal found that many premium increases were less than previous years and some were even reduced. The CMS data is public and searchable so any consumer can look at their plan's rate proposals. The District of Columbia voted to implement its own mandate after Congress eliminated the ACA requirement that everyone have health insurance or pay a penalty. GOP senators tried to add the language to a government funding bill, but a slim majority voted to table it, The Hill reports. countered that allowing the amendment to proceed would be saying to D.C. that the federal government would tell them what to do. However the debate's not over. The House GOP did add such language to the funding bill it passed, so there will be a renewed opportunity for Republicans to try to get the language into a final appropriations package when the two chambers negotiate their competing versions.

But shares of eHealth and Health Insurance Innovations, two companies that sell short-term plans, rose in response to the news, CNBC reported. It's been well-established that these plans aren't bound by ACA's required benefits or its protections for people with preexisting conditions. But Sanger-Katz also writes that a short-term plan can cap how much it will pay for your care, so if you're stricken with an expensive illness and go over that amount, you could be without coverage. She also pointed out some stranger exclusions, such as a plan in Illinois that only covers hospital stays that begin during the week.

Twelve of the 13 oil producers - including BP Canada, Teck Energy Sales, Andeavor and Canadian Natural Resources - did not respond to Reuters inquiries or declined to comment on their contracts with Kinder Morgan. In response, federal and Alberta officials scrambled to rescue the project, promising to indemnify Kinder Morgan against further cost overruns from political roadblocks in British Columbia. Alberta officials went so far as to threaten cutting off oil supplies to British Columbia in retaliation. Sanders was unavailable for an interview Tuesday, a company spokesman said. Robyn Allen - a vocal pipeline opponent and retired chief executive of an auto insurance firm - has long predicted the expansion would end in a government bailout.

By using assets of the existing Trans Mountain pipeline to finance its expansion, Kinder Morgan made the two inseparable in the bailout, Allen said. Finance Minister Morneau declined to comment in a morning news conference on the costs to complete the project. The government hopes to quickly resell the project to energy firms, a task made much harder by its tortured political history. Though Trudeau asserts federal authority to approve the project, British Columbia officials could effectively bog it down for years in environmental studies, lawsuits and regulations that undercut its profit potential. The prime minister is already paying the political price. The flack is flying from opponents on the right, too, including from Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, head of the largest opposition party.

The spill was detected Friday at a site 10 kilometres north of Stoughton in a low-lying area with a frozen slough. Doug MacKnight, assistant deputy minister of Economy, says about 170,000 litres have been recovered so far. MacKnight says the oil is not entering any creeks or streams. MacKnight says the government was notified about the spill on Friday, but details were only made public Monday when the volume of the spill became clear. The land is part of the Ocean Man First Nation. The Economy Ministry's petroleum and natural gas division will oversee cleanup and pipeline repairs. MacKnight says the province has sent a pipeline engineer to the site, but it will take some time to determine the cause of the spill. Tundra Energy Marketing is handling the cleanup, but MacKnight says there are several pipelines in the area and could not confirm that Tundra owns the pipeline that leaked. The spill is nearly the size of a leak in a Husky Energy (TSX:HSE) pipeline last July near Maidstone, Sask. The Husky leak jeopardized the drinking water of thousands of people after about 225,000 litres of oil was spilled and about 40 per cent made it into the North Saskatchewan River. The cities of North Battleford, Prince Albert and Melfort were forced to shut their intakes from the river and find other water sources for almost two months. The company said it recovered about 210,000 litres of oil spilled before it wrapped up shoreline cleanup efforts in October. Husky's report into the spill said shifting ground was to blame for the pipeline burst.

We thank President Obama for halting construction of the pipeline, and call on him to stop it permanently. And we call on North Dakota Governor Dalrymple to reverse his evacuation order and end the attacks on protestors. This pipeline would carry toxic fracked oil from North Dakota across four states, and under the Missouri River immediately upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, threatening the air, water and land for millions. In a classic example of environmental racism, construction of the pipeline went forward without input from the indigenous people along the route. Profits were placed before people when eminent domain was used to seize land in the interest of private corporations. We support the demands of the thousands of indigenous activists who have set up resistance camps to prevent completion of the pipeline. They are frontline activists in the growing movement across the nation against dangerous dirty fuel pipelines. These protesters are standing up for us all because construction of pipelines exacerbates the destructive effects of climate change. As healthcare workers, we are alarmed by the dire threats to public health posed by climate change, such as increases in asthma and the spread of viruses like Zika, Chikungunya and West Nile. As union members, we reject the notion that our country needs to choose between good jobs and a clean environment. In fact, the key to a cleaner and safer environment and the end of climate degradation is the creation of millions of good union jobs that contribute to economic growth as well as repair our crumbling infrastructure, including our roads, schools, hospitals and bridges. We desperately need infrastructure repairs such as the replacement of lead-filled and corroded pipes in cities like Flint, rather than the laying of oil pipes in our rivers and on sacred land. Therefore, we must immediately halt all new dirty-fuel infrastructure, and instead begin massive investments in clean energy manufacturing, construction, research and development. The Standing Rock Sioux Nation and their allies are contributing to this positive process. They are leading the way to a cleaner, safer environment and a more democratic energy policy that places the interests of people above the profits of the dirty fuel industry. We stand with them.

The climate is quickly changing in a warming trend that's been dramatically effecting the seasons for a long time now, with the polar ice caps melting to catastrophic effect. Bearing the brunt of this global impact are the Inupiaq people, who have relied upon seasonality to provide for their families for over 4,000 years. Worsening storms from enormous ice melts and longer warm seasons have caused so much damage to their small island, that the tribe has already moved their homes back from the shoreline once. Sadly, that's not enough to save it. Shishmaref will soon be totally under water. The good news is that part of the mainland has been reclaimed for their tribe. They will still have their ancestral hunting grounds and fishing territories, though serious adjustments will be made by their moving. They have been an island people for a very long time.

Photograph: Alamy The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project is no ordinary pipeline. This project, which the government of Canada has just decided to nationalise, will travel more than 1,000km from northern Alberta through unspoiled wilderness to end at the port of Vancouver. The port is on the Salish Sea, part of the hereditary territory of the Squamish People. Majestic orcas swim in the waters and feed on the abundance. You may think all First Nations are against pipelines. Think again Read more You might remember Vancouver from the 2010 Winter Olympics: beautiful mountains, clear water and clean air. It defies common sense. Because there is an existing, much smaller pipeline there. The decision by the government of Canada to take over the Trans Mountain pipeline Expansion Project is yet another example of indigenous rights being ignored in Canada. The prime minister, Justin Trudeau, promised to do things differently than his predecessors. He promised indigenous peoples that our rights would be respected, and he has broken that promise, yet again. He promised us he would put pipeline expansion through a brand-new review, and instead the government is spending billions of dollars to buy it and, if necessary, complete and operate it over our objections. Of the 117 indigenous groups who were a part of the consultation by the government, nearly two-thirds did not agree By the way, the original pipeline carried 150,000 barrels of oil per day, which was primarily for domestic use. Today it carries 300,000 barrels, achieved by adding more pumping stations and pushing through more oil. So when the megapipe, with an estimated daily load of 800,000 barrels, is built, that capacity is only the beginning: it could double in capacity, with very little anyone could do about it. That is the minimum number of oil tankers; it could be more. A single incident would render the beautiful beaches of the city, surrounding islands and Vancouver Island uninhabitable. It would kill the Salish Sea and destroy our Squamish territory. That is the reality no one wants to talk about. It will destroy the Salish sea. Alberta is already able to sell its oil through pipelines to the US. That oil is already being exported around the world, in ever-growing amounts, through US oil ports. We know that, if built, this is a 50- to 60-year risk. We know that financial constraints could make government or companies cut back on spill mitigation or prevention. In Canada we have seen cash-strapped governments close coast guard bases, lighthouses and weather stations, and allow search and rescue fleets and aircraft to age without being properly replaced. Governments cut back on oversight of all industries on a regular basis, only to express surprise when something goes wrong. And those are just the things we can control. Certainly, the Canadian government will never inspect them. If you know this port, it has a very narrow opening, aptly called First Narrows. Medium-sized cruise ships barely fit.

There's good reason to say so: the pipeline expansion will carry 890,000 barrels of oil per day. That's 420,000 more barrels than the Dakota Access pipeline and 60,000 more barrels than the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. The new pipeline expansion will also increase the number of oil tankers in the Salish Sea by a factor of seven. And those tankers will be carrying a type of oil that is particularly destructive to marine environments. Tar sands oil, unlike the type of crude fracked from the Bakken, is heavy and sinks to the ocean floor. It's nearly impossible to clean up, and environmentalists say that the traffic from the oil tankers alone will further endanger Puget Sound's resident killer whale populations. But the Standing Rock North characterization holds true for another reason, too. Tribes in British Columbia and Washington State are on the front lines of this fight, and they may be the only people with the standing to stop the continued destruction of a body of water stewarded by both Canadians and Washingtonians. The Tsleil-Waututh Nation in British Columbia has been fighting the Kinder Morgan pipeline for years. The pipeline terminus is located directly across a waterway from tribal land, just north of Vancouver, and tribal leaders say that approving the pipeline infringes on Aboriginal rights. Three years ago, all four tribes stood in front of Canada's National Energy Board and explained that expanding the pipeline would threaten their fishing livelihoods. Swinomish Indian Tribal Community chairman Brian Cladoosby, who told the board that an oil tanker had once plowed through a Swinomish fisherman's net, said that he wasn't just there on behalf of Native communities. US tribes don't have the same legal standing with the Canadian government that First Nations do. But Earthjustice attorney Kristen Boyles says that the Canadian government's pipeline decision still ignored US treaties between tribal nations and the US government. Fred Felleman, whale biologist and Port of Seattle commissioner, says he believes tribes are the only groups left that have the power to challenge the Canadian government's decision."}, {"URL": "http://www.eenews.net/eenewspm/2016/12/06/stories/1060046749", "Timestamp": "20180918233106", "Sentences": "E&E Home About Contact Start a Trial Subscribe Energywire Climatewire E&E Daily Greenwire E&E News PM Reports E&E News PM Late-Breaking News Tue., Sep. 18 Mon., Sep. 17 Fri., Sep. 14 Thu., Sep. 13 Edition Archive Search: Back to table of contents.

The cleanup is expected to last for weeks, according to Miranda Jones, vice president of environmental safety at Crestwood Midstream Partners LP. A subsidiary of Crestwood - Arrow Pipeline LLC - owns the underground pipeline. Yet Karolin Rockvoy, a McKenzie County emergency manager, visited the site of the leak and said, based on the amount of devastation done to local vegetation, the spill had probably gone undetected for some time. The pipeline was not equipped with technology that alerts operators of a leak, Jones said. Last year, the state legislature rejected legislation mandating pipeline flow meters and cutoff switches. It is as yet unknown how much of this saltwater - between 10 and 30 times saltier than sea water and considered an environmental hazard by the state of North Dakota - found its way into Bear Den Bay, which leads to Lake Sakakawea. The lake supplies water for the reservation, where the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara tribes live in an area of western North Dakota that is experiencing an unprecedented drilling boom. Crestwood Midstream Partners LP and tribal officials maintain, though, that the spill is controlled and has not impacted the lake. The briny saltwater byproduct from drilling could contain petroleum and residue from hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, an energy intensive process that involves the injection of highly pressurized water, sand, and chemicals into layers of rock. The practice concerns geologists, and human and environmental health officials alike. Kris Roberts, environmental geologist with the North Dakota Department of Health, said the spill had already caused widespread damage at the site. The state produced 25.5 million barrels of brine in 2012. There were 141 pipeline leaks reported in the state that same year, 99 of which spilled around 8,000 barrels of saltwater, AP reports. State regulators say about 6,150 barrels of the leaked saltwater were recovered. One barrel equals 42 gallons of fluid. Possibly the worst environmental disaster ever in the state occurred in 2006, when a broken oil pipeline leaked more than a million gallons of saltwater into a creek, aquifer, and pond. Saltwater from the rupture spewed unnoticed for weeks into a tributary of the Yellowstone River near Alexander, North Dakota, causing the death of many fish, turtles, and plants. Cleanup efforts connected with that spill are ongoing. Saltwater pipelines in western North Dakota have since been connected in an elaborate network that empties into hundreds of disposal wells, where the brine is permanently stored underground. Fracking wastewater injected into storage wells has been linked to drastically increased seismic activity in areas with similar energy booms as North Dakota, including Oklahoma. All rights reserved.

At the time, officials believed the number to be approximately 176,000 gallons; however, according to state environmental experts , that number is actually closer to 530,000 gallons of oil: approximately three times larger than what was originally believed. Belle Fourche Pipeline is located approximately 150 miles away from Standing Rock , and is owned by True Cos. , a Wyoming-based company that encompasses several other pipelines , as well as oil and drilling businesses. Spokeswoman Wendy Owen explained that once the company was able to start investigating the origin of the leak, they were able to get a better sense of how much oil had actually been spilled. NBC reports that none of the oil has seeped into drinking water, according to Health Department environmental scientist Bill Seuss. He also adds that there have not been any livestock or wildlife deaths that have been confirmed to be related to the oil spill. However, this leak is still hugely significant. As noted by EcoWatch , this is one of the largest spills in North Dakota's history, and could potentially be the biggest spill in the state to have contaminated a body of water. The piles of snow resulted in the pipeline bending in two places, which caused it to tear. This is not the first time that North Dakota has dealt with the aftermath of an oil spill. In 2013, a leak in the Tesoro Corp. pipeline caused 840,000 gallons of crude oil to be spilled. To this day, three years and six months later, that spill has still not been fully cleaned .

I hauled coal, oil, goods and so on for more than 30 years as a railroad worker. The pipeline itself is unnecessary because we have ample rail capacity to haul all of North Dakota's crude oil safely by rail with newer and safer rail cars. We are currently only shipping three or four oil trains a day out of North Dakota, and we have the capacity to ship 100 trains a day with our state's 21 oil train loading facilities. Over the past five years, those loading facilities were built, costing hundreds of millions of dollars. So building the pipeline means hundreds of millions of dollars in stranded assets and lost opportunities for our state. Building this pipeline hurts North Dakotans, too. We have more than 200 railroad workers who are currently furloughed who would be put back to work if we shipped more oil by rail. While I support union construction workers who build pipelines, the truth is, most of these folks are from out of state, and this pipeline creates some jobs for a few months. North Dakota railroad workers live here, and shipping oil by rail will keep them employed for decades. Shipping oil by rail doesn't just benefit rail workers and our state's railroads. Revenues from shipping oil help pay for the maintenance of our entire rail system, and that benefits other shippers such as farmers, who depend on good rail lines to get their crops to market. The Dakota Access Pipeline ... well, it will ship oil. There are some who make the unsubstantiated claim that shipping oil by pipeline is safer than by rail. However you ship oil, there will be leaks and extensive clean-up projects; that's an unfortunate reality. But if a train does derail, it's almost always easily cleaned up compared with an underground pipeline leak. And besides new tank cars that are stronger and less likely to rupture and catch fire in a derailment, North Dakota has implemented new oil volatility rules that reduce the flammability of today's crude oil shipments, making shipping by rail far safer today than it was just two years ago. We already have the needed infrastructure in place to safely move all of North Dakota's crude oil by rail and put lots of railroad workers to work for decades, compared with employing hundreds of out of state workers for several months.

It remains the largest inland oil spill in U.S. history, Winona LaDuke writes. by Winona LaDuke Mar 3, 2017 LaDuke: The Largest Inland Oil Spill in U.S. History Happened Today in Minnesota. On this day, March 3, in 1991, the Line 3 pipeline ruptured near Grand Rapids, Minnesota, spilling over 1.7 million gallons of oil, much of which flowed into the Prairie River, after a negligently delayed response by the company. The Prairie is a tributary of the Mississippi, so were it not for the 18 inches of ice on top of the river, the spill could have poisoned the drinking water of millions downstream, and would likely be remembered very differently. Thankfully, this was back in the days when our territories were still frozen and snow-covered in March, before climate change had fully sunk its teeth. Due to sheer luck, the cleanup was relatively quick and effective, so the spill received nowhere near as much media attention as the catastrophic Kalamazoo River spill of 2010. It turns out that 1.1 million gallons of Alberta tar sands crude oil is not easily removed from riverbanks and sensitive wetlands. Minnesota, take heed. Line 3 is now 56 years old, well past its intended lifespan, but still carries crude oil across Northern Minnesota on its way from Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin, cutting directly across the Leech Lake and Fond du Lac Reservations. Many governmental reports refer to Lines 3 and 4 as a single unit, because of the complicated ways they work in tandem. Together, they are responsible for not only the 1991 Grand Rapids spill, but also the catastrophic 2002 spill near Cohasset, MN; the 2007 explosion in Clearbrook, MN, that killed two workers; a serious spill in Regina, Alberta in December 2014; and countless other ruptures and spills. A clean-up worker and his hose against millions of gallons of oil that spilled after a pipeline ruptured near Grand Rapids, Minnesota, on March 3, 1991 Line 3 is crumbling. They estimate over half a million structural anomalies in Line 3, which is about 1 every 10 feet. The company has reduced the pressure to the bare minimum that still allows oil to flow, and spends billions of dollars digging up and fixing pieces of it (they anticipate needing at least 12,000 integrity digs in the next decade just for maintenance). In other words, Line 3 is a ticking time bomb. They cite this as justification for building a new one. But that is backwards thinking. The rational response would be to shut it down immediately and prevent them from doing this again to our grandchildren. Instead of cleaning up this mess, and putting hard-working Minnesotan union members to work doing it, Enbridge simply plans to abandon the pipeline and inevitable contamination in the ground, walk away, and build an entirely new Line 3 pipeline in a brand new corridor. The State of Minnesota, including the Public Utilities Commission (PUC), has the power and responsibility to regulate pipeline abandonment, but there is currently no plan. Because Line 3 is the first crude oil pipeline to be abandoned in our state, there is a risk that the PUC will avoid their responsibility and set a disastrous precedent. But tribal governments, landowners, local businesses, and concerned community members across the north are standing up to say no, and demand accountability. The new Line 3 could eventually carry over a million barrels per day of tar sands, the dirtiest oil in the world. The proposed corridor threatens some of the shallowest aquifers, cleanest ground waters, most permeable soil types, and largest wild rice beds in North America. The route would also pierce the heart of Ojibwe treaty lands, where we retain the rights to hunt, fish, gather, hold ceremony, and travel. It is our responsibility as water protectors to prevent this. But this is not Morton County, and I hope we do not see armored vehicles deployed to brutalize our grandmothers and granddaughters as they stand in prayer. We expect Enbridge to clean up its old mess, and walk the enlightened path of clean energy. Until then, our communities will continue rising up to protect our waters.

Just two days earlier, a retired Kentucky miner suffering from black lung disease appeared at an EPA hearing in Colorado and, in opposition to industry representatives, called for more government oversight. New federal rules in effect Friday mark the first time in 45 years that federal officials have updated labor rules to prevent black lung disease, which is caused by inhaling toxic coal dust and silica in mines. By the time the rules are fully in effect in 2016, workers should be exposed to 25 percent less coal dust, saving lives. Companies also must sample throughout workers' 10- to twelve-hour shifts, take samples in more locations in the mine, and provide more medical screenings. The answer lies in the industry's aggressive opposition to reform: Whenever coal faces new regulations, the industry insists that its role as a job creator should take priority over pollution control. Just this week, pro-coal interests made this point in hearings on EPA climate regulations for carbon emissions. The rules are better late than never. Over four decades, more than 76,000 miners have died directly or indirectly from black lung. Those rates have risen in recent years in central Appalachia, most alarmingly among young workers. There are a number of reasons for this increase: Longer shifts and more effective mining equipment that creates more dust. But regulations could have helped in both cases. Before, mine supervisors did not have to monitor levels throughout a worker's shift. In 1998, the coal industry fought off a proposed coal dust update by filing a court appeal. Reporter Ken Ward attributed the delay to coal lobby pressure and Republican interference. Both the National Mining Association and Murray Energy have filed separate lawsuits against MSHA. Get the latest from TNR. Sign up for the newsletter. The coal industry isn't just fighting the government over black lung; it's fighting its own workers. In-depth investigations conducted by the Center for Public Integrity found the industry often colluded with doctors and deployed teams of lawyers against workers claiming black lung benefits, in order to downplay the number of cases. After the investigation, the Labor Department discovered that more than 1,000 miners may have been wrongfully denied their medical benefits. Rebecca Leber is a reporter at Mother Jones. New insights.

Investors concerned about the Dakota Access Pipeline have started submitting shareholder proposals to the energy companies building the pipeline as well as to the lenders behind it, urging the companies to better disclose the risks to their business from the controversial investment. In a shareholder resolution filed last month with Marathon Petroleum Corp., which said in August that it would buy a minority stake in the pipeline, the pension plan said that Marathon should disclose to investors how it does due diligence on environmental and human rights risks, including indigenous rights risks, when it comes to M&A decisions. A spokesman for New York State Common Retirement Fund declined to comment beyond the resolution itself. Energy Transfer Partners LP owns the project jointly with Phillips 66 and Sunoco Logistics Partners LP. Marathon and Enbridge Energy Partners LP announced a joint venture in August that would also take a minority stake in the pipeline. Spokesmen at Marathon and Enbridge declined to comment. Jeff Shields, a spokesman for Sunoco Logistics, said the company has not received any shareholder resolutions on the pipeline. An Energy Transfer spokeswoman declined to comment and referred Bloomberg Briefs to a Sept. 13 memorandum about the pipeline by chairman and chief executive officer Kelcy Warren. Other investors are also pushing the issue. Boston Common Asset Management, for example, said last month on its website that it is helping to craft shareholder proposals for Marathon, Phillips 66 and Enbridge that it expects will be filed in coming weeks. The fund is focusing on these companies because the other major partners in the pipeline are limited partnerships and therefore can't receive proxy proposals from shareholders, Boston Common said. The uproar over the pipeline is part of a broader environmental and social debate over whether there is a need for more fossil fuel conduits across the U.S. and whether these projects trample over the rights of indigenous people. While some investors are raising their concerns with the energy companies themselves, other shareholder groups are going directly to the lenders funding the disputed pipeline. The group has also co-filed proposals at Marathon and is planning another at Phillips 66, Fugere said. Rebecca Adamson, founder and president of First Peoples Worldwide, which advocates for funding local development projects in indigenous communities, estimates that at least eight shareholder resolutions have been filed with energy companies and banks involved in the pipeline. The largest lenders involved in the pipeline include Citigroup Global Markets Inc., TD Securities USA LLC, Mizuho Bank Ltd., and Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., according to Bloomberg data. TD said it has retained law firm Foley Hoag LLP, an independent human rights expert, on behalf of the lenders to conduct a review and make recommendations to improvements to Energy Transfer's and Sunoco Logistics' social policies and procedures. Foley Hoag confirmed that it would be working on the review. Representatives at Wells Fargo and Mizuho did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Mitsubishi declined to comment. Some lenders are even taking the matter into their own hands. Norwegian bank DNB said last month that it was conducting an evaluation of how indigenous people's rights were being treated during the resolution of the conflict. The backlash over the Dakota Access crude pipeline may discourage companies from pursuing the construction of similar projects in the future without considering the impacts, said First Peoples Worldwide's Adamson.

Consumer, service and transportation businesses had more specific and detailed sustainability disclosures on material issues important to investors than companies whose models focus more on business-to-business sales, a study of 713 U.S. securities filings by the San Francisco-based Sustainability Accounting Standards Board found. Still, customers and investors don't have exactly the same needs, Guillot said. Customers may care about a company's exposure to forced labor or a chemical in its products, while investors may care about sustainability metrics that could drive profits and help them compare a company's performance to peers, she said. SASB is a non-profit that is working to set industry standards for companies to disclose material sustainability information in Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Boilerplate was found in 43 percent of all sustainability exposures analyzed, but was less common in European filers where there is more regulation on sustainability disclosure, SASB found. The fund says its ambition is to develop a portfolio in line with the 2-degree target that will be achieved by integrating climate analysis into investment process. AP2 has previously divested from companies dedicated exclusively to coal extraction and in oil and gas companies with major investments in new high-cost projects. In total, AP2 has divested from 76 companies due to financial climate risks. Analysis: Low-Carbon Index Performance May Worsen Source: Bloomberg Intelligence. Indexes that exclude fossil-fuel extraction companies or companies with high carbon emissions have generally underperformed their benchmarks by about half a percentage point this year, as oil and gas company shares rallied. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to exit the Paris climate accord and roll back regulations may support high-carbon company prospects and dim those for low-carbon solution providers. Declining renewables and low-carbon technology costs may provide longer-term low-carbon support. The index will contain both investment grade and non-investment grade bonds. The fund, which is set to list on the NYSE Arca, would be the first green bond ETF out of 1,900 ETFs currently trading and 1,200 in registration, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior ETF analyst Eric Balchunas.

While it is not technically a green bond because the proceeds are not used to fund a green project, bondholders have the option to receive their interest payments in the form of cash or voluntary carbon units. The carbon units will come from a reforestation project in east Kenya, IFC said. SNCF's Novel Transport Green Bond SNCF is using proceeds from green bonds to both refinance and fund the French rail system.

More than 14 percent of U.S. consumers looked for apparel and accessories made from natural materials in 2016, up from 12.9 percent last year, according to a Euromonitor International survey. Shoppers looking for clothes that were reused or recycled rose 2 percent this year. This shift to so-called sustainable clothing is threatening the underpinnings of a fashion industry that wants consumers to rapidly change styles and move on to the next hot trends. The challenge may come earlier than big retail chains expect. Consumers are more willing to shop at niche, smaller companies this season, according to Deloitte LLP. But fast-fashion companies are trying to respond. In 2013, H&M launched a worldwide garment-collecting initiative encouraging consumers to reuse and recycle their clothes. Zara launched its first sustainable line, Join Life, in September. And the very nature of high-turnover fast-fashion companies strikes many as unsustainable, she said. She said the biggest challenge for retailers will be to make sustainable products affordable and accessible to millennials. Lowering prices for sustainable collections would help these businesses stay relevant, as most consumers shop at H&M and Zara because of the cheap price tags. Still, some in the industry are pushing the notion that millennials will save money by spending a bit more on longer-lasting items. Kim founded Los Angeles-based Dosa after moving from Seoul. Her idea started in West Bengal, where she began collecting old saris to incorporate into new designs. Kim tracked her expenses in both regular and recycled production. With traditional clothing production, 40 percent of her expenses went to materials, 53 percent to labor, and 7 percent to shipping and other duties. With a recycled production, Kim spent 14 percent on materials, 81 percent on labor, and 5 percent on shipping and duties.

Sounds crazy, but the damage makes perfect business sense under the no pain, no gain policy driving the electric-vehicle boom in the U.S. California crafted the doctrine, with tough clean-air rules and a mandate that automakers sell some non-polluting vehicles if they want to do business in the Golden State. Nine others have adopted it, New York and New Jersey among them, and all told they make up close to 30 percent of the U.S. market. That goes a long way to explaining why zero-emissions models from more than 10 brands are on the roads, with more on the way. The hurdles may go higher: Brown, a Democrat with two years left in his term, signed a law ordering greenhouse-gas emissions be 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030.

As content of dubious authenticity swirls on platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google, many in the media worry consumers may lose trust in stories that are actually true. Maybe most uncomfortable are the social media companies, Facebook especially. They make millions in ad revenue by distributing information, but the last thing they want are the responsibilities that come with being a publisher, like ensuring stories are accurate. Shares of the social media and internet companies have underperformed the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index since the US election on Nov. 8. All exporters of gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten to the EU have to trace the origin of the four minerals. Importers must do due diligence checks.

Governance News in Brief Hidden: to copy text from: full story full terminal story Securities Regulators Warn of Risks to Auditor Independence Securities regulators urged companies and auditors to keep auditor independence issues in mind as enterprises begin to apply major new accounting rules and have questions about how to apply them. At the same time, ongoing dialogue between auditors and the companies, whose books they audit, carry benefits in improved financial reporting and better auditing, officials said Nov. 29. The announcement by the Rye, N.Y.-based asset manager ends the first attempt by any investor to utilize proxy access for gaining a board seat. The mechanism allows shareholders to nominate their own board candidates. Last month Gamco, which owns a 7.8 percent stake in NFG, nominated former Goldman Sachs partner Lance Bakrow as a proxy access candidate to the Williamsville, N.Y.-based natural gas company's nine-member board. Bakrow decided to withdraw his nomination, Gamco said in a Nov. 28 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ComScore, whose shares are down 30 percent this year, said last week that it would need to make accounting adjustments for some monetary transactions reviewed in the probe. The company also named a new chairman at the conclusion of a nine-month investigation that found the company lacked appropriate internal accounting controls. The biggest opportunities for impact investing are in emerging markets, especially in infrastructure, he said. Interviewed by Siobhan Wagner, Bloomberg Briefs, on Oct. 25. Comments have been edited and condensed for clarity. Q: Just to start off, I understand that you feel some impact investors are too picky, they apply too many investment screens, and this is causing a lack of deal flow. A: We always screen for those three things. It's more that we may say, for example, we want to do an infrastructure or financial inclusion deal, but we also want to be in a post-conflict country like Sierra Leone or Liberia. When we consider the investment opportunities in a country like that, we may find a transaction in a different sector, so not infrastructure or financial inclusion. It could be in agriculture or services. And because we want to be in that market, we will look at any sector. If impact investors want to scale up and invest a lot more, we really think emerging markets is where they can do it. If they invested even 1 percent of their portfolios in emerging market infrastructure, that would be enough to fill the financing gap. A: In a world where yields on sovereign debt, and things that are the big part of their portfolios, are close to zero, this is an attractive opportunity for them to get extra yield. A: What we're working on is various vehicles that allow institutional investors to invest in a big-ticket-size portfolio, rather than individual projects. We have a couple of models. One is through our asset management company. For example, we offer infrastructure funds, where if you want to invest equity in infrastructure, you can invest in an IFC-managed fund, and that fund invests in infrastructure projects. The second model we have on the debt side is a managed co-lending portfolio program. An insurance company has already made a commitment and we expect other investors to join the program. The idea there is they can invest in a larger ticket size: half a billion dollars or a billion dollars. We then take that money and invest it alongside IFC's own lending, project by project. A: I think it varies. There are fully commercial investors like pension funds and insurance companies, which are really just interested in the financial return. Then you have other investors, some high net worth investors, who are looking at both a financial and impact story. We think that infrastructure does offer a good impact story. Secondly, a lot of infrastructure investments have positive climate change benefits. A big part of our infrastructure program at the moment is in clean energy and retrofitting buildings for energy efficiency.

But despite relative ambivalence toward it by the Obama administration, research has continued apace. At the head of the pack are venture capitalists like Peter Thiel, the Silicon Valley billionaire who is said to be working on Trump's transition team. He's funded a fusion start-up called Helion Energy to pursue the ultimate dream of environmentalists. More than 100 plants have been canceled over the years. Fusion, meanwhile, would eliminate planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions if scientists could only harness its power. But that tantalizing promise of a grand solution has kept investors investing. A consortium of 35 countries are collaborating on a massive fusion project in southern France, called ITER. Fusion is also drawing in venture capitalists like Thiel, who think start-ups can achieve better results than national efforts. Energy from the reaction is used to generate electricity.

Wells Fargo, one of the nation's largest banks, won't be allowed to expand its business until it convinces the Fed it has cleaned up its act. The bank agreed to replace four members of its board of directors. The past 17 months have brought one bad headline after another. The bank's culture of misconduct extended well beyond the original revelations. Wells Fargo was dragged before Congress, put under the microscope by government officials, and embarrassed before its customers. A new CEO and management team were brought in, and the old regime lost millions of dollars in docked pay. 2016 September 8: Fake account scandal breaks wide open. Federal regulators reveal Wells Fargo employees secretly created millions of unauthorized bank and credit card accounts without their customers knowing it. Wells Fargo says 5,300 employees were fired for related reasons. September 14: A government official tells CNN the Department of Justice has issued subpoenas in a probe related to the fake account scandal. September 27: Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf forfeits pay. The first major executive leaves the company over the scandal. Carrie Tolstedt, who headed the division that created the fake accounts, steps down and forfeits some pay. September 28: Wells Fargo is accused of illegally repossessing service members' cars. The DOJ claims the bank took 413 cars without a court order, which violates federal law. The company apologizes and commits to refunds. September 29: Wells Fargo promises to abandon unrealistic sales goals. Wells Fargo employees blamed their bosses for effectively encouraging fake accounts. October 5: California's attorney general opens an investigation into possible identity fraud related to the fake accounts scandal. October 12: CEO John Stumpf steps down. The company announces he will retire effective immediately. November 3: SEC probe revealed. A new public filing from the bank discloses that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the bank for issues related to the creation of as many as 2 million fake accounts. December 13: Wells Fargo is punished by federal regulators for actions unrelated to the fake accounts. The bank is dinged for failing to comply with certain provisions of Dodd-Frank, the post-2008 law meant to better regulate big banks and protect consumers. 2017 January 23: Wells Fargo acknowledges potential worker retaliation. The bank says there are signs it retaliated against workers who tried to blow the whistle on the fake accounts. February 20: Four senior bank employees are fired. The employees either worked or used to work in Wells Fargo's community banking division, which is at the center of the fake account scandal. In an unusual move, a top federal banking regulator severely downgrades Wells Fargo's community lending rating. The decision stems from factors beyond the fake account scandal. March 27: Wells Fargo settles class action suit. April 10: Former executives are asked for money back. A new report from independent directors on the Wells Fargo board reveals the bank prepared an internal report in 2004 about practices that may encourage employees to create fake accounts. April 21: The bank's cost of a settlement goes up. June 14: New allegations about mortgages are leveled. In a new lawsuit, Wells Fargo is accused of modifying mortgages without authorization from the customers. That means some customers could have ended up paying the bank more than they owed. It's unclear how many customers were affected. July 27: New allegations about auto insurance are revealed. The bank admits it charged at least 570,000 customers for auto insurance they did not need. Wells Fargo says an internal review found about 20,000 customers may have defaulted on their car loans for related reasons. August 4: Wells Fargo is sued for allegedly ripping off small businesses. August 31: More fake accounts are discovered. Wells Fargo says it has found 1.4 million additional phony accounts. This brings the total number of fake accounts to 3.5 million. October 3: Wells Fargo says it wrongly fined mortgage clients. Wells Fargo admits that 110,000 mortgage holders were fined for missing a deadline -- even though the delays were the company's fault. The company pledges to refund the customers. October 16: Regulators say Wells Fargo sold dangerous investments it didn't understand. Wells Fargo does not admit to nor deny the charges. November 13: Wells Fargo admits it illegally repossessed more service members' cars. The company says it found that it had taken vehicles from another 450 service members. The company promises refunds. 2018 February 2: The Federal Reserve punishes Wells Fargo. In an unprecedented move, the Fed says the bank won't be allowed to grow its assets until the bank cleans up its act. The bank also agrees to overhaul its board of directors. --CNNMoney's Donna Borak, Danielle Wiener-Bronner and Jill Disis contributed to this report. Copyright 2018 by CNN NewSource.

Advocates see his quick action to pave the way for two oil pipelines as indications a possible harbinger of further cuts to national preservation programs. Whatever signals Trump gave during the transition that he is open to some environmental causes seem to have been tossed aside. Those actions, though expected, frustrated environmentalists. Last month, under the outgoing Obama administration, the Army Corps of Engineers denied a permit needed for a crucial segment of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access Pipeline that would cross under the Missouri River just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Dakota Access Pipeline would connect Bakken oil fields with Illinois, while Keystone XL could link the Gulf Coast with controversial Canadian oil sands. Environmentalists point to climate research that says oil sands emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases when compared with other forms of oil production. Green groups point out that new technologies also create jobs, but not at the expense of the environment. In addition to reviving the pipelines, the new administration instructed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to freeze all contracts and grants, which fund research, and stop releasing updates through social media platforms.

On Tuesday, the West Virginia Supreme Court ruled that developers of the proposed Mountain Valley Pipeline, which would carry fracked natural gas from West Virginia 300 miles to southern Virginia, can't survey land for the project without landowners' permission. The ruling upheld an August 2015 decision by a Monroe County circuit judge in favor of Bryan and Doris McCurdy, county residents who claimed that allowing the pipeline company onto their property without their consent violated their rights. The pipeline would supply little if any gas to Monroe County residents or other West Virginians. The Mountain Valley Pipeline is a joint project of Pennsylvania-based EQT Midstream Partners; NextEra US Gas Assets, a wholly owned subsidiary of of Florida-based NextEra Energy; WGL Midstream, a subsidiary of WGL Energy of Washington, D.C.; and Vega Midstream, a subsidiary of Houston-based Vega Energy. EQT Midstream Partners would operate the pipeline and own a majority interest. The pipeline would be up to 42 inches in diameter and require about 50 feet of permanent easement and 125 feet during construction. It would also require three compressor stations, which are planned for the Wetzel, Braxton, and Fayette counties in West Virginia. The pipeline needs approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) before construction can begin. In North Carolina, a threat to an Indian tribe Meanwhile, protests are mounting against the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which would run 550 miles from the gas fields of West Virginia to North Carolina. The companies behind the project are Dominion Resources of Virginia, North Carolina-based Duke Energy and Southern Company Gas, a subsidiary of the Atlanta-based Southern Company. There have been numerous protests against the project in Virginia, and this week they're spreading to eastern North Carolina counties that the pipeline would traverse, with three protest walks planned for Saturday, Nov. 19: In Cumberland County, pipeline protesters will gather at 9:30 a.m. in front of Cape Fear Regional Theater in Fayetteville and walk a mile for a rally at Market House. The event is sponsored by Cumberland County Caring Voices. In Nash County, protesters will meet at 10 a.m. at Ennis Recreation Park in Red Oak and walk 9 miles to the county courthouse in Nashville, with shuttles available to carry participants back to Red Oak. Nash Stop the Pipeline is the action's sponsor. And in Robeson County, protesters will meet at Pembroke Town Park across from UNC Pembroke at 1:30 p.m. and walk 2 miles for a rally and prayer circle at the corner of Prospect Road and Highway 72. The event's sponsor is EcoRobeson. The three counties hosting protests this week were all hit hard last month by Hurricane Matthew, an extreme weather event that scientists have connected to climate change. Pipelines often leak, and natural gas is mostly methane, a powerful greenhouse gas and significant contributor to global warming. Other groups involved in the North Carolina protest walks include Sustainable Sandhills, Clean Water for North Carolina, NC WARN, Appalachian Voices and Climate Times. Planning is also underway for a two-week protest walk to be held next spring along the entire 165 miles of the pipeline's planned route through North Carolina. 'A shortsighted industry' There are growing concerns about the proposed pipelines' impacts on the environment and public safety. The evidence shows that pipeline accidents are not that rare. And a consortium monitoring oil and gas industry accidents in Louisiana released its latest report this week, documenting six pipeline accidents in that one state over a two-week period. There were incidents involving pipelines operated by big companies including Exxon and Shell as well as smaller companies. Rolfes noted that the industry claims it's motivated to prevent pipeline accidents in order to avoid product loss. But she said that in her 20 years of studying oil and gas industry accidents, she has found little evidence to support that. Instead, she sees an intense focus on quarterly profits, which are depressed by investing in upgrades. But one area where the natural gas pipeline industry has been eager to invest is politics. database. That total includes contributions from individuals and political action committees as well as money to outside political groups not affiliated with campaigns, with 83 percent of that going to Republicans.

Locals said it felt like a tornado and sounded like a freight train, and they could see flames from around 20 miles away, EcoWatch reported. TransCanada said in a statement they do not yet know the cause of the explosion. No employees were at the site when the pipeline ruptured around 4:15 a.m. EST, and the fire was at least a mile away from the closest home, Marshall County director of emergency management Tom Hart told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. BREAKING: More pictures from a viewer of the explosion. The fire was fully extinguished by approximately 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said officials from the U.S. Forestry Service and West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection were on the site. This picture sent to me from a viewer in Short Creek, WV. He said some of those companies turned off the flow in their own pipelines, and that natural gas well operators shut down wells close by.

They say the route beneath Lake Oahe puts the water source in jeopardy and would destroy sacred land. North Dakota officials estimate more than 176,000 gallons of crude oil leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline into the Ash Coulee Creek. State environmental scientist Bill Suess says a landowner discovered the spill on Dec. 5 near the city of Belfield, which is roughly 150 miles from the epicenter of the Dakota Access pipeline protest camps. The leak was contained within hours of the its discovery, Wendy Owen, a spokeswoman for Casper, Wyoming-based True Cos., which operates the Belle Fourche pipeline, told CNBC. It's not yet clear why electronic monitoring equipment didn't detect the leak, Owen told the Asssociated Press. Owen said the pipeline was shut down immediately after the leak was discovered. United States Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy said the best path forward was to explore alternative routes for the pipeline, something Energy Transfer Partners says it will not do. Energy Transfer Partners says the Dakota Access pipeline would include safeguards such as leak detection equipment and that workers monitoring the pipeline remotely in Texas could close valves within three minutes if a breach is detected. Republican President-elect Donald Trump has voiced support for the Dakota Access Pipeline. About 5,000 people are still occupying land near the planned construction site. The 6-inch steel Belle Fourche pipeline is mostly underground but was built above ground where it crosses Ash Coulee Creek, Suess said. Owen said the pipeline was built in the 1980s and is used to gather oil from nearby oil wells to a collection point. Suess said the spill migrated almost 6 miles from the spill site along Ash Coulee Creek, and it fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. The creek feeds into the Little Missouri River, but Seuss said it appears no oil got that far and that no drinking water sources were threatened. The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over. About 60 workers were on site Monday, and crews have been averaging about 100 yards daily in their cleanup efforts, he said. Some of the oil remains trapped beneath the frozen creek. Suess says about 37,000 gallons of oil have been recovered. The 32,000-gallon spill temporarily shut down water supplies in the downstream community of Glendive, Montana, after oil was detected in the city's water treatment system. True Cos. operates at least three pipeline companies with a combined 1,648 miles of line in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming, according to information the companies submitted to federal regulators. Since 2006, the companies have reported 36 spills totaling 320,000 gallons of petroleum products, most of which was never recovered. Download the latest Flash player and try again.

National Observer News Opinion Special Reports Multimedia Garossino Trans Mountain Team Podcasts Ethics Search Search Sign up for your daily dose of news and inspiration. Photo by Trevor Mack An oilpatch lobby group paid Facebook to boost an online poll that skewed the level of support for Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain expansion. But the group won't say why it did it and Facebook didn't flag the activity as breaking any rules. The Texas giant's pipeline has sparked a fierce battle between the neighbouring provinces of Alberta and British Columbia, with new threats surfacing from Alberta Premier Rachel Notley to send B.C.'s gas prices soaring. While the post remained on the page, the lobby group appeared to stop paying for the advertising a few hours after National Observer asked what it was doing. CAPP declined to answer that question. Ultimately the poll, run by the Oak Bay News on Vancouver Island, was liked on Facebook thousands of times and by April 18, 2018 nearly 80 per cent of those who participated voted in support of the pipeline. That kind of support is a departure from scientific polls that show more divided opinions among British Columbians. On Friday, April 6, 2018, Canada's Energy Citizens sponsored a Facebook post urging people to vote in favour of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. Screenshot image Sponsoring posts on social media is a common and accepted practice to boost the visibility of a message through advertising (in fact, this publication pays to boost posts on Facebook regularly). But this ad is only one example of the style of online warfare that has pitted fossil fuel supporters against clean energy advocates in a battle to win the social media newsfeeds of the nation. Programming automated messaging can promote fake social media profiles to share and repost desired messages, ensuring that people see them while creating a sense that an opinion is popular and held by many people already. But researchers find bot activity on other issues, too. And it can be difficult to narrow down where bots originate, in terms of where the people who put them to work live in the real world. The oilpatch lobby group says it doesn't engage in bot activity. It describes the role of Canada's Energy Citizens as a voice for members of Canada's oil and gas community. The Facebook page for Canada's Energy Citizens works like a newsfeed for its followers, now numbering more than 220,000, increasing online traffic for articles, videos and opinion pieces that promote the oil industry. Each post shared can get dozens, or even hundreds, of shares from this following. Those numbers matter because the more likes and shares a post gets, the more likely it will show up in someone else's newsfeed. In the end, oilpatch marketing tactics, plus the marketing tactics of environmental detractors, plus the activities of bots add up, drowning out some people's voices and making it difficult for the average person to evaluate facts. It also isn't always easy to identify bots (or who is programming them, or why), though there are some clues. Researchers are still grappling with what effect automated, bot-like behaviour online can have on how people talk and think about big political problems. Interviewed by National Observer, he asked not to be identified, acknowledging that his tactics were also trying to game the system. Greenpeace communications officer Jesse Firempong, seen here in Vancouver on February 9, 2018, said suspicions about the newspaper polls were stirred because of unusual voting patterns. Photo by Mike De Souza Greenpeace flagged the possibility of bots swinging the results when two Vancouver Sun polls asking readers about Kinder Morgan started getting thousands of votes each. The number of participants seemed outsized compared to how many people normally vote in such polls, and pro-pipeline votes dwarfed anti-pipeline votes, contrary to a series of scientific polls that showed people were split on the matter. In the case of the online poll promoted by the oilpatch lobby group, CAPP was directing its fanbase to a Vancouver Island newspaper's poll on the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. These activities are just examples of how the online conversation around the troubled oil pipeline is, increasingly, being taken to extremes by actors on both sides of the debate. In these fights, messages can be spread faster and the debate can become more polarized with sponsored ads and automated bots. Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers spokeswoman Chelsie Klassen speaks during a news conference in Ottawa on Feb. 26, 2018. In Canada, users can see lists of sponsored posts as part of a Facebook experiment to enhance transparency. She declined to share the cost of urging people to vote in an Oak Bay News poll or explain why the post was sponsored. The ad was posted before noon eastern time on Fri. April 6, and was no longer on the citizens' group's list of purchased ads at 2:45 p.m. the same day. Only the Oak Bay News link appears to have been sponsored.

April 9, 2018. Whereas the recent online newspaper polls show a great deal of support for the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain expansion, scientific polls indicate a range of more nuanced positions. As examples, one Angus Reid online poll of 2,501 Canadians showed people are mostly split on the pipeline debate, while another, of 2,125 Canadians conducted in mid-April, showed 34 per cent of British Columbians feel environmental risks outweigh economic risks and 35 per cent feel the opposite. Angus Reid pollsters found about 30 per cent said the pipeline's risks and benefits are about equal. They also found that 54 per cent of British Columbians supported the pipeline expansion now, compared to 48 per cent in February. Meantime a Forum Research telephone survey of 1,061 eligible voters in B.C. showed 43 per cent of respondents believe the pipeline will be good for the economy, and 50 per cent believe it will be bad for the environment. And an online Abacus Data poll of 900 adult British Columbians found a wide expanse of wiggle room between those who absolutely oppose the pipeline (22 per cent) and those who absolutely support it (23 per cent). These polls don't just show diverse opinions among British Columbians, they are transparent about how people are surveyed, how a sample of respondents compares to the wider population, and what the likelihood is of findings reflecting the positions of the broader public. Depending on their authors' intent, a simple bot strategy on Twitter might be to re-post messages of interest, making it look like there are many people who hold the same position, or actively working to bully and drown out contrary voices. Such tactics have been used for multiple political campaigns around the world, including the recent scandals involving tech firms that used personal data to sway voters in the recent U.S. elections as well as the Brexit referendum in Europe. But bots aren't a Twitter-only issue. Gray noted they can also be found at work on Pinterest, Instagram, dating apps and other online platforms. They also aren't inherently bad: a company might build a chat bot into its website for customer service, for example. In that case, when you make a complaint online, a window might open and you'll be asked a series of standard follow-up questions before you are connected to a real person. The order of questions and pre-set responses are written by a person. If you say you want to cancel an order, the bot can be programmed to ask you why. Depending on what you say, the bot will provide you with additional information, or ask you more questions according to a script. That, he said, puts public opinion at risk of manipulation. In the news In December, someone who specializes in computer security research tried their own bot out on a Vancouver Sun poll and shared their results with Greenpeace. As his automated anti-pipeline votes ticked up, pro-pipeline votes appeared to increase in response. In the end, more than 20,000 people weighed in (most on the side of the pipeline expansion going through). Screen capture of a Vancouver Sun poll on Kinder Morgan, taken on Feb. 22, 2018 Sun editor-in-chief Harold Munro noted that the company they use for their daily polls, Poll Daddy, tracks users' IP addresses and cookies to prevent people from voting more than once. Special interest and advocacy groups on both sides of an issue often share a link to a poll with their members and like-minded groups, urging them to vote. The Sun's daily polls often ask readers to respond to news of the day, and generally seem to net just a few hundred votes. In May of last year, when the Sun asked about a Vancouver Aquarium decision to ban new dolphins, whales and porpoises from captivity, nearly 14,000 votes were cast (about 46 per cent of respondents in favour of the ban, 54 per cent against) The outliers that Greenpeace picked up on were published on Dec. 9, 2017 and Jan. 31, 2018. Munro did not respond to follow-up questions about whether his newspaper is worried about or looking into bot interference in its online polls. Canada's Energy Citizens started to expand rapidly in 2014, when Canadian pipeline operators such as TransCanada and Enbridge were aggressively trying to promote pipeline projects such as Energy East, Keystone XL, and Northern Gateway. A leaked TransCanada strategy document at that time revealed details of a plan to attack the reputation of critics and build an army of online activists to promote the company's messaging on Energy East. Following the leak, TransCanada confirmed that it had solicited the strategy but said that it had never fully been deployed. Bot activity new normal, but impacts untested At the University of Ottawa, the Vancouver Sun poll numbers are no surprise for Elizabeth Dubois, an assistant professor in the department of communication. Dubois and Concordia University assistant professor Fenwick McKelvey recently analyzed the effects of Twitter bots in Canada's 2015 election. So far, they have found people writing scripts that put bots to work amplifying and silencing messages, but how influential this work is remains to be seen. Looking toward the 2019 federal election, Dubois cautioned real people do write the programs that put bots to work. Kennedy Stewart, the NDP MP for the British Columbia riding of Burnaby South and a professor of public policy on leave from Simon Fraser University, easily dismissed the newspaper polls, comparing them to a radio station that asks people if a hockey player should be removed from their team roster. Last month, Stewart and May were both arrested alongside others blockading Kinder Morgan's pipeline terminal in Burnaby, B.C. To date, nearly 200 people have been arrested at the site; last week a B.C. Supreme Court judge suggested that those arrested under civil charges for violating a court injunction should face criminal charges. Investigative journalism has never been more important.

Governor Scott is backing the project despite the fact that one of the companies building the pipeline, Spectra Energy, has a long documented history of accidents. NextraEnergy, FPL's parent company, and Duke Energy, another one of the major so-called legalized monopoly energy companies in Florida, both own stakes in the pipeline and also happen to have donated heavily to both Scott's campaign and pretty much every Republican in the Florida Legislature.

The government has already seized 25 properties in Florida using eminent domain laws to make room for the trail. Unlike the Dakota Access Pipeline, however, the Sabal Trail doesn't cut through sacred Native American land, which is perhaps why national activists haven't paid the project the same level of attention. However, the Sabal pipeline will cross the Santa Fe, Suwannee, and Withlacoochee Rivers, which contain invaluable stretches of vulnerable Florida wetlands. Given the potential for environmental catastrophe, three campsites have sprung up in Florida: one in Live Oak and others in Fort Drum and Branford.

TransCanada shut down a portion of its highly contested Keystone Pipeline, which transports oil from the Canadian tar sands to refineries in the U.S., at 6 a.m. on Thursday after 210,000 gallons, or around 5,000 barrels, of oil spilled across South Dakota farmland.

The spill also comes just days before a crucial moment for the pipeline: Nebraskans will vote on Monday whether to approve the final step in the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would move 830,000 extra barrels of Canadian oil through the Midwest to refineries in Texas and Illinois.Worries of water contamination A viscous type of oil called diluted bitumen, or tar sands oil, flows through the Keystone Pipeline. Bitumen is also one of the dirtiest fuels in the world. The company did not respond to a request for further comment. After the last major Keystone oil spill in South Dakota, in April 2016, TransCanada revised its initial estimate of the spill from 187 gallons to 16,800 gallons after the company started digging up the field where the spill occurred. Because diluted bitumen is so dense, it seeps into the soil and river beds rather than rising like conventional, lighter crude, potentially masking the full spill. That could make spills less costly for oil companies like TransCanada but more expensive for landowners and communities. Another concern for Moeckly is the proximity of the spill to the Crow Creek drainage ditch, a small tributary to a major water supply for South Dakota, which flows just a few dozen feet from where the spill happened. A spill from the Keystone XL pipeline over this aquifer, in a worst-case scenario, could contaminate 5 billion gallons of water. But President Donald Trump put the pipeline back on track in one of his first executive orders earlier this year.A crucial moment The spill comes at another critical moment for the future of the Keystone XL pipeline, which has triggered massive protests since its proposal. Diverse groups, such as Native American tribes, landowners, farming associations, and environmental conservation groups, have argued the pipeline unnecessarily threatens the environment. On Monday, five members of the Nebraska Public Service Commission will vote on whether to go forward with the Keystone XL Pipeline, which would add 1,179 miles to the existing Keystone system. All the extension needs to move forward is approval on a 275-mile portion of the pipeline that cuts through Nebraska.

(photo: AP) Where We Drill, We Spill: Commemorating Exxon Valdez By Franz Matzner, Natural Resources Defense Council 24 March 17 wenty eight years ago today the world experienced a massive wake-up call on the hazards and harms of oil spills when the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open and poured oil into Alaskan waters. At the time, images of oil coated wildlife and a devastated ecosystem in one of the world's most delicate, iconic and majestic environments drew global attention. Today, oil still lurks under the surface of Prince William Sound, impairing wildlife and human lives. Eleven years later, BP's Deepwater Horizon oil rig exploded, killing 11 workers and spreading millions of gallons of crude throughout the Gulf of Mexico. Gulf communities are still trying to recover from this devastating blow to local economies and human health. Years of legal challenge and delay by the oil industry meant those least able to absorb the blow to their way of life abandoned and foundering. In the aftermath of the BP disaster, a non-partisan, blue ribbon commission was established to provide recommendations to mitigate the risk of future events, providing hope to communities already exposed to oil drilling that finally their voices would be heard. Despite these consensus proposals, adequate safety reforms have never been formulated, let alone implemented and even the progress that has been made is at risk. Sea ice is making repairs impossible, underscoring again the unique challenges of oil and gas exploration in Alaska's frozen and tumultuous waters. Wired reported in December that there are about 30,000 oil spills per year in U.S. waters, most of which are in the Gulf of Mexico. It's being killed, literally, by a thousand cuts. Nor are spills the only concern. Ongoing operations produce other pollutants, including toxic metals and carcinogens, that are dumped into the ocean. A toxic mix of metals, fluids and other drilling bi-products harm marine ecosystems and are suspected in increasing mercury levels in some fish populations. To say nothing of the infrastructure development that can rip apart habitats and the industries that rely on them. Its high risk designation, granted to the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement in 2016, indicates that the agency charged with limiting offshore oil spills is not doing its job effectively. Just this week, in fact, the Government Accountability Office released a report expanding on its findings about the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. And the House Oversight committee held a hearing on oil well safety, which focused on that report and further exposed the lack of meaningful safety measures as well as the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement's significant lack of staffing and resources. Fortunately, at the close of the previous administration, bold actions were taken to preserve and protect large swaths of our Arctic and Atlantic oceans from future oil disasters. These decisions came in direct response to the broad and unwavering call from all corners of the country to stop the expansion of oil drilling into these public waters and recognized that the rapid growth of clean energy means there is simply no need to expose our still oil-free beaches, local economies and climate to the inherent harms of offshore drilling. This victory is something that should be built on. Yet the Trump administration's oil cabinet and its allies in Congress have instead launched a systematic attack to do precisely the opposite, opening the door for these vital oceans owned by all American's to be sold and exploited at the behest of select private oil companies. The very first piece of legislation signed by President Trump was a gift to Exxon and global despots, designed to make it easier for oil, gas and coal companies to bribe foreign governments without accountability. And to complete the package, legislation is being proposed in the House and Senate that would open the door to a radical expansion of offshore drilling. One proposal would overturn recently finalized drilling safety standards specifically designed to meet recommendations made by the Oil Spill Commission. Draft legislation being circulated by Rep. Bratt (R-VA) and another bill introduced by Sen. Cassidy (R-LA) would remove current permanent protections in the Arctic Ocean, along the Atlantic coast and in Alaska's Bristol Bay, bar any future President from providing such protections and gut the underlying law that ensures public input into how public resources are utilized. Extreme by any measure, these legislative proposals should be rejected, even by those who do not oppose offshore drilling. It is simply unconscionable to discount the documented safety, environmental and health risks that come with offshore drilling and to put in place a system designed to exclude the coastal residents most in harm's way, flout the science of climate change and flatly reject the basic principles of responsible management of our public lands and oceans. Fortunately, across the country millions of concerned citizens, communities, businesses and local residents are ready to stand strong against this attempt to rob future generations of our pristine beaches, healthy oceans and a stable climate. Urge your Members of Congress to oppose Big Oil's plan to bring Big Spills back to our beaches. Ask them to instead cosponsor legislation to protect our oceans, communities and climate.

The decision came after years of speculation as to whether the administration would approve the pipeline for its stated energy security and economic benefits or reject it on environmental grounds like so many in the activist community have demanded. The pipeline became a point of heated contention because it would have transported oil derived from tar sands, a gooey mixture of hydrocarbon-rich bitumen, clay, sand, and water that is abundant in Western Canada. Because tar sands must be heated before their bitumen can be collected and processed, extracting oil from tar sands requires more energy (and associated greenhouse gas emissions) than conventional oil drilling. In their raw form, tar sands are a gooey mixture of clay, sand, water, and oil-rich bitumen. Meanwhile, supporters downplayed its environmental risks and touted the fact it would help create American jobs and increase oil imports from one of our strongest trading partners. Beyond the Politics: The Impacts of Keystone XL During the (several) years the Obama administration was weighing its decision to accept or reject Keystone XL, a number of thorough and unbiased reports analyzing its impact were released, including a State Department Environmental Impact Statement in 2011, an independent engineering assessment by Batelle in 2013, a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement in 2014, and a number of other relevant reports and academic papers. These reports all essentially agree on a few basic facts: 1) Keystone XL would not be a game changer for the U.S. economy; 2) tar sands oil produces more greenhouse gas emissions on a lifecycle basis than conventional oil; and 3) the Keystone XL pipeline is likely the best option for transporting oil from Canada's tar sands versus alternative options like rail. While this might sound like a lot, it is actually just 0.02 percent of total U.S. annual economic activity as measured in 2012. Furthermore, while the pipeline would create about 42,000 direct and indirect jobs during its two-year construction period, only 50 permanent jobs would remain after start of operations. Tar Sands Versus Conventional Oil A 2014 report by the respected and nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reviewed a number of government and independent studies that have investigated the total greenhouse gas emissions of gasoline derived from tar sands oil. Each bar represents a separate analysis. Put together, the results indicate gasoline from tar sands produces about 17 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than typical U.S. gasoline. (Source: Congressional Research Service) Gasoline from Canadian tar sands oil produces between 2 and 19 percent more emissions than gasoline derived from other sources of imported crude oil. (Source: Congressional Research Service) Considering the broad agreement between studies illustrated above, it is clear that tar sands oil itself produces more emissions than oil from alternative sources. However, this fact is only one of a series of factors that affect the actual emissions impact of the Keystone XL itself. The ultimate emissions impact of Keystone XL depends on how the emissions associated with pumping oil in a pipeline compare to alternative transportation options such as rail. Furthermore, it depends on the effect the pipeline has on the actual level of oil production from Canadian tar sands. Keystone XL Versus Alternative Transportation Modes In its latest environmental impact statement, the U.S. State Department directly compared the Keystone XL pipeline to five alternative options that would be used to transport Canadian tar sands oil: two alternative pipeline routes, and three scenarios that would likely occur if Keystone XL were not built. The findings indicate that Keystone XL would produce less transport greenhouse gas emissions than alternative options. Alternative methods of transporting oil derived from Canadian tar sands would produce between 2.8 and 41.8 percent more greenhouse gas emissions than the Keystone XL pipeline. (Source: U.S. State Department) Furthermore, the analysis found that Keystone XL would result in the lowest volume of spilled oil on a cumulative basis versus alternatives, as shown in the table below. (Source: U.S. State Department) The pipeline itself would likely produce less greenhouse gas emissions and result in less spilled oil than alternative transportation options. The amount of Canadian tar sands oil transported by rail increased significantly between January 2011 and November 2013 in the absence of adequate pipeline infrastructure. (Source: U.S. State Department) The rise in rail shipments of crude oil and the presence of other alternative transportation options prompted the State Department to conclude that: The dominant drivers of oil sands development are more global than any single infrastructural project. In line with this conclusion, the State Department assigned a rather wide range to the ultimate greenhouse gas emissions that it thinks would be produced as a result of Keystone XL: from a minimum of about 1 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions annually all the way to a maximum estimate of over 27 million metric tons annually. These values correspond to an increase in total annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions of 0.015 to 0.4 percent versus 2013 levels. In my opinion, the impact that one pipeline will have on production of oil from Canadian tar sands will almost certainly be lesser in magnitude than other larger market forces, such as the global price for oil, production from other onshore and offshore sources of oil, political instability, and a number of other factors that could influence the global oil market. Moreover, its impact on greenhouse gas emissions is likely less than other factors we can directly control, like limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants or methane leaks from the oil and gas supply chain. Getting to No: What Drove Obama to Delay and Then Reject Keystone XL Given the fact that Keystone XL likely would not increase greenhouse gas emissions in a serious way, and be safer than alternative transportation methods, you might be asking how Keystone XL morphed into the primary focus of many environmental activists in the United States and around the world. The answer to that question has more to do with politics and emotion than the actual facts at hand. Had there not been a major grassroots campaign against the pipeline, I believe the Obama administration would have approved the pipeline based on the findings of its own State Department. But of course, there was a significant (and at times vicious) campaign against Keystone XL. The political symbolism of Keystone XL drove President Obama to approach the question of the pipeline from not only a pragmatist, analytical perspective that considers its direct impacts, but also a political perspective that considers the indirect impact his decision would have on the global environmental movement and its efficacy around the world. President Obama was trapped between these two competing factors for years as he delayed his decision on the pipeline. In the end, he waited until the U.S. oil market had evolved to a point where Keystone XL became more relevant politically than practically, and he rejected the pipeline. The President will no doubt hold up his decision to reject the pipeline at the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris as a sign the United States is willing to act on climate. I hope that the political capital the administration gains from rejecting Keystone XL will make up for the fact that it was likely rejected based more on politics than the facts.

She is also a supporter of Keystone XL, and has said she supports an all-of-the-above energy strategy that leads to American energy independence. Coal did occupy a large portion of the time they spent talking, Heitkamp said. The topic of carbon credits also came up. North Dakota is uniquely positioned for carbon sequestration. Liquid carbon is being tested here for enhanced oil recovery by the Energy and Environmental Research Center, but at the same time, spent oil wells here would provide large reservoirs for future carbon sequestration. Marrying them with carbon credits could make the process financially attractive for coal companies, giving them a viable way to take their emissions out of the atmosphere while continuing to operate. Some in the cattle industry have suggested market manipulation is behind the recent volatility in the cattle market, where prices have hit historic lows.

The Keystone XL pipeline was intended to connect oil (technically diluted bitumen) from the oil sands of Alberta, Canada to refineries and ports on the Gulf of Mexico. The pipeline was strongly opposed by advocates for action on climate change because the processing required to extract useful oil from the thick bitumen makes it an even bigger source of CO2 emissions than usual. In November 2015, the Obama administration rejected the pipeline after a long period of uncertainty, citing the contribution to climate change and a lack of significant benefits in terms of jobs and US energy prices. The Dakota Access pipeline was intended to run between the Bakken Shale oil field in western North Dakota and facilities in Illinois, but protests near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation brought national scrutiny to the project. Details on how the Trump administration intends to get around these decisions are not yet available.

The rising cost of transporting oil from Permian wells in West Texas and New Mexico could slow the breakneck pace of growth until early 2019, analysts at Houston investment bank Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. wrote in another note Tuesday. Natural gas shipments also face constraints, they said. Enticed by a rebound in global oil prices, U.S. producers set a record this month, pumping 10.7 million barrels of oil a day.

Speculation is unnecessary. The book begins and ends with the response to Hurricane Katrina, because it stands as such a harrowing blueprint for disaster capitalism. At the time Katrina hit New Orleans, Pence was chairman of the powerful and highly ideological Republican Study Committee. Vehicles form a line at an Exxon gas station off of Interstate 55 in Jackson, Miss., Aug. 30, 2005. The station was one of the few in the city with both power and gas one day after Hurricane Katrina made landfall. Also notable is the determination to use any opportunity to strengthen the hand of the oil and gas industry. All these measures were announced by President George W. Bush within the week. Under pressure, Bush was eventually forced to reinstate the labor standards, though they were largely ignored by contractors. There is every reason to believe this will be the model for the multibillion-dollar infrastructure investments Trump is using to court the labor movement. Back in 2005, the Republican Study Committee meeting produced more ideas that gained presidential support. Climate scientists have directly linked the increased intensity of hurricanes to warming ocean temperatures. All these measures are a surefire way to drive up greenhouse gas emissions, the major human contributor to climate change, yet they were immediately championed by the president under the guise of responding to a devastating storm. So did a slew of well-connected contractors, who turned the Gulf Coast into a laboratory for privatized disaster response. Blackwater was hired to protect FEMA employees from looters. Parsons, infamous for its sloppy Iraq work, was brought in for a major bridge construction project in Mississippi. And no opportunity for profit was left untapped. Kenyon, a division of the mega funeral conglomerate Service Corporation International (a major Bush campaign donor), was hired to retrieve the dead from homes and streets. The work was extraordinarily slow, and bodies were left in the broiling sun for days. People wait for assistance after being rescued from their homes a day earlier in the Ninth Ward as a small fire burns after Hurricane Katrina, Aug. 31, 2005, in New Orleans. The camp construction fell behind schedule and was never completed. When the contractor was investigated, it emerged that the company, Lighthouse Disaster Relief, was actually a religious group. After all the layers of subcontractors had taken their cut, there was next to nothing left for the people doing the work. In Mississippi, a class-action lawsuit forced several companies to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in back wages to immigrant workers. Some were not paid at all. Most workers fled to avoid arrest. In the Katrina aftermath, the attacks on vulnerable people, carried out in the name of reconstruction and relief, did not stop there. Among the programs that were slashed were student loans, Medicaid, and food stamps. In other words, the poorest people in the United States subsidized the contractor bonanza twice: first, when Katrina relief morphed into unregulated corporate handouts, providing neither decent jobs nor functional public services; and, second, when the few programs that directly assist the unemployed and working poor nationwide were gutted to pay those bloated bills. Trump and Pence come to power at a time when these kinds of disasters, like the lethal tornadoes that just struck the southeastern United States, are coming fast and furious. Trump has already declared the U.S. a rolling disaster zone. And the shocks will keep getting bigger, thanks to the reckless policies that have already been promised. What Katrina tells us is that this administration will attempt to exploit each disaster for maximum gain.

PennEast Pipeline threatens N.J.'s environment The environment necessitates protection, as it is the primary determinant of survival. Forests remove carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the air, creating a clean atmosphere. Suitable climate conditions facilitate the growth of food. Earth is truly the only home that we have that can sustain life. Therefore, considering the immense life sustaining contributions the environment avails to human beings and other living things, the least we as a society can do is to save our environment. While the PennEast Pipeline would provide many temporary jobs, allowing workers to make thousands of dollars, this is only a short term economical benefit. The destruction to the environment would be permanent. The proposed route would cross 88 waterways, potentially releasing dangerous levels of arsenic and other harmful chemicals into the water used for drinking, cleaning, and bathing. In addition, millions of gallons of water would be pulled from the Delaware watershed. This pipeline would render 114 miles of land useless for agricultural, and destroy the habitats of endangered species. Aside from crossing some of the Mid-Atlantic's most popular recreation destinations such as Hickory Run State Park, Weiser State Forest, and the Sourland Mountains, homes from hundreds of families would be taken in the process. The effects extend far past the land itself, and into the lives of friends, families and neighbors. Saving the environment saves the future generation. We will not live forever. Therefore, we should leave the environment habitable and conserved in a way that our grandchildren and great grandchildren can appreciate it. We are blessed to enjoy the onset of sunrise and sunset, the beautiful beaches and forests, jungles, and wildlife. Making sacrifices today of preventing harm to the environment creates a brighter tomorrow. Believe in the people, believe in the future. Sections N.J. News Local News N.J.

Photo by Peg Hunter via Flickr Creative Commons. A Lakota prophecy tells of a mythic Black Snake that will move underground and bring destruction to the Earth. It does not take an over-active imagination to make a connection between these images and oil pipelines and spills. But to make matters worse, the nefarious reptile seems to suffer from leaky gut syndrome. Expanding pipeline maze Executive actions by Donald Trump just four days into his presidency practically guarantee expedited approval for DAPL, as well as for Keystone XL. This indicates, among other things, that the maze of oil and gas pipelines in the US will continue to expand at an unprecedented and reckless pace. The US is already home to about 2.5 million miles of underground gas and oil pipeline. For the sake of comparison, only one other country exceeds 100,000 pipeline miles: Russia, with 161,502 miles. Canada places third, with just over 62,000 miles of pipeline. All other countries fall far below that, with most containing fewer than 10,000 pipeline miles. More than 72,000 miles of the US conduits carry crude oil, and more than 20 pipelines directly threaten Native lands. Effectively opposing new pipelines and pipeline extensions will require the active participation of thousands, if not millions, of determined citizens. Water is necessary for the life of every person on the planet, and the seriousness of the situation compels every one of us to become involved to the greatest extent feasible. This monstrosity is an environmental disaster waiting to happen. The heroic water protectors at Standing Rock have achieved much, but now the ground they have gained must be fought for all over again. With the stroke of a poisonous presidential pen, Trump has already managed to betray both long-standing treaties and recent agreements, bringing dishonour and disgrace on the US government while jeopardising water supplies and planetary well-being. Significant battles There are a number of other significant pipeline battles that must be fought with the tenacity water protectors have shown at Standing Rock. These include challenges to the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), the Diamond Pipeline, the Atlantic Sunrise expansion to the Transco Pipeline, the Transmountain Pipeline expansion, the Bayou Bridge Pipeline, the Pilgrim Pipeline, the Trans-Pecos and Comanche Trail Pipelines, the Algonquin Incremental Pipeline, the Alberta Clipper pipeline expansion project, Northern Gateway Pipeline and more. It will travel along a route starting in north-western West Virginia and ending in southern Virginia, with a detour into Pennsylvania. The MVP would cross 377 bodies of water, the Appalachian Trail and the Blue Ridge Parkway, and could adversely affect thousands of acres of forest habitat. Along the way, the Diamond will cross the Arkansas River, the Illinois Bayou, the White River, St Francis River, and the Mississippi River. Diamond Pipeline One of the most disturbing aspects of the Diamond Pipeline is its point of origin. The title is proudly announced on signs placed at the entrances and exits to the town, which was once a part of the Sac and Fox reservations. The area surrounding Cushing has also recently become incredibly earthquake prone, thanks to the large number of waste-water injection wells. The US Geological Survey reported 825 earthquakes of a 1.5 magnitude or greater in the Cushing area between January 14, 2016 and January 14, 2017, with an alarming 5.8 record-setter in nearby Pawnee last September. Each of the planned, proposed, and under-construction pipelines listed above deserve strong opposition, as do the many other pipelines still in the planning and approval stages. They are dangerous, as evidenced by the number of leaks, spills, and explosions. In the six-year period between 2010 and last year, 4215 pipeline incidents occurred. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration reported that pipeline accidents between 2010 and 2015 were responsible for a total of 26.5 million lires of crude oil being leaked into surrounding soil and waterways. The as-yet-untallied quantities lost last year and so far this year will add significantly to that total. Many of the existing pipelines are old and poorly maintained, and for some reason, the newer pipelines are even more accident prone. Human error causes some of the pipeline accidents, while natural occurrences are responsible for others. In 2013, for example, lightning struck a pipeline in North Dakota, causing 3.2 million litres of crude oil to spill onto a nearby wheat field. One wonders what will happen when the ongoing swarm of fracking-related Oklahoma earthquakes damages the Cushing oil storage tanks or the pipelines connected to the facility. Oil pollutes the water and land, sickens and kills. Natural gas contributes to climate change, pollutes the air and explodes. Oil and gas pipelines create temporary jobs for a relative few and permanent jobs for a small handful. Individuals living near petrochemical plants contend with chronic respiratory illnesses and high rates of cancer. With so many clean, green energy sources ready to be put into place, there is no reason to allow the Lakota prophecy of the planet-destroying Black Snake to become a permanent and fatal reality. The turnaround will not happen easily. In fact, it will be quite a struggle. Greed is strong, and the oil corporations wield unreasonable power. Now they have even more friends in high places, including the one who may as well be referred to as the CEO of the USA. But the previous halting of Keystone XL and the temporary victory at Standing Rock have proven that it is indeed possible to make a difference with determination and solidarity. The frightening number of proposed pipelines and the likelihood that those pipelines will receive swift approval make it clear that the battle for Mother Earth is indeed a war.

The oil leak is on the west side of the inlet and is unrelated to the company's ongoing natural gas leak on the eastern side of the basin near Nikiski. What caused the impact is not known. The largest sheen was 10 feet by 12 feet, the state agency said. Two other sheens were about 3.5 feet by 22.5 feet. The size of the leak is unknown, Ryan said. The crude oil pipeline runs between the Anna and Bruce platforms. Production at the platforms was shut down Saturday to stop the flow of oil through the pipeline. The line is 75 feet underwater. That gas leak was discovered on Feb. 7, on an 8-inch pipeline running between an onshore facility and the A Platform built in the mid-1960s. Hilcorp has delayed repairs on that leaking gas line, saying it's too dangerous with sea ice choking the inlet. The company was hoping to send divers down next week to fix the gas leak, if the sea ice clears enough. A repair by divers also won't happen immediately for the oil leak. Hilcorp reported the leak to DEC at 12:05 p.m. today. The company is the dominant producer in Cook Inlet, after arriving in Alaska in 2011 and rapidly acquiring facilities, many of them old. The pig would act like a squeegee, with the goal of pushing the oil past the trouble spot and cutting off the leak site, said Ryan. The DEC and the U.S. Coast Guard will send personnel to the Anna Platform Sunday to monitor that effort, Ryan said. Cook Inlet Spill Response Inc., an oil spill response contractor, will also have vessels in the water, she said. An Incident Command Post is being established at CISPRI offices in Nikiski, the agency said. Bob Shavelson with watchdog group Cook Inletkeeper said potentially many thousand gallons of oil could have leaked into waters occupied by endangered Cook Inlet beluga whales, salmon and other animals.

Now 23 days into his presidency, Trump and his new administration have passed some controversial executive orders, but the one executive order that poses a real threat to human rights violation is the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Standing Rock Protest (Picture courtesy of Google Images) The Dakota Access Pipeline is a 1,172 mile long pipeline ranging 80 inches in diameter transferring crude oil from North Dakota to Patoka, Illinois. underneath Lake Oahe lies seven more pipelines, the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline will be the eight addition to an already vulnerable situation. Humanities negligence and destruction of water and the ecological eradication of species is the biggest catastrophic misfortune to occur in centuries. Humanity has not forgotten about the past oil spills, but instead chooses not to acknowledge or learn from these past catastrophic events, and so they are condemned to repeat it while, encroaching on our human rights.

Alaska Natives and commercial fisherman experience the brunt of the aftermath of the spill causing significant declines in local fisheries, which impacted their livelihood and economic well-being. According to the Journal of American Behavioral Science not only did the oil spill effect the community and residents of Cordova on a Macro-level, but it also had a significant impact to its residents on a micro-level. Residents of Cordova, Alaska felt significant disruptions to their daily routines, family life, work, their future, as well as serious mental health problems. Examples of stresses they felt includes: increase drug and alcohol use, domestic violence, chronic feelings of helplessness, betrayal, anger, elevated levels of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and adoption of avoidance coping strategies. Most of this feeling had also to do with the prolonged litigation. Deep Water Horizon Spill (Picture courtesy of Google Images) If the already vulnerable Lake Oahe becomes contaminated the people of Standing Rock will face the same psychological, social, and economic misfortunes as the residents of Cordova, Alaska and South Mobil County, Alabama.

Photo courtesy of The Canadian Press Previous story Former pipeline engineer and whistleblower Evan Vokes is calling for a public inquiry into the operations and engineering of all Canadian oil and gas companies after Husky Energy altered a report about its response to the Saskatchewan oil spill. Vokes, who blew the whistle on TransCanada in 2012, said Canadians deserve answers about why pipelines are leaking and blowing up, despite industry claims that its infrastructure is safe. He said an inquiry could help shed light on some of the mysteries, much like the recent public hearings in Quebec held to root out corruption in the construction industry. Calgary-based Husky Energy initially reported it had detected the pipeline leak that spilled around 1,572 barrels of oil into the North Saskatchewan River about 14 hours before responding to the disaster and informing provincial authorities. On Thursday, it submitted a new report saying it only discovered the leak about 30 minutes before it notified the provincial regulator. The spill has caused major economic and environmental damage, particularly for two central Saskatchewan towns, Prince Albert and North Battleford, that rely on the river for drinking water and are now scrambling to supply residents. It is also elevating public concern about other major pipeline proposals such as TransCanada's 4,600-kilometre Energy East project that would carry more than a million barrels of oil per day between Alberta and New Brunswick crossing several major waterways such as the Saint Lawrence and Ottawa Rivers. Pipeline perception Russ Girling, CEO of TransCanada, told The Canadian Press in an interview that he understands why the public is getting worried about pipelines. Vokes has long alleged that many energy companies are cutting corners on engineering rules, putting public safety at risk. The federal regulator, the National Energy Board (NEB) confirmed in 2014 that several of his allegations of violations at TransCanada were valid. Obviously someone is not telling the truth. Evan Vokes speaks to the CBC in a 2012 interview. Screenshot taken from CBC report. The department declined to comment further. Authorities have already identified several wildlife casualties from the Husky spill, including birds. He said in other recent pipeline catastrophes have shown that companies don't always respond to warning signs. He said the NEB has also offered to help Environment and Climate Change Canada with its investigation. Girling, the TransCanada CEO, said his company will be keen to learn from the Husky incident to improve pipeline safety. Subscribe Share this article.

'script', 'twitter-wjs'); May 10, 2017 Protest against the Dakota Access pipeline on March 10, 2017 in Washington, D.C. The contested pipeline is scheduled to begin moving oil on June 1, without an emergency response plan in place for the section of the line that skirts the Standing Rock reservation. The company won't be required to have emergency response cleanup equipment stored near the river crossing for another year, either. The lack of rigorous safety measures for the crude oil pipeline is raising concerns from lawyers and pipeline consultants for the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, whose protests and legal fight against the Dakota Access pipeline became a flashpoint for environmental justice and indigenous rights last year. Despite the prolonged resistance, the pipeline is scheduled to begin operating on June 1 after President Donald Trump issued an order expediting its approval. Dakota Access LLC, the company building the pipeline, is required by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) to submit a general emergency plan for the entire half-million-barrel-a-day project before oil shipments begin. But no deadline has been set for it to submit a more detailed plan for the controversial Missouri River crossing as required by the Army Corps of Engineers. Without a complete emergency response plan and no requirement to have response equipment in place for another year, a spill in the months ahead could cause tremendous environmental damage, pipeline safety experts say. asked Richard Kuprewicz, president of Accufacts Inc., a consulting firm that provides pipeline expertise for industry and other parties. Kuprewicz works with the tribe's lawyers reviewing documents. The information about Dakota Access's emergency plans came to light last month after a legal battle over their release. The pipeline company filed a motion in federal court to keep the documents sealed, claiming they contained security-sensitive information. The documents offer the first public details of how Dakota Access would respond to a spill into Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River and the tribe's primary source of drinking water. The pipeline crosses Lake Oahe half a mile upstream of the reservation. The plans were released as part of an ongoing lawsuit by the tribe against the company and the Army Corps, seeking a more thorough environmental analysis of the pipeline. In addition to the lack of plans and equipment, Kuprewicz and other pipeline safety specialists said they are concerned that the company has underestimated the time it would take to respond to a spill, and that it therefore has underestimated the volume of a worst-case scenario. Dakota Access has said its pipeline will be equipped with state-of-the art leak detection sensors that would easily detect spills. It claims it could spot a leak within 9 minutes and could shut down the leaking section of pipe within 12.9 minutes. Federal data has shown that leak detection systems do not provide as much protection as the public is led to believe. So far, Dakota Access has produced two drafts of a detailed emergency response plan for the Lake Oahe crossing. An August 2015 draft, unsealed by the judge last month, said any oil spilled into the river would be diverted to the reservation's shoreline. A revised draft from March 2016 said the oil would be diverted to the opposite shore. Dakota Access would not say if it plans to produce a final plan. Map in the 2015 draft Lake Oahe spill plan shows booms in the Missouri River diverting oil to the shore of the Standing Rock reservation. That document is so heavily redacted that it offers the public little information about Dakota Access's preparations for a spill. Even a Wind Farm Faced Tougher Spill Response Requirements The company is required to submit a final version of its general emergency response plan for the entire pipeline before operations begin. PHMSA officials would not say if it has been filed. The Army Corps did not set a deadline for the company to file the final version of the more detailed response plans for the Missouri River crossing as part of its granting of an easement. The U.S. Coast Guard, which regulates oil tankers and oil tanker loading facilities, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates oil refineries, require more detailed, site-specific emergency response plans than those required by PHMSA, said Paul Blackburn, a pipeline safety expert and attorney with Honor the Earth, a Native American environmental advocacy group. The sharpest contrast to the lax emergency response requirements for the oil pipeline perhaps are the oil spill response measures required for a small wind farm off Rhode Island that came online in December. The Block Island Wind Farm, the nation's first offshore wind farm, had to have a detailed, final oil spill response plan for the small amount of oil contained in each of the wind farm's five turbines. The turbines require small amounts of lubrication grease and oil to keep the turbine blades spinning and generators producing electricity. Mineral oil is also used to insulate an electrical transformer within each turbine. The company also had to demonstrate that it had spill response equipment in place before the project began sending electricity to the mainland via a subsea cable. Pipeline companies routinely claim they can detect and isolate a spill within minutes, but the reality is often much different, Kuprewicz said. Ten days later, it took Enbridge 17.5 hours to confirm a leak and shut down its 6B pipeline after oil began gushing from the pipeline into Michigan's Kalamazoo River. Approximately 1 million gallons of tar sands crude oil spilled during the leak, making it one of the worst inland spills in U.S. history. Prior to the spill, Enbridge's emergency response plan claimed it could detect a leak and shut down Line 6B in 8 minutes. That worst-case figure was redacted in the spill model for Lake Oahe that was released by the court. But Blackburn estimated that in just under 13 minutes, the pipeline would leak approximately 630,000-903,000 gallons of oil. His calculation was based on the pipeline's diameter, flow rate and distance between shut-off valves, data that is available in public documents, as well as similar calculations from pipeline companies Enbridge and TransCanada. The 1-million-gallon Kalamazoo spill required 157,000 feet of boom, 43 boats and 79 vacuum trucks to divert and clean up the oil during the peak of cleanup operations. Dakota Access LLC is planning for just 6,600 feet of boom, six boats and nine vacuum trucks for a worst-case spill in the Missouri River's Lake Oahe reservoir, according to the company's draft Lake Oahe spill response plan. PHMSA has said it reviews and approves oil spill response plans in accordance with federal laws, and the agency is not involved in reviewing or approving the detailed response plan for the Lake Oahe crossing. As Dakota Access readies to ship oil, the agency's assurances offer little comfort to the attorney representing the tribe. Hasselman asked. There is no equipment in place.

Gas and oil development, exploration and fracking operations are colliding more and more with subdivision and housing developments as the front range continues to grow. Voters in Broomfield on Tuesday approved by a 57 percent margin giving their government more authority over the industry. Industry forces said the ballot initiative in Broomfield was not in compliance with state law and was sure to invite costly litigation that taxpayers would have to pay. Even though the courts have ruled that state power to regulate the industry trumps local measures, local residents continue to push local elected officials for action at a time when oil and gas interests also have mobilized themselves politically. The night before voters went to the polls, the Lafayette City Council passed a six-month moratorium on oil and gas drilling to give time for the city to forge new regulations. Hours after Lafayette acted, industry-backed City Council candidates won elections in Greeley while an engineer who works for Noble Energy, the second-largest driller in the state, narrowly beat back a challenge to a council seat she holds in Thornton. One night after election night, controversy continued to erupt, this time in Adams County over plans for 26 wells near Silver Creek Elementary School in Thornton. Homeowners near that proposed well site asked Adams County commissioners to block the wells. All the skirmishing is coming in advance of a projected drilling boom across the Front Range that could last as long as 30 years. Many local government officials say they are trying to respond to angry residents who are jamming public meetings and demanding action. Industry forces have fought back, signaling they probably will take the Broomfield voter initiative and Lafayette moratorium to the courts, where oil and gas interests prevailed in the past. Last year, the Colorado Supreme Court struck down efforts by Fort Collins and Longmont to regulate the industry. Lower courts thwarted similar efforts by Boulder and Larimer counties. She said concerns have been enhanced by the fatal house explosion in Firestone in April that was linked to a severed natural gas pipeline. They point out that state regulators have adopted methane rules for drillers. Oil and gas advocates say leaving regulations up to local governments will crimp an industry they contend supports more than 230,000 jobs in Colorado. Jim Alexee, executive director of the Colorado Sierra Club, noted that his side prevailed despite being outspent tenfold in the fight in Broomfield.

Around 5 p.m. the families were cleared to return to their homes with a promise from Magellan they would be reimbursed for any costs they incurred during their evacuation. Spills like the one in Texas dominate the news whenever they happen, so pipelines often appear much more accident-prone than they are. Although mistakes are inexcusable, news reports have never mentioned how almost all the oil transported that day moved without incident. Lobbying groups for oil and gas routinely laud their safety records: 99.999 percent of oil is transported safely through pipelines. In 2013, the Association of Oil Pipelines reported that 8.3 billion barrels of crude oil were moved via pipeline. By contrast, pipelines result in 1.7 fatalities per year. These differences are simple to explain. Unlike highways, pipelines and rail are far away from people. When there are pipeline accidents, there are less likely to be casualties. Not only are pipelines less likely to harm others, they also help limit the environmental impact of spills. The average percentage of liquids recovered from pipeline spills from 1992 to 2011 was 40 percent. Because oil is a valuable commodity, spills are expensive and companies want to avoid them just as much as the most ardent environmentalists. The profit motive encourages companies to keep their operations safe and environmentally sound. No one was harmed and, even though people were evacuated from their homes, they safely returned later the same day. The company is also compensating those affected. Rightfully so. LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: Our Viewpoints page brings the latest commentaries to your feed. Red or blue, oversight of dangerous environmental issues like oil spills is likely to be one of the few agreed-upon roles for government. In fact, many of the responders on the scene of the spill were government officials. Government can help monitor and prevent these problems and provide recourse for those harmed in the event those responsible are less than forthright and proactive when individuals are hurt. Legal rules for transporting oil should ensure those harmed have powerful avenues for recourse and must mandate companies maintain safe and clean operations.

The project would install two 178 mile pipelines, connecting Albany, NY, and Linden, NJ, to transport Bakken crude oil and refined products. The proposal has raised major opposition from municipalities, community groups, and environmental organizations as the route would cross through environmentally sensitive areas critical for drinking water supply, including the NJ Highlands, and through densely populated communities, threatening public health and safety. The Coalition Against the Pilgrim Pipeline, which includes over 40 organizations, is urging concerned citizens to attend the meeting and learn more. While Pilgrim has been meeting behind closed doors with regulators, the public has virtually no information on this proposal. We deserve to know more as federal regulators report 280 significant pipeline incidents a year. The pipeline will cross through the New Jersey and New York Highlands regions. Of particular concern are potential impacts to the Ramapo River Watershed, which provides drinking water to Wayne, Mahwah, Ramsey, Oakland, Franklin Lakes, Allendale, Pompton Lakes and eight more towns in New York. In times of drought, surface water from the Ramapo River is pumped into the Wanaque Reservoir, which provides drinking water for nearly 3 million people. If an incident were to occur in this region it would be especially alarming as one gallon of oil can contaminate a million gallons of drinking water. The distance between shut off valves in oil pipelines is 20 to 30 miles, opening the potential for a significant amount of oil to enter watersheds. In the case of a leak from this pipeline, the impact to drinking water could affect millions of state residents. Also, once a right-of-way is established it may set a precedent for expansion in the future, further impacting our drinking water supply watersheds. asked Jo Sippie-Gora, Kinnelon resident and member of Kinnelon Conserves. Pipeline systems are more prone to leaks than other forms of oil transport. Old pipelines are more prone to leaks and explosions, and significant blasting would be required to trench through dense bedrock in the old pipeline right of way through the New Jersey Highlands. The federal agency charged with overseeing pipeline safety, the Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration, is underfunded and understaffed. PHMSA only has 135 inspectors to oversee 2.6 million miles of pipeline. The Pilgrim Pipeline would carry a particularly volatile form of oil produced in the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana. The oil is produced through hydraulic fracturing or fracking, resulting in significant environmental impacts. In February the Wall Street Journal compared oil from 86 locations around the world and found Bakken crude oil to be the most explosive. This type of oil is also highly corrosive, which could damage the pipeline during operations. Three pipeline companies, Enbridge, Tesoro, and True, won orders from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to reject oil with high hydrogen sulfide levels (Bakken crude) in their pipelines, however FERC did deny this request to a fourth pipeline operator, Trailblazer Pipeline Company. Therefore it is uncertain if Pilgrim can guarantee they will not transport this oil with high hydrogen sulfide levels in their pipeline. Municipal opposition to the project is growing. Earlier this month, Oakland passed a resolution opposing the project, joining Parsippany, Montville and Watchung. The communities are calling for a moratorium on surveying and project planning within their municipality and for a thorough environmental review to be conducted to assess the project's environmental impacts. This opposition is significant as New Jersey does not have a state level siting law for oil infrastructure so municipal zoning and ordinances should apply to the project. Municipal oversight is not pre-empted by federal regulations for oil pipelines as it is for natural gas lines. You're now signed up for local updates.

Trump signed a series of executive orders related to infrastructure and construction, the highest profile of which involved the pipeline project that if completed would carry more than one-fifth of the oil Canada exports to the U.S.. It also encourages U.S. federal regulatory agencies to respond the opposite way the Obama administration did: quickly, and favourably. TransCanada responded with an official statement thanking President Trump. READ MORE: Donald Trump supports pipeline, will review decision to stop construction But there was some confusion Tuesday. The promise of a quick approval appeared to contradict statements from Trump and his own spokesman, both of whom said Tuesday they would seek to negotiate a better Keystone deal for U.S. taxpayers. Keystone XL would carry more than one-fifth of the oil Canada exports to the United States, taking it to the already-built southern leg that connects with major refineries on the Gulf of Mexico. The amount of Canadian oil sent to the U.S. has increased more than 60 per cent since TransCanada Corp. first applied for a permit in 2008. Those exports have largely rolled into the U.S. on trains. In a 2015 interview, a leader of the anti-Keystone movement explained the long-term goal: sabotaging the oil industry. Bill McKibben of the group 350.org helped organize the first big national protest against the project, which had previously been a localized land-rights issue in Nebraska. The goal is to make it less efficient, less profitable to force a faster transition to clean energy.

But that company modified its route to reduce the possibility of environmental damage to a water source at the request of the ranch owners. Lorne Matalon MARFA, Texas - Opponents of a pipeline under construction in west Texas are pleased by the national attention garnered by the protest against the Dakota Access crude oil pipeline in North Dakota. Construction in North Dakota has been temporarily halted following months of protest. But many people in west Texas are frustrated that it has taken a recent ruling by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers halting the work in North Dakota to bring national attention to the Trans-Pecos Pipeline in Texas. In North Dakota, the Standing Rock Sioux and other Native Americans and their allies attracted widespread attention from both the national media and from Wall Street. The Sioux's reservation is near Dakota Access. They said the pipeline could threaten their water. Months of protests and rallies have for now translated into a megaproject stopped as it is relatively close to completion. Coincidentally, a Dec. 13 pipeline leak spilled significant amounts of oil into a creek approximately 150 miles from the Dakota Access protest encampment at Cannon Ball, North Dakota. The spill is the kind of development that opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline point to as an example of the kind of accident they fear. Both the Dakota Access and Trans-Pecos pipelines are being built by a consortium led by Energy Transfer Partners of Dallas. The company recently announced a merger with Sunoco Logistics. Both companies are controlled by general partner Energy Transfer Equity. President-elect Donald Trump has nominated former Texas Gov. Rick Perry to be the new Secretary of Energy. Perry is a member of the Board of Directors of Energy Transfer Partners. In North Dakota, the Army Corps of Engineers ruling has been welcomed by opponents of the Trans-Pecos Pipeline in the Big Bend of Texas, so named for the arc the Rio Grande traverses in the borderlands where the high desert cascades down to the river. The Trans-Pecos Pipeline has been paid for by Mexico. The route, the most direct and therefore least costly path from the natural gas laden Permian Basin of Texas to the border, was selected by Mexico. It was then approved by the State of Texas. Mexico said it needs the natural gas to power electricity plants. But their outcry never reached the critical mass it did in North Dakota. That may be changing. Near Marfa, Texas in the high Chihuahuan Desert, rancher Jeanne Simpson's land, in her family's custody since the 1800s, is now a construction site. Energy Transfer seized her land using the power of Eminent Domain, which Texas gave to the company. To date, Simpson and numerous others have not received compensation owed them under Eminent Domain law in Texas. Simpson is one in a group of landowners that was the target of legal action by Energy Transfer Partners Trans-Pecos Pipeline, LLC. In 2016, six landowners won a series of awards totaling in millions of dollars, given after the pipeline company sued the landowners. A seventh case was adjudicated in favor of the company. The landowners are part of a larger group of approximately 40 people or landholding entities contesting compensation offers and who have retained legal counsel. Energy Transfer Partners Trans-Pecos Pipeline LLC said in an emailed response that it is appealing the verdicts against it. In the same email exchange, the company said that it has offered fair compensation to landowners. However, landowners and others interviewed for this story claim otherwise. Simpson said the North Dakota ruling is welcome here. Since the Dakota ruling, Native Americans in Texas and their non-Native allies have gathered multiple time at the perimeters of the Trans-Pecos Pipeline. Energy Transfer has said it respects the right to peaceful protest. Speaking of preservation, Land here includes some of the last legacy ranch land in the United States. He is with the Big Bend Conservation Alliance, a group of landowners, ranchers and area residents. Both pipeline controversies are also on the radar in Mexico. Pipelines bringing in U.S. natural gas are lynch pins of the country's energy reform program, a plan that proposes cleaner electricity generation through the use of natural gas rather than oil, a more stable supply of electricity and lower prices for businesses, manufacturers and consumers. The price and delivery of electricity are particularly irksome issues In Mexico. In 2017, four U.S. natural gas pipelines will begin delivering to Mexico. In the next three years, U.S. pipeline capacity into Mexico will nearly double. He did not comment specifically on any individual pipeline. But he said Mexico is counting on timely delivery of U.S. natural gas. Mexico appears nervous about the election of Donald Trump. But on this issue, the Mexican energy establishment is with him. The President-elect said once in office, the standoff in North Dakota will be resolved quickly. However, several people interviewed for this story suggest they are not deterred and feel emboldened by developments in North Dakota. They said they will try at the very least to keep their opposition to the Trans-Pecos Pipeline in the public eye.

The pipeline, which inspired months of protest and heavy-handed tactics from police in North Dakota, was delayed in December but fast-tracked when President Trump took office. It is expected to be operational within a month. In March, independent news organization MuckRock filed a Freedom of Information Act request to gain access to the environmental assessment the Corps had conducted to determine the effects an oil spill could have on Lake Oahe. MuckRock published the letter Tuesday. Rather than censoring certain parts of the report, the government chose to withhold the entire document. In citing vague dangers to the public, the Army Corps of Engineers is employing a common argument used by government agencies to justify withholding information from the public. Further, Morisy and MuckRock claim the Corps was skirting accountability and treating the outlet unfairly even before they issued their denial letter. The pipeline is scheduled to be operational as soon as next month, which is all the more concerning considering the numerous oil spills that have continued to occur in recent months. One of those spills came from a pipeline owned by Energy Transfer Partners, the same company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline.

From 1979-1981, Sami and Norwegian protests attempted to stop the construction of the Alta Dam in Norway. North Dakotan authorities want a pipeline because it will supposedly make shipping oil out of the state safer. Since June 2012, more Bakken crude has been moved by rail than by pipeline due to a surge in production and resulting pipeline congestion. If the pipeline is not completed on time, rates will have to be renegotiated and DAPL may no longer be such a lucrative project. And in the North American Arctic and the Lower 48, land is one thing that been guaranteed to many indigenous peoples through land claims agreements and settlements. The boundaries of Standing Rock were delineated in 1889 by the Dawes Act, a policy that had devastating consequences nationwide for Native Americans due to its attempt to break up the tribal system of societal organization. But it did guarantee them their rights to the land. To be fair, these projects often give jobs to native people. But they can also wreak havoc on their environment and precious resources even though they do not directly cut through their land. Pipelines placed anywhere near a water source are risky. Pipelines seem like quiet and sturdy infrastructures, but the protests in North Dakota are attempting to show that if one thing goes wrong, an entire way of life could be jeopardized. 2. The proliferation of fossil fuel infrastructure If built, DAPL will perpetuate the spread of fossil fuel infrastructure across North America. But if there were an issue in the Arctic like DAPL that attracted the interests of both indigenous and environmental activists, it could be a lightning rod for global dissidents to come and support the movement. The events in North Dakota show that not all locals are happy about out-of-state and foreign activists coming to ally themselves with the cause. If a protest were to arise in the Arctic, it would generally be less feasible for allies and supporters of the movement to travel to the site given the sheer costs of getting up north. If DAPL is built, it will help secure and encourage the continued projection of oil from the Bakken formation. Both Bakken and Athabasca are high-latitude oil fields whose emissions can exacerbate Arctic warming. Many of the pollutants they release into the atmosphere come from the wasteful practice of gas flaring, which is done to get rid of excess oil that cannot be economically shipped to market. The bright lights of gas flares can even be seen from space. Deepwater oil in the Gulf of Mexico is also considered unconventional, as is Arctic oil. Since at least 2008, North American Arctic oil, especially in Canada where there is even less infrastructure to get product out to market than in Alaska, has been on the back burner. This is partly due to the glut created by the Bakken boom, which has made Arctic oil impossible to profitably extract. From North Dakota to the Arctic The plains of North Dakota may seem a long way away from the Arctic Ocean. Ultimately, it may be the longer staying power of the movement in North Dakota, which is centrally located within the U.S., reachable by car, and, while cold, not insanely so in winter, which allows the NoDAPL protests to succeed. In the Arctic, similar movements might eventually have to come in from the cold. This post first appeared on Cryopolitics, an Arctic News and Analysis blog.

The potential for a pipeline leak that might taint drinking water is at the core of the months-long standoff at the Dakota Access pipeline, where thousands of people have been protesting against its construction. That pipeline would cross the Missouri river. A landowner discovered the spill near Belfield on 5 December, according to Bill Suess, an environmental scientist with the North Dakota health department. Suess said the spill migrated about six miles from the spill site along Ash Coulee creek, and it fouled an unknown amount of private and US Forest Service land along the waterway. The creek feeds into the Little Missouri river, but Seuss said it appears no oil got that far and that no drinking water sources were threatened. He said about 37,000 gallons of oil had been recovered as of Monday. Owen said the pipeline was shut down immediately after the leak was discovered. True Cos has a history of oil field-related spills in North Dakota and Montana, including a January 2015 pipeline break into the Yellowstone River. The six-inch steel Belle Fourche pipeline is mostly underground but was built above ground where it crosses Ash Coulee creek, Suess said. Owen said the pipeline was built in the 1980s and is used to gather oil from nearby oil wells to a collection point. About 60 workers were on site Monday, and crews have been averaging about 100 yards daily in their cleanup efforts, he said. Some of the oil remains trapped beneath the frozen creek.

Since 2006, the companies have reported 36 spills totaling 320,000 gallons of petroleum products, most of which was never recovered. Federal pipeline safety regulators initiated 19 enforcement activities against the three True pipeline companies since 2004. Dallas-based pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners says the Dakota Access pipeline would include safeguards such as leak detection equipment and that workers monitoring the pipeline remotely in Texas could close valves within three minutes if a breach were detected.

The pipeline, running from the oil sands of Alberta to a port in the Pacific province of British Columbia, would allow Canadian crude to gain greater access to foreign markets and higher prices. Kinder Morgan Canada gave Ottawa until May 31 to come up with reassurances it could press ahead with plans to more than double the capacity of the existing pipeline amid efforts by British Columbia to block construction. The company also faced opposition from environmentalists and aboriginal groups who worried about the pipeline spilling its tar-like heavy oil. The federal government can in theory step in and disallow any provincial laws that British Columbia might use to block the pipeline, but this provision in the Canadian constitution has not been used since the 1940s. Ottawa could also deploy the police and troops to maintain a barrier between protesters and construction workers. It does not intend to own the project for long. Kinder Morgan Canada shares initially jumped as much as 8.5 percent before ending down 3 percent, while the broader Canada share index fell 0.6 percent. The government will also offer federal loan guarantees to ensure construction of the expansion continues through the 2018 season as part of the deal with the company, a unit of Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N). Morneau sidestepped questions about how Ottawa will deal with opposition from environmentalists and aboriginal groups, who cite the risk of a catastrophic spill. Morneau said more spending would be needed to complete the expansion, but gave no precise financial details, and stressed he felt the project should be returned to the private sector. Kinder Morgan Canada will continue to own the remaining assets, including crude storage, rail terminals and a condensate pipeline, and look to expand. The fact the federal government needed to buy Trans Mountain to ensure the project goes ahead does not bode well for the industry, said Chris Bloomer, CEO of the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association. Trans Mountain stirred an unusual public fight between neighboring provinces. The contribution will convert into equity in the pipeline. British Columbia Premier John Horgan said the province would push ahead with a court case to establish its right to restrict increased shipments of crude oil to its coastal waters.

Outside of the environmental and tribal concerns, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said there were concerns about the economic risks for the project. According to the IEEFA, if the pipeline isn't completed by Jan. 1, the project consortium may have to revisit some of the contracts for shipping oil through the 1,110-mile pipeline. The institute said further that crude oil prices being about 50 percent lower than they were at the height of the U.S. shale era means the regional economic prospects are far from certain.

The company in its latest quarterly results said most of its existing pipeline networks were oversubscribed. The Dakota Access pipeline could carry as much as half of what North Dakota produces and the pipeline consortium said that would reduce shipment by rail, which carries its own risks.

The changes, later criticized by scientists for lacking evidence, played down the risk of pollution that can result from the well-drilling technique known as fracking. Earlier draft versions emphasized more directly that fracking has contaminated drinking water in some places. The documents also show that the news release accompanying the scientific study was changed on June 3, 2015, the day before it was made public. In fact, scientists had found evidence in some places that fracking activity had polluted drinking water supplies. In all, the agency identified more than two dozen instances in which hydraulic fracturing had an impact on water resources. The agency also identified hundreds of other spills, many of which reached soil and water. Industry representatives cheered the findings, touting them as validation that fracking is safe. Media organizations big and small highlighted the conclusion in headlines and sound bites. In a 140-character information ecosystem, suddenly the industry had the benefit of government assurance that fracked wells did not pose a significant threat to water supplies. Those reports won the day, dominating the news cycle despite the EPA report noting that fracking activities, including chemical spills and faulty well construction, did have an impact on drinking water resources. When research is mischaracterized by policy-makers, however, it raises concerns about the politicization of government science. The oil and gas industry, along with Republican allies in Congress, has regularly criticized the EPA for investigations into fracking, arguing that state regulators have primary responsibility over the oil and gas sector. Even as it was conducting the broad study, in three instances the EPA withdrew abruptly from investigations into landowner complaints over water contamination related to fracking. The revelations come as Republican President-elect Donald Trump is set to take office on a pledge to abolish the EPA and eliminate regulations on oil and gas activities to boost energy exploration. It might be difficult for Trump to eliminate the agency, but even slight reductions could have a major effect on an agency that already has been hit by budget cuts. Areas where hydraulic fracturing is being used to extract oil or natural gas. There are also 1,902 fewer EPA employees than in 2010. Congress called for study The oil and gas industry has used hydraulic fracturing for decades. The process sends a mix of water, chemicals and sand into the subsurface at high pressure. In the past 20 years, its use has dramatically increased as technology has combined with horizontal drilling techniques to produce vast amounts of affordable fossil energy from shale rock formations. Gas, thought to have fewer greenhouse-gas emissions than coal, has been replacing coal steadily for U.S. electricity generation for more than a decade. As natural gas production has grown over that decade, the portion that is coming from fracked wells has grown to two-thirds. Natural gas is also seen by many, including the Obama administration, as a cleaner-than-coal bridge to a time when most electricity will come from renewable sources. In addition to making the U.S. less dependent on foreign sources of oil and natural gas, fracking has delivered an economic boost to many parts of the country. But like many industries relying on natural resources, the prospect of jobs has collided with environmentalists and residents worried about clean air and clean water. Landowners in many states, including Texas, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Alabama and Wyoming, have complained that their drinking water was contaminated after fracking activity occurred near them. Supporters of the congressional action cited a 2004 EPA study that said fracking was safe; they claimed the study politicized the science and played down negative findings. So EPA scientists spent years evaluating scientific reports from academics, industry, non-governmental organizations and government agencies. They took their own water samples, conducted laboratory analysis, did computer modeling of potential contamination, interviewed residents reporting water quality changes and negotiated with oil and gas companies to acquire proprietary well drilling data. The study was highly anticipated and in the months before its release in June 2015, a draft assessment was shared with top policymaking and public information officials, according to internal emails. A gas well pad in Dimock, PA. - Amanda Hrycyna for APM Reports Meetings involved White House advisers Candace Vahlsing and Dan Utech and officials from the Energy and Interior departments. Vahlsing and Utech declined to comment, a White House spokesman said. The findings included a 2010 chemical spill in Kentucky that killed threatened fish, a well blowout in North Dakota that resulted in chemicals potentially reaching a nearby aquifer and direct drilling into drinking water resources in Wyoming. The report concluded that 9.4 million people lived within a mile of a hydraulically fractured well between 2000 and 2013. The agency also reported 457 spills related to fracking in 11 states between 2006 and 2012. In 324 of those cases, the EPA said spills reached soil, surface water or ground water. A spreadsheet of those spills was included in the study. On the day of the release, when asked to quantify the risks of fracking, Burke demurred. The examples of documented contamination were overshadowed by the last-minute changes that shifted the tenor of the report. Some experts in hydraulic fracturing say the late edit exonerated the practice in the public eye. The agency had earlier abandoned its research into problems at Pavillion and turned the investigation over to the state. It was one of the three instances in which the EPA withdrew from investigating suspected contamination incidents in the past four years. The others were in Dimock, Pa., and Parker County, Texas. The agency did not include water testing data from those cases in its national study on drinking water. Near Dimock, Pa. - Amanda Hrycyna for APM Reports Study took pressure off industry McCarthy, the head of the EPA, said at the National Press Club last week that the agency will soon release the final study. During her remarks, McCarthy noted that the four board members with oil and gas ties dissented from the criticism of the phrase. The EPA has the authority to manage drinking water impacts to water resources and to oversee drinking water impacts through several federal laws, including the Clean Water Act and the Safe Water Drinking Act. But states largely oversee oil and gas development. The industry, heavily invested in continuing the practice, has steadily battled the EPA. The companies and their industry groups have also repeatedly said there have been no confirmed cases of groundwater contamination from hydraulic fracturing. If the study had emphasized major problems with the practice, it could have meant increased oversight by state regulators, a call for banning fracking in certain communities and even calls for additional federal oversight. Instead, the draft study took pressure off the industry. Nowhere did the draft state that there was no widespread, systemic impact on water. A version circulated internally in early June featured a headline emphasizing vulnerabilities to drinking water. Within a day, the Marcellus Shale Coalition from Pennsylvania put together a collection of TV news reports, all emphasizing the lack of impact and largely ignoring the vulnerabilities. Industry has battled EPA Today the oil and gas industry continues to use the study to advance drilling around the world. The Maryland Petroleum Council is highlighting the research as it pushes to allow fracking in that state. And earlier this month, the American Petroleum Institute, a lobbying group, urged the EPA to keep the language in the study. The American Petroleum Institute released its own industry-backed study confirming that hydraulic fracturing has led to no widespread, systemic impact to drinking water. Board member Thomas Young, a professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California-Davis, said he believes the phrase is misleading because the federal agency may not have found a widespread impact, but impacts could still be occurring. Young said he was unaware that the EPA had made last-minute changes to the study or the news release. He said he would have chosen different wording but understood the push to put a conclusion on a multiyear study that cost millions. Congress, the oil and gas industry and environmental groups would not have settled for a report simply calling for additional research, Young said. The study ran into a number of difficulties when it began five years ago. The EPA, for example, tried to work with oil and gas companies to conduct testing on sites before, during and after a fractured well is drilled. Despite pledges of cooperation from the industry, the EPA could never reach agreement with any company to conduct the tests. Puls said he left his position at the EPA in 2011 partly because he was frustrated with resistance by oil and gas companies to work with the EPA on the study. Many landowners who believe their water was harmed by hydraulic fracturing say the EPA let them down by minimizing the impact. Bill Ely is one of several dozen landowners in Dimock who noticed water was changing color once drilling started in their community in 2009. - Amanda Hrycyna for APM Reports A spokesman for Cabot did not return messages. Company officials have said that any problems with the water in Dimock occurred long before the company drilled in the area. Ely is one of several dozen landowners in Dimock who noticed water was changing color once drilling started in their community in 2009. The complaints from landowners placed Dimock at the center of the fight over the environmental safety of fracking. Movie stars and environmentalists visited the small, northeastern Pennsylvania town and called for the practice to be banned. Industry groups countered with analysis that the practice is safe and brings money and jobs to an economically depressed area. Since the first incident occurred in 2009, state and federal regulators became heavily involved in Dimock. More than a dozen other families settled with the company for an undisclosed sum. Cabot has not disclosed terms of its settlement with landowners. Attorneys for Cabot said in court that the methane leaking from the wells was occurring naturally and was a problem before the company drilled in the area. In 2012, the EPA conducted a study of private water wells of 64 homes in Dimock. But another federal agency, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, looked at the same data and concluded in June 2016 that chemicals in the water wells in 27 of the 64 homes were high enough to affect human health. Some landowners are still pushing for the government to do more. Every few weeks, Ray Kemble, who said he has one of those 27 homes, has to fill two 325-gallon tanks with water. The tanks, which sit in a shed outside his home, ensure he has clean water. His property, which sits across the street from a well pad, is covered with anti-fracking signs. Ray Kemble has to fill two 325-gallon tanks with water every few weeks to ensure he has a constant supply of clean water. His home is one of the 27 in Dimock that have a high concentration of harmful chemicals in their water wells. Drilling provides economic boost Though some landowners in the Dimock area are unhappy with fracking in the community, it has provided an economic boost. Cabot trucks can be seen regularly throughout the rural community and the company has a new corporate office in nearby Montrose. Cabot is among many companies to tap into the energy rich Marcellus Shale Formation that lies under parts of New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. Landowners are paid monthly, and drilling has increased employment in rural parts of the country. Jobs in the oil and gas extraction sector grew nationally by 33,600 between 2006 and 2016, government figures show. Bill Aileo, a homeowner in Dimock, said the natural gas boom has helped the community. He acknowledges that the fracking process, along with transporting and storing oil and gas, could release methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. The outgoing administration this month issued rules to prevent methane leaks on federal lands. Last Monday, Trump issued a video statement saying that energy issues, including fracking, will be a top priority when he takes office. Trump has appointed Myron Ebell, a climate change skeptic, to lead the transition at the EPA. The president-elect also has pledged to further deregulate the oil and gas industry, but his position on fracking has been contradictory. In September, he vowed to expand natural gas production from fracking and coal production, two competing energy resources. The disagreement over the environmental impact of fracking will continue in the Trump administration. The study is focused on an area that includes Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio. They have grown suspicious about how the EPA handles fracking issues. It has been corrected.

Whilst these build-ups can become serious enough to cause complete failure of the oil recovery system, fortunately paraffin wax fouling can be relatively easy to remove. Oil wells that suffer from wax problems are, in fact, usually experiencing other fouling as well. Almost any heavy organic deposit encountered in oil extraction is referred to as paraffin or wax. While paraffins are usually the major component in these deposits, it is most often actually a mixture of paraffins and asphaltenes. That is why it is important that any solvent used to remove these deposits is effective at removing more than just paraffin. Many chemical treatments for paraffin in use today require heat in order to be most effective. The application of heat into the system requires additional equipment, energy usage and expense so it is preferable to find a solvent effective at low temperatures. The final and most important consideration when selecting the best paraffin removal chemical is safety. Many chemical treatments require the use of caustic reagents which are hazardous to workers and can damage equipment. Many solvent based treatments contain toxic chemicals which increase risks to human health and the environment.

Share Tweet LinkedIn Email Print The increasingly brutal police response to protests over the construction of The Dakota Access Pipeline has pushed the debate over the safety of oil infrastructure into the national spotlight. Oil industry supporters argue that pipelines are safer alternative to hauling fuel by tanker trucks or freight trains. He cites an environmental impact statement conducted by the U.S. State Department comparing the impact of rail delivery of crude oil to that of the proposed Keystone XL pipeline. Additionally, a 2013 study from the conservative Manhattan Institute found that road transportation had an annual accident rate of 19.95 incidents per billion ton miles and rail transportation had 2.08 incidents per billion ton miles, compared to 0.89 incidents per billion ton miles for natural gas transmission and 0.58 serious incidents per billion ton miles for hazardous liquid pipelines. Environmentalists, however, point to a lack of adequate state and federal regulation and the difficulties of maintaining millions of miles of aging pipeline infrastructure in their warnings about the dangers of spills, fires, and other accidents. And data from the federal government suggests such concerns should be taken seriously. Over the last thirty years, just under 9,000 significant pipeline-related incidents have taken place nationwide, according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. To better understand the extent of this damage, CityLab mapped out all significant pipeline accidents between 1986 and 2016, based on data compiled by Richard Stover, an environmental advocate and former research astronomer at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In the map above, you can see the locations of all significant oil and gas pipeline incidents since 1986 in which the federal government provided location data. (Note: In incident cases without longitude and latitude information in the federal data, Stover geolocated incidents based on their county data. The incidents are sized bigger and shaded darker as the financial damage associated with each incident increases. Zoom in on the map to get a more fine-grained view of the incident clustering and click on individuals dots to see specifics about related fatalities, injuries, and financial costs. Stover points out the locations reflect the footprint of oil and gas pipeline distribution networks nationwide, suggesting that wherever pipelines are extended, deadly accidents will follow. Incidents are particularly common, for example, in Texas and Louisiana, where numerous lines carry oil and gas, extracted on- and off-shore, to serve the rest of the country. People are killed. To illustrate other dimensions of this damage, we created time lapse maps to show the accumulation of fatalities and injuries associated with pipeline incidents. Below is a time lapse map of fatalities resulting from pipeline incidents between 1986 and 2016. Red dots indicate incidents that resulted in fatalities and black dots indicate incidents without fatalities that could be geolocated. The map below illustrates significant incidents that resulted in injuries (in yellow) that could be geolocated. Such incidents accounted for 1,438 of all 9,006 pipeline-related accidents. As the time lapse shows, significant pipeline-related incidents have picked up in recent years in certain states. Anti-pipeline activist Isabella Zizi, a member of the Northern Cheyenne, Arikara, and Muskogee Creek tribes, is an organizer with Idle No More SF Bay, which has been leading a national call to divest from financial institutions funding the Dakota Access Pipeline. The 1,172 mile Dakota Access Pipeline, stretching from North Dakota to Illinois, would carry 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day if completed. But its future is still uncertain. In recent weeks, police have used increasingly aggressive means to confront protesters, including water cannons, tear-gas grenades, and sound weapons. Regardless of what happens at Standing Rock, Zizi says he expects deadly pipeline accidents will continue to flare up nationwide. But this is contaminating our land, our soil, our air, our water.

The state also needs to cut spending and do a better job of forecasting tax revenue from the oil and gas industry, which has been battered by the drop in prices, Gov. Doug Burgum (R) said yesterday in his first address to the Legislature in Bismarck. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the Army Corps of Engineers over the Dakota Access pipeline in July, saying the project's Missouri River crossing could endanger the water supply on the tribe's reservation and damage cultural sites on surrounding private land. Thousands of people flocked to join protests that the tribe led in Cannon Ball, N.D. Advertisement The protests were largely peaceful, but hundreds of people were arrested for trespassing and other charges, and police broke up some marches with rubber bullets, tear gas and fire hoses. Construction on the pipeline was halted, at least temporarily, when the Obama administration said it would review the way the Army Corps consults with Native American tribes about pipeline routes (Energywire, Dec. 4, 2016). Burgum, a former software executive and venture capitalist, won election in November after the incumbent governor, Jack Dalrymple, opted not to run again. He'll be working with a Legislature that has turned more conservative, with Republicans widening their margins in both chambers (Energywire, Nov. 7, 2016). The state's budget will be one of Burgum's other main challenges. The oil bust that started in 2014 cut into the state's sales tax and other revenue, leaving it 25 percent short of its forecast for the current two-year budget cycle. North Dakota already is projecting another general fund shortfall of about 20 percent for the biennium that starts in July. Dalrymple has proposed a budget that would offset the shortfall by cutting spending at most state agencies; Burgum said he'll offer amendments to Dalrymple's plan in the next few weeks. Over the long run, he said, North Dakota needs to reorganize its government from the bottom up. Towns and cities can become more efficient by building smaller, denser communities that require less infrastructure, and the state can reduce spending by merging departments and eliminating overlapping functions. Burgum also said the state needs better information about oil prices in the future. A lot of farmers and agribusinesses have adopted technology to predict the price of crops, he said. pipelines Related Headlines PIPELINES FERC restarts Atlantic Coast project Energywire: Tuesday, September 18, 2018 PIPELINES N.Y. project backer heads back to court Energywire: Tuesday, September 18, 2018 PIPELINES Warren, Markey press company, regulators on Mass. blasts E&E Daily: Tuesday, September 18, 2018 PIPELINES NTSB homes in on cause of deadly Mass.

You got it. Hypocrisy knows no bounds. jrkrideau says 4 December 2016 at 7:38 pm Congratulations to all those people defending the land at Standing Rock. Regulations, like the FDA cGMP, are the equivalent of Federal Laws, and can only be overturned if they follow the protocol in the USC. Which requires, per USC, public hearings, time for responses, etc. Takes months, if not years to greatly change it. What is Science, it works. Silver Fox says 4 December 2016 at 8:05 pm The original planned route for the pipeline was through Bismarck, a mostly white city, but it was deemed too dangerous so they decided to run it through Indian Country instead. They should go back to the original plan and see how those good, upstanding Republican voters think about that. Oh, and lets not forget the dogs, the truncheons, the rubber bullets, the gas. I can already hear the outrage on Fox News. Maybe build some new ones for Flint and countless other cities that need them. A Government, dealing with a huge project such as this, sometimes has to choose between a rock and a hard place (no pun intended) when making decisions. Real life sucks sometimes, deal with it. I am not deliberately being a dick, just pointing out reality. We are still an oil-based country in the US, so horrible choices will need to be made. yes you are.

I am not deliberately being a dick, just pointing out reality. We are still an oil-based country in the US, so horrible choices will need to be made. absolutely agree with that. The problem is that is not what we they were attempting to do here. What they were doing here was finding the cheapest way to do it like always, cost the least and make the most money. Very few were involved in this for the greater good of society they were in for the sole motive of making the most money they could by delivering a valuable commodity to customers who will pay top dollar for it. They can get off the pedestal now and take the flag off their shoulders. Cheap is not the be all and end all if they can not build and operator a pipe lines that meets proper safety standards and make a profit that is tough. if they can not make money from the oil business without what is increasingly clear are unacceptable pollution levels and compliance is impossible that also is tough. Water Protectors, please. Not protestors. SC (Salty Current) says 4 December 2016 at 9:45 pm Apologies.

What you linked was not science. Some highlights: From 1990 through 2012, 17 605 pipeline incidents were reported to the oil and gas regulator in Alberta at the time. 2012 saw 550 leaks and 17 ruptures, of which, 463 released hydrocarbon liquid or gas. The report brags that pipeline failures are down to a new low of 1.5 incidents per 1000km of pipeline, but the vast majority of the gains were from more reliable water pipelines which pose limited environmental risk when they leak or rupture. Go look it up and educate yourself. As of that date we became a net EXPORTER of petroleum products. At no time has any sane policy ever formally depended on tax base status. The actual taxpaying residents within Yellowstone or Grand Tetons or wherever are NEVER part of the decision process. Stop being a dick. This pipeline is a profit generation device that should never have been considered on merit. ESPECIALLY when it was relocated away from Bismarck. Stop being a dick and start learning stuff. Stop being part of dozens of millions of dicks who think crap that is false. Title sounded good. Title sounded good. Title sounded good. You did bad. Acknowledge your wrong, and learn from it. Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 5 December 2016 at 12:17 am And Miles, try this about pipelines versus other modes of transport. Fortune Magazine, hardly a bastion of green politics, talks about the potential problems. In 2010, a pipeline owned by Enbridge leaked 843,444 gallons of crude oil into wetlands around the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. The environmentalist Polaris Institute found that, according to Enbridge data, that company experienced 804 spills and released 5 million gallons of oil between 1999 and 2010. This spill is meaningful to me, since it occurred upstream from where I grew up in Battle Creek, MI, where it flows through the city from east to west. The Kalamazoo River flows west from Battle Creek, past Kalamazoo, and through south west Michigan, which has a lot of fruit orchards and grape vineyards. A large scale problem not just localized to a small area. The Wall Street Journal shows certain advantages to rail. PROS: Trains tend to spill a smaller amount of oil than other forms of transport. Rail transport can be speedier, too. It takes about five to seven days to move oil by train from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast or Atlantic Coast, the CRS says, versus about 40 days by pipeline. CONS: Rail accidents potentially threaten lives and can cause widespread property damage. As I recall from an oil and gas law symposium I attended, it is standard practice to have double-walled pipes reinforced with concrete. When I tried to leave messages at the North Dakota messaging service, the line was busy nine times out of 10. I hope the community up there will stay the course and not leave the camp quite yet. Avoid cities and head through sparsely populated areas. Sorry if that upsets the ghosts of a few religious lunatics. Ill maintained and supervised pipelines are, lousily designed pipelines add to the potential for disaster on an ill maintained, ill supervised pipeline. We had more pipelines than I can count in the area I grew up in, with leaks few and far between. Bankruptcy, forbidden. We do need to get a major fuel used for everything from lubricating machinery through fueling the literal engines of commerce, we do need to find superior alternatives as well. I prefer peace, but not at all costs, I long ago ran out of cheeks. Which only adds to my respect for you. I managed to not retch, but did get him off of the property and summon both EMS and law enforcement, who sent him to a good mental health care facility. Headed to bed now. the attitude that seems to be applied in these questions is it is about survival to build this pipe line. It is about the oil business it is the one that is fighting for survival they can see the righting on the wall it is going to change and the longer we struggle to keep oil cheap at all costs the longer it will take to the alternative to take over. It does nothing for us the citizens it just puts money in the pockets of the already rich oil business. These decisions are not long term decisions made with the success and prosperity of the country in mind they are short term decisions made at the behest and in favor to the oil business which will reap the profits. When oil finally goes away as our primary energy source because it is absofuckinglutely a finite source we can buy the new stuff from other countries who do not fancy putting all their eggs in one basket and are not controlled by the oil business. Rowan vet-tech says 5 December 2016 at 1:44 am Miles. Please stop showing us your asshole. Tethys says 5 December 2016 at 2:27 am I think a route well away from the river valley (and the water source for many ND people and others downstream) is far preferable to the stupidity of running it under the Missouri. The risk of destroying an entire watershed is unacceptable. Not building it at all is acceptable. Railroads could use some business if they would like to contribute to some domestic job growth. Then we are left with the treaty obligations and the rights and privileges recognized by The United States Constitution to all people. The Fraser Inititue will say whatever they are paid to say. The quality of their analysis often does rise to a Gr. 12 student level though. Any safety assurance by the pipeline company to Standing Rock probably should be considered a pius hope at best and complete lie more likely. My god. Yes, Indians engaged in warfare. They also practiced torture. They fought with each other over territory. On a few occasions, they committed atrocities against European settlers. People do bad things sometimes, and they are people. This cannot be used to justify generic slaughter and criminal maltreatment of any other people. The simple fact of the matter is that the people of Standing Rock are as deserving of lawful and humane treatment as any other people in the world, yet they are victims of historical and ongoing inequities against their group as a whole that deserve correction. Or maybe you do. Then get the fuck out of here. The Fraser Inititue will say whatever they are paid to say. The quality of their analysis often does rise to a Gr. 12 student level though. Indeed. Their report even owns up to the fact that pipelines spill a lot more than trains. But since the pipeline industry commissioned the report, they pushed hard on incident rates (which means nothing) and the fatality rate (lots more people killed directly by trains than by pipe). Regardless, it rather begs the question of whether we should be shipping the oil in the first place. Dunc says 5 December 2016 at 10:30 am Their report even owns up to the fact that pipelines spill a lot more than trains. But since the pipeline industry commissioned the report, they pushed hard on incident rates (which means nothing) and the fatality rate (lots more people killed directly by trains than by pipe). Stripping that one incident out changes the average number of injuries per billion ton-miles per year from 0.2594 to 0.0732, which is almost a factor of 4. It also give you a number which is a little over half that of natural gas pipelines (although still much higher than hazardous liquid pipelines). Title sounded good. Olav says 5 December 2016 at 1:23 pm From where I am sitting, half a world away, this does not look so much like a victory for the NODAPL movement. Sorry to have to say this but it looks more like a stay of execution. The outgoing administration does not want to be seen as the one that violently forced the pipeline to be completed, so it leaves that to the next. It looks like a rather cynical move. slithey tove (twas brillig (stevem)) says 5 December 2016 at 1:53 pm shit, let me butt in. Present Train Transport vs Pipeline transport, that way. numerobis says 5 December 2016 at 2:00 pm Leaks per mile and gallons per incident are shitty measures. Thank you. Lila wopila, Rietpluim. Present Train Transport vs Pipeline transport, that way. Even with the limits of per-incident reporting, 460 incidents of hydrocarbons (with a relatively even split between gas and liquid leaks) being released from a pipeline in one year from a single Canadian province should be concern enough. Maybe pipelines can be operated safely, but not at the cost businesses tend to be willing to operate them at. I agree. Anyone buffoon who says this should be ignored. I have had this accusation before, but sadly no, I am not a person from that place. Confused. chigau (ever-elliptical) says 5 December 2016 at 11:44 pm Liar.

The objections are present and pragmatic no less than they relate to breaches of promises (though they also breach a historical treaty). my back is sore must see a chiropractic Please do; you deserve that. Present Train Transport vs Pipeline transport, that way. On this measure, rail transport is significantly better (see, for example, U.S. Rail Transportation of Crude Oil: Background and Issues for Congress). For an example of some discussion of these issues, see Risk Assessment of Oil Spills to US Inland Waterways. Confused. No. Europeans killed Indians with warfare and disease, took over their land, and then promised the survivors that they could live on these scattered tracts of empty reservation land. Our ancestors committed genocide, but they stepped back from the brink of completely exterminating native residents of the land we took. To suggest there is parity between the actions of powerless Indians and powerful white American money interests is ignorant and offensive. not confused though the arguments are confused and not stupid or at least I am having a hard time believing he is stupid but I do not find it very hard to belief he is in fact thinking about this from a prejudicial frame of mind in fact he is showing signs of bigotry. giving the pipeline business and by extension the oil business all the benefit of the doubt and not considering any other out come than would not be a direct benefit for the energy business. He is acting and sounding to me like a shill for the pipeline business. I hope he is getting payed well. Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 13 December 2016 at 3:29 pm Prima facie evidence that the pipeline should not be built and run as designed. Creek in ND polluted due to a pipeline break. Roughly a third of the more than 3,000 barrels of oil that spilled into a North Dakota creek following a pipeline leak last week has been recovered, a local official said on Tuesday. An estimated 4,200 barrels of oil leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline on a hill just above the Ash Coulee Creek, and an estimated 3,100 barrels made it into the water, said Bill Seuss, a program manager for the North Dakota Department of Health. The leak was first reported to regulators on Dec. 5, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The incident may serve as something of a rallying cry for groups opposing the pipeline, which have said a spill could enter important watersheds and contaminate water. The point of release into the Ash Coulee Creek is about 18 miles from where it feeds into the Little Missouri River, which then feeds the Missouri, a major drinking water source, Seuss said.

Shares for both companies fell in the afternoon by 8-9 percent. Sunoco Logistics has been found to spill crude more often than any company, with more than 200 leaks since 2010, according to a Reuters analysis of government data. The tribe fears the line could destroy sacred sites during construction and that a future oil spill might pollute its drinking water. In response to the tribe's objections, the U.S. government earlier this month called for a temporary halt to construction along a section of the 1,100-mile line in North Dakota near the Missouri River. Sunoco Logistics is one of the largest pipeline operators in the United States. Energy Transfer is constructing the Dakota Access pipeline to pump crude produced at North Dakota's Bakken shale fields to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Once completed, it will hand over the pipeline's operation to Sunoco. Sunoco acknowledged the data and told Reuters it had taken measures to reduce its spill rate. This significantly cut the amount of barrels lost during incidents, he said. Reuters analyzed data that companies are obliged to disclose to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration when they suffer spills and found that Sunoco leaked crude from onshore pipelines at least 203 times over the last six years. RELATED: Army Corps to Study Dakota Pipeline More, Invites Tribe to Join PHMSA data became more detailed in 2010. In its examination, Reuters tallied leaks in the past six years along dedicated onshore crude oil lines and excluded systems that carry natural gas and refined products. The Sunoco data include two of its pipeline units, the West Texas Gulf and Mid-Valley Pipeline. That made it the operator with the highest number of crude leak incidents, ahead of at least 190 recorded by Enterprise Products Partners and 167 by Plains All American Pipeline, according to the spill data reported to PHMSA, which is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Sunoco and Enterprise both said most leaks take place within company facilities and are therefore contained, while Plains All American did not respond to a request for comment. The main option that was considered for routing the line away from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation was previously discarded because it would involve crossing more water-sensitive areas north of the capital Bismarck, according to the project's environmental assessment. Sunoco and its units leaked a total of 3,406 net barrels of crude in all the leaks over the last six years, with Sunoco saying it found that crude lines not in constant use were a significant source of leaks. However, In September, Sunoco received a corrective measure for its newly constructed Permian Express II line in Texas, which leaked 800 barrels of oil earlier this month. While total pipeline incidents have increased by 31 percent in the last five years, large spills of 500 barrels or more are down by 32 percent over the same time, the report said. Sunoco accounted for about 8 percent of the more than 2,600 reported liquids pipeline leaks in the past six years in the United States. The company has made previous efforts to improve safety, a former Sunoco employee who declined to be identified said. It overhauled safety culture after a spill in 2000, and did so again after another in 2005 that dumped some 6,000 barrels of crude into the Kentucky River from its Mid-Valley Pipeline. Sunoco acknowledged that some of its pipeline equipment dates back to the 1950s. Crude spills on Sunoco's lines in 2009 and 2011 drew a rebuke from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in a settlement announced this year."}, {"URL": "https://www.euromoney.com/article/b143qt6dlrb5d3/csr-choosing-greenpeace-over-clients-the-new-banking-reality", "Timestamp": "20180919005356", "Sentences": "If you're happy with cookies, continue browsing. It was approved by the Canadian government at the end of last year, but, in echoes of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), the project already faces 19 court challenges launched by First Nations, environmental groups and the cities of Vancouver and Burnaby. One has to bet prime minister Justin Trudeau has upped his yoga commitment these days. Having positioned himself as a progressive, compassionate leader who welcomes Syrian refugees and bangs the drum for women, ethnic minorities and the LGBT community, he is now supporting a pipeline that impacts indigenous people and will increase the production of fossil fuels. But faced with provinces where jobs and taxes depend on the pipeline and having reviewed its environmental impact, the pipeline won. It has left 26 banks wide open to backlash. From what I gather, Citi chief executive Mike Corbat turned down Kinder Morgan when the call came in to ask for finance support. It is the sort of thing I wish Corbat could say publicly without several of his clients cutting Citi off. The thousands that stood in freezing temperatures to protest the infringement of the rights of indigenous peoples may not have had the outcome they wanted, but it would be of comfort to know that their actions did create change. While the big four Canadian banks are bankrolling a large portion of the project, Bank of America and JPMorgan are there on the list towards the top. If Jamie Dimon thinks he is untouchable, he may have to think again. Being top of the oil and gas league tables globally is not something one wants to shout about these days. Lloyd Blankfein would be smart to keep Goldman Sachs in second place. Citi is not the only bank that has turned over a new leaf. HSBC, although in the Trans Mountain deal, has taken on the issue of deforestation and palm oil. In February, after receiving a petition of 200,000 names, it released a new policy saying it would no longer provide funding to companies involved in any kind of deforestation or peatland clearance. The bank also said that its clients would have to publish their own forest protection policies by the end of June. Chief executive Stuart Gulliver even appears in a video saying how he agrees with Greenpeace and the thousands of people who had written to him about the need to protect rainforests and that Greenpeace had worked with the bank on its new policy. In another Greenpeace-related issue in July, HSBC also forwarded evidence to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) that Noble Plantations was allegedly planning to clear thousands of hectares of rainforest in Papua for oil palm cultivation. Evidence Greenpeace, which had been investigating Noble for some time, wrote to HSBC, ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank in June with the evidence. While consumer goods companies have tried to ensure that no palm oil is produced at the expense of deforestation, getting the finance companies on board has been difficult; chiefly, he says, due to sensitivity in the industry around discussing clients. But banks now find themselves in a world where protestors can hold up a billion-dollar pipeline to bring financial risk to the lead managers, and the negative PR impact of an environmental or human rights gaffe can end up destroying employee morale and losing customers.

BEC CREW 9 MAY 2017 With the highly controversial Dakota Access Pipeline expected to start operations this week, the latest reports on the state's oil spill record do not bode well. According to the North Dakota Department of Health, they've experienced more than 700 oil spills in the past 12 months alone. According to Chris Clarke at KCET, if you averaged out all the oil spills in the state of North Dakota in the year ending on 1 May 2017, you'd have one spill every 11 hours and 45 minutes. And we're not talking small leaks here. That same event saw an additional 2,500 barrels (1 million gallons) of brine leak outside the facility. But here's the thing - if those figures sound alarming, they're nothing compared to the more recent oil spill that occurred in Billings County, just 2.5 hours away from where the Standing Rock protest took place. Back in December, it was reported that the Billings Country spill leaked 176,000 gallons of crude oil (4,200 barrels) into Ash Coulee Creek and the surrounding countryside, due to a fault in the Belle Fourche Pipeline. And that was five days after the leak had originally sprung. So yes, we're talking about more than half a million gallons of oil leaking out into privately owned land and US Forest Service grazing land, making it one of the largest oil spills in North Dakota history. The sad thing is this hasn't even been a particularly bad 12 months for North Dakota. The two largest even hit the 1 million gallons mark, with one spill resulting in 1 million gallons (23,800 barrels) of oil being leaked into the county of McKenzie in 2006, and it happened again in 2014, when McKenzie experienced a leak of 1,008,000 gallons of oil. One event on 29 September 2013 resulted in 20,600 barrels (865,200 gallons) of oil leaking from a pipeline in Mountrail County. That event also wasn't detected by the pipeline owners.

The 232-mile pipeline carries carbon dioxide to oil fields in Wyoming and Montana for use in enhanced oil recovery. File, Star-Tribune Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save An energy company is seeking federal approval to build a pipeline in eastern Montana that would transport the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide for use in oil production along the North Dakota border. Carbon dioxide is considered a prime contributor to climate change, but it also can be used to breathe life into old oil fields. Companies pump the gas deep underground to push out more oil from tapped-out reserves. Cedar Creek Anticline has potential reserves of 260 million to 290 million barrels of oil, Mayer said. Denbury, based in Plano, Texas, specializes in using carbon dioxide for oil recovery with projects completed or pending in Texas, Alabama, Wyoming, Mississippi and Louisiana. A second Denbury pipeline proposal would link the Shute Creek site to an existing pipeline network that extends into Montana. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is seeking public comment on the Montana proposal through Nov. 3. Denbury has not released a construction timeline or specifics on the volume of carbon dioxide that would be transported. Stop watching this discussion.

The increased seismicity is a relatively new phenomenon, simultaneous with the uptick in oil and natural gas activities in the state over the last decade. Though Oklahoma typically experienced zero to a couple magnitude 3 or greater quakes annually, the rate shot up to 20 in 2009. In 2013, the state had 109 such earthquakes followed by 579 in 2014, 903 in 2015, and 623 in 2016. In other words, the state went from some two sizable quakes a year to two or three a day. Fracking involves shooting a high-pressure stream of water, sand, and chemicals into the ground to release gas from shale. But in the process, hazardous fracking fluid and toxically salty water rise to the surface as well, so to dispose of this dangerous waste, companies pump it down a different opening deeper under the shale to rest permanently in a well of porous rock. In 2009, companies in Oklahoma pumped 849 million barrels of wastewater into wells. By 2014, that number hit 1.5 billion. Then on November 6, 2016, a 5.0 earthquake hit nearby Cushing. The Pawnee Nation has retained the services of law firm Weitz & Luxenberg, aided by Brockovich, to sue Eagle Road Oil LLC, Cummings Oil Company, and 25 other oil and gas companies for damage to its historic governmental buildings and reservation property resulting from what it alleges are human-induced quakes. At the damaged main communal building, a former school house built in 1878, white teachers used to teach skewed versions of Native American history to Pawnee students. Now oil companies are trying to school the Pawnee tribe in what they say is really going on with the seismicity, deflecting blame from the salt-water deposit wells. Eagle Road and Cummings did not respond to a request for comment for this article. Heading to Tribal Court Even though he was raised in San Diego and is no stranger to earthquakes, Andrew Knife Chief, executive director of the Pawnee nation, recalled the particular shock of the 5.8 magnitude quake. You could feel it. It kept going and going. The tribe has had to deal with the ensuing emotional fallout among it members and physical damage to its buildings. To boot, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt was a long-time Oklahoma politician who championed the oil and gas industry, a fact that leaves Brockovich and others skittish about what protections will remain in place to prevent earthquakes. And though it has found its reservation land shaking, the Pawnee Nation is bringing the arbitration against oil companies to its home turf: the tribal court. When non-Native American entities lease property on reservation land, as the oil companies have done, they agree to the jurisdiction of the tribal court, which often has a lighter docket and can more swiftly process cases. Brockovich visited a Pawnee town hall earlier this year and was back in the state at Oklahoma State University earlier this month with Bob Bowcock, an associate and water treatment engineer, to hold a colloquium about earthquakes and the plight of the Pawnee. The case will likely be a battle of experts in structural engineering on the cause of the damage, and liability on the part of the oil and gas companies remains up for debate. Kim Hatfield, chairman of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association's (OIPA) induced seismicity working group, recognizes the need for preparedness near the Pawnee reservation and in Cushing even as he allays fears.

Recently, Wells Fargo received negative press for helping fund the North Dakota Access Pipeline. Wells Fargo is one of several large banks providing loans and support for the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Francisco Ferreyra, a third-year community and regional development major at UC Davis and the environmental sustainability officer of the UC Student Association, said that Davis residents and several student groups asked the Davis City Council to also take action against the Dakota Access Pipeline. They care about two things: their profits and their reputations. The strategy for us on the ground is to hit them where it hurts, in those two spots. On Feb. 7, the City of Davis also ended its contract with Wells Fargo. Ruben Pulido, the vice president and communications manager of corporate communications for Wells Fargo, wrote over email that the bank will continue to support the UC despite the divestment. Pulido said that Wells Fargo does not deny lines of credit with private prisons. Due to chronic prison overcrowding, federal and state governments have for the past 30 years been contracting out detention services.

Suess said the spill migrated almost 6 miles from the spill site along Ash Coulee Creek, and it fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. The creek feeds into the Little Missouri River, but Seuss said it appears no oil got that far and that no drinking water sources were threatened. The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over. Suess said about 37,000 gallons of oil had been recovered as of Monday. Owen said the pipeline was shut down immediately after the leak was discovered. True Cos. has a history of oil field-related spills in North Dakota and Montana, including a January 2015 pipeline break into the Yellowstone River. The 32,000-gallon spill temporarily shut down water supplies in the downstream community of Glendive, Mont. Since 2006, True Cos. has reported 36 spills totaling 320,000 gallons of petroleum products, most of which was never recovered. The six-inch steel Belle Fourche Pipeline is mostly underground but was built above ground where it crosses Ash Coulee Creek, Suess said. The company has hired Alberta-based SWAT Consulting Inc. that specializes in cold-weather oil spill cleanups, Suess said. About 60 workers were on site Monday, and crews have been averaging about 100 yards daily in their cleanup efforts, he said. Some of the oil remains trapped beneath the frozen creek.

The Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain project will increase the capacity of a 53-year-old pipeline to 890,000 barrels a day from 300,000 and expand the tanker port. In recent weeks, there have been several large protests against the project, particularly in Vancouver, British Columbia. Environmental groups began condemning the decision as Mr. Trudeau was making his announcement late Tuesday afternoon, but the prime minister said that the pipeline expansion did not contradict his pledges to improve environmental protection and mitigate climate change. He said that spending much of his childhood with his grandparents in British Columbia and then studying and working in Vancouver as a teacher helped inform his decision on the pipeline. But while Mr. Trudeau said the government welcomed people expressing contrary views, their opposition would not change what he characterized as a decision based on science. A number of factors underlie opposition to the Kinder Morgan project. Some people in British Columbia fear that the increase in tanker traffic to the port in the Vancouver suburb of Burnaby will inevitably lead to a major oil spill. And, like the protests that led the Obama administration to block the Keystone XL pipeline project from Canada, many people see blocking Kinder Morgan as a way to limit development of the oil sands, which they view as a particularly dirty energy source. Environmental groups said they would move to stop the project through a variety of means. an environmental group previously known as ForestEthics. After a meeting on Monday with cabinet ministers in Ottawa about the pipeline, Chief Maureen Thomas of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, the indigenous community directly across from the tanker port in British Columbia, said in an interview that her community would mount a legal challenge if the project was approved. Court challenges by indigenous communities have previously stalled the Enbridge Northern Gateway, a pipeline plan to link the oil sands to the northern coast of British Columbia. On Tuesday, Mr. Trudeau said the government had told its energy board to reject that proposal. Rona Ambrose, the interim leader of the Conservative Party, criticized Mr. Trudeau for rejecting that pipeline.

In a lawsuit filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, the residents challenge the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to allow a private company like Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC, to confiscate property through eminent domain to build such a project. The Natural Gas Act, passed in 1938, allows the federal government to regulate the interstate transportation and sale of natural gas. A FERC spokesperson said the agency does not comment on pending litigation. Virginia landowners, environmentalists urge divestment to stop proposed natural gas pipeline New analysis identifies the top six banks financing the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The release of the final environmental review triggered a 90-day federal authorization decision deadline. Advertisement In response to the final environmental analysis, Bold Alliance, an anti-pipeline group, said Mountain Valley Pipeline failed to demonstrate a genuine market need for its project. Oil Change International, an anti-fossil fuel research and advocacy group, released a report earlier this year that found the annual greenhouse gas emission caused by the Mountain Valley Pipeline would be almost 90 million metric tons, equivalent to the emissions from 26 average U.S. coal plants or over 19 million passenger vehicles. The pipeline project will be constructed and owned by Mountain Valley Pipeline LLC, a joint venture between EQT Midstream Partners LP, NextEra US Gas Assets LLC, Con Edison Transmission Inc., WGL Midstream, and RGC Midstream, LLC. EQT Midstream Partners will operate the pipeline and own a significant interest in the joint venture. Virginia residents vow to fight on after controversial pipeline gets favorable review Anti-pipeline activists hope to change the mind of Democratic candidate for governor. Eminent domain is the right of a government to expropriate private property for public use, usually with payment of compensation. In almost all cases, FERC has granted companies the right to use eminent domain to build their natural gas pipelines. FERC has largely relied on whether companies have demonstrated an intent to use the proposed pipeline to determine whether a pipeline is in the public interest. The agency does not seek to determine whether the residents who live along the pipeline or elsewhere in the region where the pipeline is located will benefit from its construction. In its final environmental review of the project, FERC failed to acknowledge the fact that 100 percent of the commitments to use the pipeline are by owner-affiliates of the pipeline, according to the lawsuit."}, {"URL": "https://globalnews.ca/news/4111109/alberta-burnaby-appeal-trans-mountain-pipeline-showboating/", "Timestamp": "20180918225044", "Sentences": "Premier John Horgan is also seeking a legal ruling on whether his province can restrict increased amounts of oil from coming into B.C. while his government reviews oil-spill safety measures.

On December 4, the Army Corps of Engineers did the right thing by refusing to give Energy Transfer Partners permission to build a portion of the nearly 1,200-mile-long Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. It was a big win for the tribe and its supporters. Soon after, the corps withdrew its call for the environmental study, and Energy Transfer Partners began drilling the next day. The reversal was a slap in the face of the tribe and its treaty rights with the United States. Quickly, the Standing Rock Sioux asked the courts to intervene and stop the pipeline so its impact on the environment could be assessed. Energy Transfer Partners, however, claims that the chance of a rupture in the river is low, but there are three responses to that claim. In July 2015, the Michigan Petroleum Pipeline Task Force issued a comprehensive report of pipeline failures. The report cites many examples of ruptures over the last few years. In May 2015, a pipeline failed off the coast of Santa Barbara, California, releasing 105,000 gallons of oil into the Pacific Ocean. A few months earlier, another pipeline spill released 42,000 gallons of oil underneath the Yellowstone River. Two years earlier, a pipeline ruptured in Mayflower, Arkansas, releasing 134,000 gallons. In July 2010, a pipeline break released 840,000 gallons of oil, fouling 38 miles of the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. The immediate victims of a rupture of the pipeline would be the members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, now that the pipeline has been moved into their watershed. But the degradation of the water would also impact some 18 million people downstream who depend on water from the Missouri River. Under treaties the Standing Rock Sioux made with the U.S. government as well as under federal statutes, the tribe has the right to protect its land, its heritage, and its water from contamination by a possible pipeline rupture. The treatment of the Standing Rock Sioux by Energy Transfer Partners and all levels of government compel us to help the tribe as they fight to stop the pipeline construction from proceeding so that a simple environmental impact assessment can be conducted. The federal government has once again betrayed the Standing Rock Sioux and made a mockery of its obligations to the tribe while jeopardizing the drinking water of over 18 million Americans.

American Indians have a reverence and respect for this land that you can never understand or appreciate. Which is why you kick them aside, then invade, pollute, and destroy their sacred land for profit. Again, I question your welfare comment. Anything that America gives to Native American Indians, is not enough. In parts of West Virginia, Kentucky, and Virginia, mining companies get to coal seams by blowing up our beautiful mountains. Trump signed an EPO to allow the coal companies to then dump the toxic metal waste into the precious streams. Why, because the coal companies complained that the Obama regulations preventing such reckless poisoning of was costing them too much money. In Oklahoma, there is a human-made earthquake epidemic caused by fracking, oil companies forcing massive amounts of salt-water deep unto the ground in order to extract oil. The then attorney general did nothing to protect the people or address the massive amount of property damage. Instead, he allowed himself to be used by the oil companies to fight the EPA. Trump has made it easy for big business to rape and destroy America with impunity, and Americans paying the price for their recklessness, and having little recourse.

Technically, Congress has no more power over Indian nations than it does over individual states. In the 1970s Native American self-determination replaced Indian termination policy as the official United States policy towards Native Americans. Self-determination promoted the ability of tribes to self-govern and make decisions concerning their people. The Bismarck route would also have been more than 10 miles longer and would have made it difficult to meet PSC requirements to keep the pipeline 500 feet or more away from homes, the Tribune reported.

Daily and Weekly newsletters available. Unfortunately, we now have another example of the large scale disasters oil pipelines create. On Friday, the ExxonMobil Pegasus pipeline, which brings Canadian crude oil from Illinois to Texas, ruptured, leaking at least 80,000 gallons of oil into the Central Arkansas town of Mayflower. Arkansas' THV11 reports: It was a rough start to the Easter holiday weekend after an oil spill struck in Mayflower. Authorities said as many as 40 homes had to be evacuated Friday afternoon. Lisa Song at Inside Climate News reports on the size of the spill: The size of the spill remains unclear. Dodson said the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated the spill at 84,000 gallons. The EPA and the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management did not return calls for comment. According to a Saturday afternoon press release from Exxon, 189,000 gallons of oil and water have been recovered from the site so far, and it is prepared to clean up more than twice that amount. According to the Arkansas Times the spill could have been much worse: the break was in the same Exxon Mobil 20-inch pipeline that carries Canadian crude to Texas refineries across 13 miles of the Lake Mamelle watershed and crosses the Maumelle River at three places. Had the spill occurred on either Lake Maumelle or the Maumelle River, this would have been a huge disaster for Arkansas. Arkansas Senator Mark Pryor was one of one the seventeen Democrats that joined all the Republican Senators in voting for symbolic approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. Pryor has claimed the pipeline will help create jobs in Arkansas, where some of the pipe is manufactured, however as Bloomberg reported recently, the project will only create 20 full time jobs, not the thousands that Pryor, TransCanada and other supporters like to talk about. More videos of local news coverage below: UPDATE 1: April 1, 2013 - As with most oil-spills affected wildlife is often a cause for concern and this spill is no different. In an interview with Inside Climate, a local official gave an estimate of 2,000 barrels (or 84,000 gallons). Well, it's not ordinary crude. The crude oil that spilled in Arkansas is actually dilbit, which stands for diluted bitumen. The oil sands, also known as tar sands, contain a mixture of sand, water and oily bitumen. ... Conventional crude oil is a liquid that can be pumped from underground deposits. It is then shipped by pipeline to refineries where it's processed into gasoline, diesel and other fuels. Bitumen is too thick to be pumped from the ground or through pipelines. Instead, the heavy tar-like substance must be mined or extracted by injecting steam into the ground. The extracted bitumen has the consistency of peanut butter and requires extra processing before it can be delivered to a refinery. To make the thick bitumen flow through a pipeline, chemicals and water are added to dilute it. Benzene, a known carcinogen, is often part of the diluents mixture. So when you see a pond of oil in that Arkansas backyard above or the river of oil flowing through this suburban street, it likely contains more than just oil. UPDATE IV: As far as the corporate response goes, ExxonMobil has launched a web page dedicated to this spill. And, this is not an April Fools joke, their PR team handling the response is called Downstream Media Relations. Current regulations fail to protect the public against those risks. UPDATE VII: April 2, 2013 - Ducks are still coming into contact with the oil. New photos from The Hawk Center show the damage. It is like removing gum from someone's hair. ExxonMobil spokesman Alan Jeffers said only Hazmat certified individuals should catch or transport the oiled ducks. UPDATE X: Max Brantley of The Arkansas Times has a good piece on the concern over how the pipeline threatens water sources in Arkansas. He's compiled some good responses from Central Arkansas Water's John Tynan, who manages the watershed and Graham Rich, CEO of the water utility. Both men note that Exxon has purchased some equipment to deal with future spills. According to Rich, the equipment includes: One is a stationary boom that is placed in water to prevent drift of oil. Another is a mobile unit that could move an oil-blocking boom to different places. And in a letter about preparations being made to protect the watershed, John Tynan writes: In partnership with Exxon, CAW installed oil boom housing and other emergency response equipment at the former North Shore Marina on the north shore of the Lake. This allows for quick response in the event of a spill in the remote north shore of the lake. I am glad work is being done to ensure the safety of the Lake Maumelle watershed, but boom is just not adequate for containing the type of oil reportedly flowing through the Pegasus pipeline. As I noted in UPDATE III above, the Pegasus pipe is carrying dilbit, or diluted bitumen, which is thicker than conventional oil. As Lisa Song at Inside Climate News has reported, dilbit also behaves differently than traditional oil when spilled in water. What this means is that boom, which is like a long tube of paper towels and used to contain and absorb oil floating on the surface of the water, is not going to work when this heavy dilbit crude oil sinks to the bottom of Lake Maumelle. If there is a spill, boom is certainly going to be needed because some oil and contaminants will remain on the surface, but it isn't enough. What this shows is that ExxonMobil and other oil companies piping heavy, tar sands oil down from Canada just do not have the technology needed to deal with these spills, which are so frequent to feel inevitable. I've put a call in to CAW to raise this point and will update this post if I get a response. Thousands of gallons of crude oil leaked into a residential neighborhood near Lake Conway, leaving significant damage to the State's environment and to property in the surrounding area. Note: Check back frequently as I will continue updating this post as the story develops. See all of our Mayflower, Arkansas oil spill coverage here. It's not just a pipeline.

The Sac, Fox Nation, and Cherokee tribes are a few that have been affected. According to the Indigenous Environmental Network (Bates, Crawford 2012), an archaeological survey found that Keystone XL threatened 88 archeological sites and 34 historic structures. The environmentalists are another group protesting the project. Native American traditional culture believes that everything in the world has a spirit. The massive oil pipeline that requires digging over thousands of miles would be harmful to the indigenous peoples sacred earth. Your perspective changes depending on which cultural lens you are looking through. The oil resource brings economic benefits that are highly important to our government. Each tribe affected from the pipeline shares similar cultural values. They all believe that the land possesses spiritual qualities. We will take a closer look at the Cherokee and Denesuline peoples, and discuss how their cultures interact with nature and society. The Modern State Worldview Every society has a different way of viewing the world. With the rise of technology and industrialization comes an increase in overall population. When a population increases in a society, demand for resources also increases. Obama will increase oil supply by extending the Keystone XL pipeline. This will allow our refineries to obtain the crude oil resource much quicker. Those who use this approach are convinced that it will work, even if it ignores local interests and cultures (Josephson 2004). But, these traditional cultures are not the only ones concerned with the land. Conservationists worldwide are major opponents to developments like the Keystone XL pipeline. Reports from the National Wildlife Development assert that the Keystone XL pipeline will destroy swaths of important forest ecosystems, create reservoirs of toxic waste, and produce a significant amount of global warming pollutants into the atmosphere (Maestas 2010). This organization, along with other conservationists, believes that keeping our air, water, health, and prosperity is much more important than obtaining the crude oil resource (Maestas 2010). Again, we come into contact with another clashing of worldviews. Their anthropological history, which includes the traditions and cultures of the people, is embedded in the forest that is very sacred to many tribes. Maintaining the balance of the system is the main priority for conserving and protecting Mother Earth. We acquire an in-depth perspective on how these cultures communicate with the land if we examine a specific tribe. The Cherokee peoples protestation has stemmed from their cosmology, religion, and worldview. The Cherokee religion involves spiritual rituals and ceremonies that attempt at providing safety from the mystery and danger of the mythic world. The springs of rivers are said to be sacred entrances to this lower world. In their culture, shamans are the leaders of ritual and ceremony. Specific cardinal direction, color, and animals all have symbolic meaning towards something else. The Cherokee cosmology is clearly complex. It contains many different mythical aspects that are difficult for an outsider to understand. The point here is that they rely heavily on their sacred places, as well as the shamans that maintain those places. The streams and rivers are important for their access into the underworld once dead. The Cherokee rivers and cornfields will be directly affected by such leaks. Keystone XL is not just destroying the indigenous peoples gravesites. It is also tearing up their spiritual Mother Earth, disrupting their river underworld entrances, and possibly destroying their sacred Corn. Media that covered the protest of the Keystone XL stated that the indigenous natives opposed the project because their graves and historical sites would be unearthed. By learning how Cherokee cosmology works, and attesting to how intricate it is, we can see that their protesting comes from much more than simply protecting grave sites. The Cherokee object to the pipeline, not only to save their burial sites, but also to conserve the living, spiritual qualities of the land. Their cultural heritage and lands will not be preserved for future generations if industrial projects are allowed to continue development and expand on their land. Like many other indigenous tribes in the Americas, the Dene peoples have customary practices that follow a special relationship and care for Mother Earth. But, the Dene have an even closer tie with animals. When viewed from their perspective, it appears that ecological damage is making them lose inkonze, which is in turn making them believe they are less connected with reality. The conflict over the Keystone XL oil pipeline is inevitable. This approach ignores wildlife destruction and native land desecration. The Cherokee cosmology values many plants and topographic features as sacred places. The Dene view animals as the most important source of knowledge and are the key to making all life possible. These traditional belief systems are sustaining the conflict between native tribes and the United States.
