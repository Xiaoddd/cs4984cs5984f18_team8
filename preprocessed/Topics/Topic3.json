For more than three years now, Dakota Access Pipeline has done nothing but play by the rules. The Army Corps of Engineers agrees, and has said so publicly and in federal court filings. As stated all along, ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Original Story: The US Army Corps of Engineers has denied the final permit of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Instead, the Corps will be undertaking an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternative routes. We wholeheartedly support the decision of the administration and commend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama, the Army Corps, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and all of Indian Country will be forever grateful to the Obama Administration for this historic decision. We want to thank everyone who played a role in advocating for this cause. We thank the tribal youth who initiated this movement. We thank the millions of people around the globe who expressed support for our cause. We thank the thousands of people who came to the camps to support us, and the tens of thousands who donated time, talent, and money to our efforts to stand against this pipeline in the name of protecting our water. We especially thank all of the other tribal nations and jurisdictions who stood in solidarity with us, and we stand ready to stand with you if and when your people are in need. With this decision we look forward to being able to return home and spend the winter with our families and loved ones, many of whom have sacrificed as well. We look forward to celebrating in wopila, in thanks, in the coming days. We hope that Kelcey Warren, Governor Dalrymple, and the incoming Trump administration respect this decision and understand the complex process that led us to this point. When it comes to infrastructure development in Indian Country and with respect to treaty lands, we must strive to work together to reach decisions that reflect the multifaceted considerations of tribes. Treaties are paramount law and must be respected, and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward. We are not opposed to energy independence, economic development, or national security concerns but we must ensure that these decisions are made with the considerations of our Indigenous peoples. To our local law enforcement, I hope that we can work together to heal our relationship as we all work to protect the lives and safety of our people. I recognize the extreme stress that the situation caused and look forward to a future that reflects more mutual understanding and respect. Again, we are deeply appreciative that the Obama Administration took the time and effort to genuinely consider the broad spectrum of tribal concerns. However, it was becoming increasingly clear he was punting this issue down the road. Roads, bridges, transmission lines, pipelines, wind farms and water lines will be very difficult, if not impossible, to build when criminal behavior is rewarded this way. In my conversation with Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy today, she was unable to give any legal reasons for the decision and could not answer any questions about rerouting the pipeline. I feel badly for the Corps of Engineers because of the diligent work it did on this project, only to have their Commander-in-Chief throw them under the bus. The pipeline still remains in limbo. The incoming administration already stated its support for the project and the courts have already stated twice that it appeared the Corps followed the required process in considering the permit. For the next month and a half, nothing about this project will change. For the immediate future, the safety of residents, protesters, law enforcement, and workers remains my top priority as it should for everyone involved. Additionally, our federal delegation and governor have been working together in a bipartisan effort to push for more federal resources for law enforcement who have worked day and night through weekends and holidays to support the safety of our communities. It does nothing to resolve the issue, and worst of all it prolongs the serious problems faced by North Dakota law enforcement as they try to maintain public safety. Instead, it passes the decision off to the next administration, which has already indicated it will approve the easement, and in the meantime perpetuates a difficult situation for North Dakotans. By staying on the site, the protesters subject residents in the area to additional weeks of disruption and hardship. That will make our nation vulnerable and less secure."}, {"URL": "https://redpowermedia.wordpress.com/2016/12/05/energy-transfer-partners-and-sunoco-logistics-partners-respond-to-the-statement-from-the-department-of-the-army/", "Timestamp": "20180918225651", "Sentences": "This is nothing new from this Administration, since over the last four months the Administration has demonstrated by its action and inaction that it intended to delay a decision in this matter until President Obama is out of office.

However, under EPA's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) authority we provided comments in January and March of 2016 to the Army Corps of Engineers regarding its draft environmental assessment for the Dakota Access Pipeline. Without saying more on the matter, the spokesperson directed us to the agency's comments on the Army Corps of Engineer's first environmental impact statement. The agency spokesperson also noted the Corps chose not to hold a public comment period before posting its final review, as the EPA encouraged it to do. Today, after months of protests, the remaining portion of the Dakota Access pipeline was greenlit by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps approved an easement, or building permit, to finish the 1,170-mile-long pipeline, which will tunnel under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, according to a court filing. The crude oil conduit has been opposed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe for more than a year now. Fearing that the pipeline would contaminate their drinking supply and damage sacred cultural sites, indigenous water protectors have attempted to halt the project, which is owned by Energy Transfer Partners. Last month, the fate of the Dakota Access pipeline was ambiguous when President Trump issued his federal hiring freeze. As we reported, the Army Corps of Engineers was not exempted from the mandate as a defense agency. This meant that staffing issues could have caused it to delay the project. After the Obama administration said it would not allow the Dakota Access pipeline to be permitted, the Corps agreed to conduct another study and offer the chance for public input. The subtext of this command was clear: fast-track the pipeline at any cost. In this case, the cost could very well be human health and environmental integrity. I asked the Army Corps of Engineers to confirm that it had, indeed, bypassed the second environmental impact statement. A spokesperson for the agency sent the following response: The Department of the Army announced today that it has completed a presidential-directed review of the remaining easement request for the Dakota Access pipeline, and has notified Congress that it intends to grant an easement for a right-of-way across government land at Lake Oahe Dam and Reservoir, North Dakota. Mr. Robert Speer, Acting Secretary of the Army, announced the decision. Speer said the decision was made based on a sufficient amount of information already available which supported approval to grant the easement request and as a result, made the choice to terminate the notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement. The current proposed pipeline route would cross Lake Oahe, an Army Corps of Engineers project on the Missouri River. I've also reached out to the Environmental Protection Agency, which would have reviewed the pipeline's impact statement, but have not received a response.

According to DAPL owners and the Spartacist League, this is not Indian land. On the other hand, the centrist Spartacist League (SL), in a knee-jerk reaction to the environmentalists, ends up echoing the line of some of the most retrograde, chauvinist sectors of the bourgeoisie. They entirely disappear the blatant environmental racism, and argue that the native people have no legal right to control what happens on the pipeline route. Certainly pipelines in themselves are not inherently bad or good, but this is a subterfuge in order to refuse to oppose the DAPL route at Standing Rock. As Marxists, we defend the oppressed native peoples against this racist capitalist attack. Contrary to the straw-man argument of the SL, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is specifically opposing pipeline river crossing next to their reservation (as one can readily verify from its court suit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and various tribal statements). So say Energy Transfer Partners and the Spartacist League. But the land north of the reservation was stolen from the Standing Rock Sioux. The SL agrees. Pipelines are indeed safer than rail transport of oil, but even so there were 1,739 significant pipeline incidents from 2010 to 2015. In fact, Sunoco Logistics, which is slated to operate the DAPL, has the worst spill record of any company in the U.S., with 200 incidents since 2010.

Map by Carl Sack, cartographer at the University of Wisconsin, showing the lands crossed by the Dakota Access Pipeline which were guaranteed to the Sioux in the 1851 Fort Laramie Treaty and then removed in the 1868 treaty. The area between the Cannonball River and Cedar Creek is sparsely populated, inhabited only by a few hundred people (2 per square mile). Then there are the treaties. The Spartacist line reflects the mentality of land surveyors for the bourgeoisie. As a point of reference, if the SL has difficulty visualizing it, that is less than the distance between Washington Square and Union Square in Lower Manhattan. Because the crossing point is half a mile north of the present boundary of the Standing Rock Reservation, it concludes (and the SL land surveyors concur) that the tribe has no legal right to block it. Note existing natural gas pipeline in the same location (shown by solid blue line), thus potentially increasing environmental risk in case of an explosion. Click on map to enlarge. (Map source: U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) The potential for a serious environmental incident at this point is dismissed with a wave of the hand by these lawyers and unlicensed surveyors. Consider that a natural gas pipeline (the Northern Border line) and an overhead high-tension power line cross Lake Oahe at precisely the same point. When the pipeline was slated to cross the Missouri ten miles north of the state capital, Bismarck, concerns about possible water contamination got the route changed. But it has had consequences. So with tens of thousands of Syrian refugees being held in inhuman conditions in internment camps, the ICL raises these specious arguments to refuse to demand they be let in.

'script', 'twitter-wjs'); Jun 15, 2017 The Standing Rock tribe and its supporters protested the construction of the pipeline near the tribe's land and under its water supply at a lake it considers sacred. Boasberg did not immediately rule on whether the flow of oil, which started through the pipeline on June 1, should be stopped. The pipeline's construction spurred months of protests and dozens of arrests over its location near the Standing Rock Reservation and particularly its crossing under the Missouri River at Lake Oahe, the tribe's water supply and an area it considers sacred. The tribe filed suit in July 2016 after the Corps concluded that a cursory environmental assessment of the pipeline project was sufficient and released a finding of no significant impact. The EPA said the Corps' assessment did not sufficiently consider the impacts on water resources, and the Corps later agreed to that more in-depth review. In one of his first acts as president, Donald Trump issued a presidential memorandum directing the Corps to expedite the pipeline's approval. But Boasberg said the Corps was looking only at the project's construction, not the potential for a spill. Furthermore, the treatment fell short of the Corps' duty to determine whether the project would have a disproportionate impact on minority and low-income populations, as the agency is required to do by law. Boasberg cited Council on Environmental Quality guidance on environmental justice, and case law under the National Environmental Policy Act. Losing the ability to do so could seriously and disproportionately harm those individuals relative to those in nearby nontribal communities. The pipeline's builder, Dakota Access LLC, part of Energy Transfer Partners, has already faced leaks along the pipeline. Trump has repeatedly cited the Dakota Access project start as proof of his administration's progress on lifting government restrictions on development. And I took none. Actually, none.

Specifically, it will pass through an oil-rich area in North Dakota where there's an estimated 7.4 billion barrels of undiscovered oil. This oil would be shipped to markets and refineries in the Midwest, East Coast and Gulf Coast regions. This way, the project developer says, the United States could tap its own backyard for oil, rather than relying on imports from unstable regions of the world. But this is the Dakota Access Pipeline on paper. When it comes to the real-world construction, things aren't so clear-cut. THE STANDING ROCK SIOUX President Obama talks with Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II during the Cannon Ball Flag Day Celebration on June 13, 2014. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe sued the US Army Corps of Engineers after the pipeline was granted final permits in July.

Some residents of Cannon Ball, however, say the camps have been a nuisance. They also say you won't see all Standing Rock Sioux there -- many of the people residing in the shelters are from other parts of the country. THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT It's all about who you ask. Dakota Access claims the pipeline would provide a safer, more environmentally friendly way of moving crude oil, compared to other modes of transportation, such as rail or trucks. Supporters cite the 2013 disaster in Quebec, where a train carrying crude oil destroyed downtown Lac-Megnatic when it derailed. But one the Standing Rock Sioux's arguments against it is that it doesn't spur the country's move away from crude oil. Americans should instead look for alternative and renewable sources of energy, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II said in September. Opponents also worry about what the pipeline, which would go under the Missouri River, could do to the water supply if it ruptured.

Many of the reports that have trickled out relied heavily on statements from North Dakota officials, who often portray the Native Americans as dangerous. Beyond the contrast in rhetoric, there are also discrepancies between how each group has been treated by authorities.

Ammon Bundy went to local towns for meetings and to negotiate with the FBI. At Standing Rock, Sheriff Kirchmeier quickly established a roadblock on the state highway just north of camp: anyone trying to enter the reservation was sent on a long detour over dirt roads. As of Thursday, more than 400 protestors have been arrested. But a video of the event shows that the first physical contact occurred when a guard tackled a protestor who had blocked the path of a bulldozer. Paradoxically, these unarmed protestors received much harsher treatment from law enforcement than the armed Patriots in Oregon. The Bundy group frequently made the point that, without guns, they would simply have been crushed by police, and this seems to be true. Racism among law enforcement agencies has been well documented: in the wake of police killings of African Americans in Ferguson and Baltimore, the Department of Justice found both departments mired in racial bias. The Malheur Occupiers Were Found Innocent. The Standing Rock Protestors Were Assaulted. Two impassioned mass protests: one led by white people with guns, the other by nonviolent Native Americans. They arrested 141 people who say the pipeline has destroyed sacred sites and in the event of a spill would contaminate drinking water on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Bundy crew, which included dozens of other armed protestors, opposed what it considers unlawful ownership of federal lands. Occupiers barricaded themselves inside federal buildings for six weeks, swaggering in front of news cameras with pistols strapped to their hips and rifles slung over their shoulders, before finally being evicted by law enforcement officials. At first blush, the scenarios seem similar: a group of passionate activists commit civil disobedience in the hinterlands to protest issues that seem beyond their control. The simplest evidence of the disparities between the protestors at Standing Rock and the ones at Malheur can be found by looking at how each group has been portrayed in the media and treated by law enforcement. The clashes with police occurred when protestors moved onto private property recently purchased from a rancher by Dakota Access, LLC, a subsidiary of Texas-based Energy Transfer, builder of the 1,172-mile oil pipeline from the Bakken to a refinery in Illinois. Upon moving camp, Standing Rock protestors opened themselves up to charges to trespassing, a crime that provided police with clear justification to disperse them. When the Bundys made their stand, news networks arrived immediately, beaming footage of Ammon Bundy and LaVoy Finicum fielding questions in camouflage jackets and cowboy hats. By contrast, Standing Rock protestors, who number in the thousands, have been largely ignored by national television news. Many of the reports that have trickled out relied heavily on statements from North Dakota officials, who often portray the Native Americans as dangerous.

As of Thursday, more than 400 protestors have been arrested. According to Sheriff Kirchmeier, those arrests were made in response to aggression from the protestors. Several participants and witnesses I interviewed confirmed that protestors on Dakota Access land fought with security officers. But a video of the event shows that the first physical contact occurred when a guard tackled a protestor who had blocked the path of a bulldozer. It also shows guards urging their dogs to attack protestors, six of whom were bitten. Paradoxically, these unarmed protestors received much harsher treatment from law enforcement than the armed Patriots in Oregon. The Bundy group frequently made the point that, without guns, they would simply have been crushed by police, and this seems to be true. Wanting to avoid a repeat of Waco or Ruby Ridge, federal agents took great pains to avoid a gun battle. Racism among law enforcement agencies has been well documented: in the wake of police killings of African Americans in Ferguson and Baltimore, the Department of Justice found both departments mired in racial bias. In 2013 in Phoenix, Arizona, Justice sued Sheriff Joe Arpaio for systematic infringement of the rights of Latinos. A 2012 study showed that statewide, people of color were arrested and jailed at disproportionate rates."}, {"URL": "http://www.kappit.com/img/246117/unarmed-nodapl-activists-at-standingrock-reportedly-hit-by-rubber-bullets-tear-gas-water-cannons/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Kappit+%28Kappit%29", "Timestamp": "20180918225530", "Sentences": "With temperatures below freezing Sunday night, authorities deployed water cannons against people protesting the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline.

The line, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, had been complete except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. That stretch required an easement from federal authorities, which delayed a decision on the permit twice in an effort to consult further with the tribe. Jo-Ellen Darcy, the Army's Assistant Secretary for Civil Works, said in a statement the decision was based on a need to explore alternate routes for the pipeline, although it remains unclear what those alternatives will be. They haven't been following the law all along. In a statement, Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II thanked activists for their support in the protest effort. Protest organizers had for months argued that crossing the Missouri River adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation presented a danger to their water source. Protests grew over the months, with hundreds of veterans flocking to the camp in recent days to stand against what they say are aggressive tactics from law enforcement. Activists at the camp were seen hugging each other and letting out Native American war cries on Sunday, but many remained wary, knowing that the incoming administration of Donald Trump has voiced support for the line. Supporters of the line as well as opponents pointed out the Sunday decision does not resolve the issue. It is unclear what the new pipeline route will be and any route would still likely need to cross the Missouri River, probably upstream of Lake Oahe and closer to the state capital of Bismarck. Many pipelines travel under U.S. waterways already, and pipe is considered a safer way to transport crude oil than rail. Energy Transfer has said in the past they did not intend to reroute the line. Even if the easement had been granted, it would have been months before the line was completed. It is unclear whether Trump's incoming administration may consider taking up Energy Transfer's request yet again, and approving it. Trump's transition team last week said he was supportive of the line, in addition to other pipeline development. A number of states and municipalities in the country have made it more difficult to build pipelines in recent years. A spokesperson for Energy Transfer Partners could not immediately be reached for comment. hope they follow through here with this.

Pipeline construction over this altered route desecrated sacred ancestral sites, and, until last Sunday, was slated to cross the Missouri River at the Lake Oahe reservoir, which would have threatened the safety of the drinking water of the Standing Rock Sioux and millions of people downstream. Veterans For Peace (VFP), on whose board of directors I currently serve, is one of these organizations. We released a solidarity statement in September. A number of our members have been actively involved in the campaign. As of last week, DAPL construction was all but completed. Then, last Sunday, following various legal decisions over many months that allowed the pipeline construction to continue, the easement to cross Lake Oahe was abruptly denied by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The announcement came down just hours before an evacuation order for the Oceti Sakowin Camp, which was issued by USACE in late November, was set to take effect. USACE added that it would be undertaking an environmental impact statement (EIS) to examine possible alternate pipeline routes. After months of waves of brutal crackdown tactics perpetrated against the water protectors by militarized police and private DAPL security forces, which included the use of attack dogs, sonic cannons, concussion grenades, rubber bullets, pepper spray, and water cannons in freezing temperatures, thousands of veterans, under the operation banner Veterans Stand For Standing Rock (VSSR), organized by Wesley Clark, Jr. (son of retired U.S. Army General and former presidential candidate Wesley Clark,) and Marine veteran Michael A. Wood, Jr., converged at Standing Rock to stand in solidarity with the resistance. Based at least in part on their military experience, many of the veterans who joined VSSR wanted to intervene in and stop long-standing U.S. imperial policy of waging war for resources against vulnerable peoples. They understood that this was not something strictly happening abroad; it was also happening at home. They recognized that the violence against the water protectors was an expression of rampant U.S. militarism and structural white supremacy. They were aware that the targeting of Indigenous sovereignty by a colonial power is a strategic tool, used to dispirit, conquer and exterminate. They knew that the genocidal war against American Indians has never ended. Rather, it abates periodically until more resources are coveted, such as oil and lands to lay pipeline. Violation of the basic human rights of our Native sisters and brothers in the name of profit has been a recurring theme throughout U.S. history, often carried out through acts of state terrorism. The militaristic response by the state of North Dakota and ETP toward the unarmed water protectors has been one of the most blatant examples of this theme to unfold in modern times. The veterans of VSSR, like the activists who came to Standing Rock before, could not stand idly by and allow these abuses to continue. This is why especially courageous veterans seem to get along so well with American Indians. It is reasonable to believe that the convergence of veterans at Standing Rock influenced the decision, even if only in some small way. Officials may have been acting to prevent conditions that could have led to a confrontation between law enforcement and the veterans, which would have been a national tragedy and a political nightmare. All things considered, the veterans played a small but important role in a much larger effort to prevent DAPL from crossing Lake Oahe. More specifically, it was a win for the Standing Rock Sioux and the millions of non-Native people who would have been put at risk by DAPL going under the Missouri. It is an affirmation of the strength of the resistance, which demonstrated that prayerful people, guided by the virtues of fortitude, courage, humility and peacefulness, can indeed overcome enormous adversity. The power of nonviolence that was harnessed by the Native-led struggle on the North Dakota prairie over eight long months chipped away at the foundation of plutocratic and corporate interests that frequently put profit over people. Only time will tell if ETP has indeed been defeated. In a statement released by ETP just hours after the easement denial was announced, the company vowed to push forward with the pipeline on the route that takes it through treaty lands and under Lake Oahe. We know that the incoming Trump administration has different financial and business ties to the fossil fuel industry. The fight to force ETP to re-route the pipeline is probably not over. People should continue to divest from the banks financing the pipeline and urge these banks to reconsider their funding. People should contact their elected officials and demand justice for Standing Rock, including investigations into the hostile and unconstitutional acts of Governor Dalrymple and his police. History tells us that settler colonialism, environmental racism and corporate fascism are three very resilient evils. The resistance must be equally resilient. It is imperative that we put our trust not in the promises of government but in the actions of people who hold their government accountable to those promises. Nonviolent direct action has been proven to work in grassroots movements and campaigns against oppression. We are on the same page. I too came up with a ten point agenda for Kerala. 1.

The action came after police in North Dakota used projectiles, chemical sprays and water cannon jets in freezing temperatures Sunday night. Water protectors were attempting to remove barricades on a bridge on Highway 1806 they say prevent emergency vehicles from accessing the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Video from a live stream at the scene showed a high pressure jet of water hitting activists directly in temperatures below 30 degrees Fahrenheit. Medics estimate more than 160 water protectors were injured. The Dakota Access pipeline has sparked unified opposition from Native Americans who say the project violates tribal sovereignty and endangers the drinking water supply for millions of people who depend upon the Missouri River. Water protectors have used both the courts and protest encampments to attempt to prevent the completion of the pipeline that is slated to carry fracked oil from the Bakken formation in North Dakota to a distribution hub in Illinois. The editorial board of The New York Times echoed calls by water protectors Wednesday for President Barack Obama to take up the matter. And the Associated Press reported Friday that President-elect Donald Trump owns stock in companies developing the pipeline. Trump has thus far resisted putting his assets into a blind trust while serving as President, raising concerns about numerous conflicts-of-interest during his administration since the executive branch writes regulations and enforces laws that could affect his businesses and investments in private life."}, {"URL": "http://www.blacklistednews.com/Wisconsin_State_Patrol_Return_To_DAPL_Admits_Mass_Arrests%2C_Testing_New_Strategy%3F/57051/0/38/38/Y/M.html", "Timestamp": "20180919001201", "Sentences": "CONTACT Thank You For Taking Interest In Blacklisted News Blacklisted News is an independent platform for critical coverage of world news and beyond.

The deployment of 17 WSP (Wisconsin State Patrol) personnel syncs with a government-imposed deadline for protests to end. Similar to a blockade of food, water, and supplies months ago, this new eviction is framed as a safety precaution. Following eviction orders, 150 protesters marched out arm-in-arm. According to Wisconsin State Journal, ceremonial fires were lit shortly before arrests began. Numerous sources have reported about 10 water protectors arrested for not leaving. Officials claim the 17 WSP personnel volunteered for a nine-day stint at the reservation. Currently, personnel are arriving as arrests, raids, and surveillance continues. Last time, Wisconsin law enforcement pulled out after mass outrage back home. That force coalesced over 40 officers from various departments, including WSP. Upon returning, however, Wisconsin EMAC (Emergency Management Assistance Compact) produced a telling after-action report. Nevertheless, Wisconsin sought to learn from Standing Rock for similar future actions. The Fifth Column News covered these recommendations, among which included training officers in videography. In the most recent DAPL (Dakota Access Pipeline) raids, officers are doing just that. According to Wisconsin State Journal, the officers sent to Standing Rock were all volunteers. New blazes were then lit by officers, which many incorrectly believed were tipis. Although no clashes occurred, officers did sport Trump 2016 stickers on some vehicles which made protesters uneasy. Officers then left for the opposite hills, setting up entrenched positions until raiding the camp days ago.

As I walked along the dirt road that splits the community in two, I saw people of all races, ages, and backgrounds shaking their heads. one man yelled. In the distance, prayers were being sung and drums pounded, low but strong. During my all-too-brief visit to the camp last Friday, people from North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Washington all stopped to talk, or at least shake hands, in the middle of their work. They identify as Water Protectors, tasked with safeguarding their ancestral land and local water supply from destruction at the hands of the oil industry and the American government. My status as a media outsider who only made it to Standing Rock for a day during his Thanksgiving trip back home makes it impossible for me to make blanket statements about the camp. I can neither confirm nor deny if white people really are turning it into Burning Man, and I can't speak to the aggression of the Morton County Sheriff's Department. I can only tell you what I saw first-hand. During my 24 hours at Standing Rock last week, the police seemed eager to keep their distance after their violent use of water cannons and concussion grenades against protectors only days earlier raised shock and outrage across the country. Inside the camp, which runs between a two-lane road and the icy Cannonball River, workers raised tipis, kids sorted through clothing donations, and strangers from across the country chatted while chopping wood for the camp's sacred fire. The air at Standing Rock is heavy with deep reverence for the past and hope for the future of the land. It's been reported that if Energy Transfer Partners doesn't finish the DAPL by January 1st, companies committed to using their pipeline can back out of contracts, costing them millions. Time is running out. Police have begun stopping cars and trucks headed to Standing Rock with fresh supplies and handing out fines. Some say they've stopped plowing nearby roads. This weekend, thousands of armed services veterans will self-deploy to the camp in the name of protecting the protectors from militarized police. Next week, the evictions are slated to begin. The imbalance of power surrounding the NoDAPL movement is obvious. America's legacy of destroying Native life is undeniable. And still, the emotion I encountered most at Standing Rock was one of hope, built on human trust, holy traditions, and the vigor that comes from battling injustice. If the water protectors are beaten down, uprooted, and cast aside it will be remembered as a deep national disgrace suffered for the sake of corporate profits.

On her ten-day tour last month, Tauli-Corpuz visited tribes all over the country, from Albuquerque to Bismarck to Boulder. She also discussed the Dakota Access pipeline with North Dakota Senator John Hoeven and Major General Donald Jackson, Jr., the United States Army Corps of Engineers Deputy Commanding General for Civil and Emergency Operations. In January, the US Army Corps officially announced their intention to conduct a lengthy environmental inspection before issuing a permit for construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. Just days after President Trump's memoranda were issued, the Corps reversed that decision and on Feb. 7 issued permission to begin drilling. But it stops short of requiring the government to act on those suggestions, and tribal leaders and activists say their preferences have long gone ignored. He added that the report was spot on. In discussions with US officials, Tauli-Corpuz suggested strengthening the requirements for agencies to communicate with native tribes on decisions, and Anderson believes such a statutory fix is necessary.

DAKOTA ACCESS Tribes to court: Shut down pipeline Ellen M. Gilmer, E&E News reporter Published: Tuesday, August 8, 2017 Earthjustice attorney Jan Hasselman, representing the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and Fredericks Peebles & Morgan attorney Nicole Ducheneaux, representing the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, speak outside a federal courthouse after a court hearing in June. That's the latest battleground over the long-contentious oil project. After the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in June ruled that an environmental assessment for the pipeline was missing a few critical elements, both sides are now wrestling over what should happen to Dakota Access while the Army Corps of Engineers sharpens its review. To the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, the answer is clear: Oil cannot continue flowing. The Army Corps said last month that its revised review, which will focus on the pipeline's potential oil spill risk, environmental justice impacts and effects on tribal fishing and hunting rights, will likely be complete in December. If the court vacates underlying permits now, the company would face costly shutdown procedures and months of disruption in the interim. Much of his analysis will rely on what's known as the Allied-Signal test, established in a U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit case in 1993. Under the standard, Boasberg will consider two things: whether the Army Corps will likely be able to support its original decision on remand and whether vacating the decision would have disruptive consequences. In their own briefs to the court last month, government and Dakota Access lawyers argued that it would be unnecessary and harmful to shut off the pipeline now. The tribes listed a number of cases in which complete projects have been stalled or shut down after courts have found NEPA violations, including a small Montana gas pipeline that was shut off for a month for NEPA violations and a Colorado coal plant whose permits were vacated while regulators improved their environmental review. 'NEPA does not work after-the-fact' More than a dozen law professors chimed in with their own arguments in favor of shutting down the pipeline while the Army Corps supplements its review. In an amicus brief filed yesterday, 18 professors and practitioners argued that allowing Dakota Access to remain in service would undermine NEPA. The professors were led by Bill Snape, a faculty fellow and assistant dean at American University's Washington College of Law, who also works as an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity. Others signing on include the University of New Mexico School of Law's Clifford Villa, George Washington University School of Law's Robert Glicksman, Vermont Law School's Pat Parenteau, the University of Wyoming College of Law's Sam Kalen and several more. In another amicus brief, tribal advocacy groups and 14 tribes also pushed the court to vacate the underlying permits for the Lake Oahe crossing and take the line out of service. Timeline Yesterday's briefs are the latest round in what has been a dramatic year of litigation over Dakota Access. The tribes sued last summer, arguing that the Army Corps did not adequately consider the pipeline's potential impacts on the tribes and the environment, especially at the crossing of Lake Oahe, a dammed section of the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. They were dealt preliminary losses in the courtroom last fall before the Obama administration committed to performing an in-depth environmental impact statement to weigh the final approval to cross Lake Oahe. President Trump took office and quickly reversed the plans, ordering the Army Corps to make a swift final decision. The agency issued the easement in February, setting off a flurry of new legal filings that led to the June court decision finding the Army Corps' review partially flawed. The Trump administration, Dakota Access and supporters will file additional briefs next week on whether the pipeline should stay in service, and opponents will have a final chance to weigh in at the end of the month. Boasberg could issue a decision sometime in September. pipelines Related Headlines PIPELINES FERC restarts Atlantic Coast project Energywire: Tuesday, September 18, 2018 PIPELINES N.Y. project backer heads back to court Energywire: Tuesday, September 18, 2018 PIPELINES Warren, Markey press company, regulators on Mass. blasts E&E Daily: Tuesday, September 18, 2018 PIPELINES NTSB homes in on cause of deadly Mass.

The meeting was scheduled, in part, to discuss the details of the emergency evacuation order, according to Bigelow. A source at the camp told ABC News after Thursday's meeting that the federal deadline of Feb. 22 -- the same deadline set by the governor's order -- remains in effect for the camp to be vacated. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe began coordinating a cleanup in late January, but state officials say it isn't happening quickly enough. The Cannonball River is a tributary of the Missouri River. The Army Corps, in a letter issued Feb. 3, ordered those camping on federal property to vacate to prevent injuries and significant environmental damage in the event of flooding in the area. North Dakota governor issues emergency evacuation order for Dakota Access pipeline protest camp Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe files 1st legal challenge over Dakota Access pipeline easement Native American solar energy visionary equips Standing Rock protesters with green technology Bigelow, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe who has been at the Oceti Sakowin protest camp for the past six months, said law enforcement officials on Wednesday moved up the barricade separating protesters from the pipeline construction area to within a few hundred yards of the camp's north gate, the main entrance. But there was no law enforcement presence south of the barricade ahead of Thursday's meeting, Bigelow said. Bigelow said there was some tension this morning when front-load tractors and roll-off trucks rolled in to begin removing garbage and waste from the campground, which is situated at the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation. Federal officials from the Bureau of Indian Affairs remained south of the barricade this morning and were expected to set up a road block to prevent vehicles from crossing the Cannonball River Bridge during the meeting, according to Bigelow. The Army Corps granted an easement on Feb. 8 to the developer of the Dakota Access pipeline, allowing it to install the final segment of the 1,172-mile pipeline. Part of this 1.25-mile section will run under Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota just upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation. Speer said the decision was made based on a sufficient amount of available information. While the Army Corps says this area is federally owned land, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe cites an 1851 treaty that it says designates the land for Native American tribes. That lawsuit is pending, and the Army Corps and the company behind the pipeline argued in court papers that they followed a standard review process. On Monday, the court denied that motion seeking a temporary restraining order. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe filed a separate motion seeking a preliminary injunction directing the Army Corps to withdraw the easement issued to the pipeline company on Feb. 8. This court cannot wait until the harm begins to issue equitable relief. That motion seeking a preliminary injunction is expected to be heard in court later this month. After receiving the easement to build the pipeline across land on both sides of Lake Oahe, the Texas-based developer, Energy Transfer Partners, announced it would resume construction immediately, and indeed work has resumed. The Dakota Access pipeline, which would connect oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Patoka, Illinois, is expected to be in service in the second quarter of 2017, according to the company. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has been at the forefront of massive and prolonged protests over the four-state crude oil pipeline. The demonstrations have drawn thousands of Native Americans, environmental activists and their allies to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation. Darcy also encouraged the Corps to share company documents containing risk analyses and spill models that had not been made available to the tribes during the initial environmental review. She is no longer in the position after the change in administrations. The move to deny the easement was hailed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other pipeline opponents as a major victory. But on his second weekday in office, President Trump signed a memorandum aimed at advancing the Dakota Access pipeline, as well as one directed at the Keystone XL pipeline.

In north-central South Dakota, it cuts through Campbell, McPherson, Edmunds, Faulk and Spink counties. Crandon is southeast of Redfield and east of Tulare. Richard B. Kuprewicz said pipeline pump stations are typically built in such a way that oil releases stay within the station boundaries. He is a pipeline infrastructure expert and incident investigator with more than 40 years of energy industry experience. The cause could also be due to human error, he added. Granado said the line-fill process should be finished within the next few weeks and the pipeline should be in service by June 1. Walsh said all the crude oil was recovered through absorbent materials and was contained in drums, then put back into the line. Dakota Access was responsible for cleaning up the spill, which it has done, he said. The spilled crude oil, which is roughly equal to two barrels, is a very small amount compared to the 470,000 barrels of crude oil the pipeline is designed to carry in a day. Some gravel was removed from the spill site and will be taken to the Brown County Landfill after sampling of the soils is finished, according to Walsh. The Brown County Landfill routinely takes deliveries of contaminated soil from throughout the region. Once the state receives the paperwork for disposal and spill site samples, the case will be closed, Walsh said. This is the first and only spill in the state associated with the Dakota Access Pipeline to date, he said. In early April, there was a minor crude oil leak at the Dakota Access Pipeline pump station in Spink County. Your notification has been saved. There was a problem saving your notification.

It's the people protesting it. After the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a statement demanding that the Oceti Sakowin Camp be closed by February 22 over concerns of flooding, many protesters packed up and departed. Left behind was their trash and waste, NBC News reported. Oceti Sakowin Camp sits in a lowland area where the Missouri and Cannonball Rivers converge, making it a prime location for flooding. The record winter snowfall heightens the chances as spring arrives. And with flooding comes the risk of water contamination as trash and human waste could be swept into the nearby rivers. Federal and local officials estimate there's enough trash and human waste to fill 2,500 pick-up trucks, according to ABC News. Efforts to clean up the area are underway, but time is of the essence as the surrounding snow begins to melt. Standing Rock Environmental Protection Agency and Dakota Sanitation are currently working to remove the mountains of trash that have accumulated. Everything from tents to cars have been left behind after protesters received the evacuation notices. Around 300 to 400 people are reportedly still at the campsite, with some aiding in the clean-up effort. Despite the help, the job is only half-finished, according to the Washington Times. One of the main arguments against constructing the Dakota Access Pipeline in the first place was that it was an environmental risk, since a rupture in the line could contaminate potable water in the area. Now it seems the protesters themselves may end up polluting the rivers, if their debris can't be cleared out in time. She was Reason's Spring 2017 Burton C. Gray Memorial Intern.

It's possible that I could measure what I use in water and compare it to what they charge me. Electricity, I would have to spend more money that it is worth in devices to measure my usage. It is already a rate; namely, 1 watt is equal to 1 joule per second. SomeGuy almost certainly means that his kitchen is using 600 watts. If it was drawing 600 watts per hour, then after a few months, he would be consuming more power than the rest of his neighbors combined. In a decade or so, he'd be exhausting an entire power plant just for his kitchen. The power company confuses things because they use kilowatt-hours to bill you; 1 killowatt-hour is 1000 watts times 1 hour. But you know the answer: the taxpayers. They're on land controlled by the US Army Corps of Engineers. They don't have the proper permits, but they weren't told to leave either. This is almost exactly where my mind went. We really need Ron Bailey to explain the tragedy of the commons to us. Then delineate how we either need to appoint an agency in charge of cleaning up these protests, privatize the cleanup, or ignore the problem altogether. And that the latter two options are non-viable on their face. I don't understand why they weren't fined out of their ass for this. And it's not like the people who caused this are unknown.

Which would have been just dandy had they not trashed the fucking place. Trashing the place tending to diminish whatever moral standing you may have previously had. So IOW, I'll see your double standard, and raise you one. Color me shocked. Even the Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II expressed disgust at the way protesters trashed the environment. When the people you're protesting on the SUPPOSED behalf of start telling you off, that's a pretty good time to come back to reality and acknowledge that you fucked up.

This time, however, Boasberg acknowledged that the federal permits, which were granted by Trump's executive order in January, broke the law in some aspects. The president had ordered the corps to expedite permits, enabling the pipeline to cross the Missouri River, upstream of the Standing Rock reservation. Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II hailed the judge's decision as a major victory. For now, though, the pipeline is still allowed to operate until Boasberg reviews further briefings from both parties in hearings starting on June 21. After months of protest, the pipeline started pumping commercially on June 1, sending domestic crude oil through an 1,170-mile pipeline from North Dakota's Bakken oil fields to Illinois. In March, its systems spilled more than 100 gallons of oil in two separate incidents in North Dakota as crews readied it for its debut. The line also leaked 84 gallons in South Dakota in April. Thousands of people had camped out to protest the pipeline and its possible effects on water quality and to support the tribe. In December, the Army Corps of Engineers said they would no longer allow the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe, a victory for protesters. That decision was reversed after President Trump took office, and on February 22, the final protesters were removed from the campsite.

TOM STROMME, TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save North Dakotans came together Saturday at a Native American cultural event to start rebuilding relationships strained by the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. Reconciliation was the theme of a discussion featuring leaders from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, an official from Morton County, a landowner on the pipeline route and representatives of the Bismarck business community. Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said the pipeline controversy exposed racism that previously had been under the surface. But the pipeline demonstration that brought together tribal nations from around the world also had positive consequences, tribal leaders said. The event, hosted by the Native American Development Center, was a daylong experience with North Dakota tribal nations, focused on education and building understanding. Gov. Doug Burgum attended the event and recently visited each of the four tribal nations that have headquarters in the state, including a meeting Friday at the Spirit Lake Nation. Morton County landowner Doug Healy spoke about his experience with the pipeline crossing his land and being affected by the protest. Although the events led to some bitter feelings, Healy said he thinks landowners want to move on. Archambault said this might be a pivotal point in history for tribal nations. Rissa Williams, a member of the Bismarck Human Relations Committee who attended the event, said Caucasians should take an active role in building relationships with Native Americans. Chaska Moore, a senior at Standing Rock High School, said he hopes someday people learn to see past race. This can be removed when origin is fixed.

Many protesters are preparing to leave the camp. The rising waters, and a federal eviction notice for Feb. 22, have forced their hands. Others say they will stay and fight the Army Corps of Engineers, which decided last week to allow completion of the 1,172-mile pipeline. The drilling began last week. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has joined a motion by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe to halt the drilling. Horses still run free in the camp. Small packs of dogs dart about, tussling in the snow, their barks drowned out by the incessant whine of a snowmobile that wends its way through the slushy mess. Everything is white, brown, gray. The only flashes of color come from weatherworn tribal flags, banners that were jubilantly raised last summer and now, some in tatters, snap to and fro in the ever-changing wind. One day soon, all of this will be gone: the tepees packed away, the yurts pulled down, the abandoned tents and sleeping bags and boxes of belongings scraped up by bulldozers into waiting dumpsters and hauled off to landfills. Josh Dayrider, a member of the Blackfeet Nation of Montana, has been at the camp off and on since early last year. We woke the world up by showing how the oil companies treat the land and the people. Tanya Olsen stood next to her mini-camper, pulling out a mattress that had been soaked by rising waters. She arrived here in November. I knew very little about pipelines. But what really caught my attention was the mistreatment of the Natives here. As she prepares to leave, Olsen says she takes solace from the impact the year-long protest has had on tribes. The yell is picked up and repeated from different corners of the camp for a minute or so, echoing up to a snowy bluff overlooking the encampment where state and local police sit in a fleet of law enforcement vehicles, monitoring comings and goings. Quiet returns. But he arrived at Reagan National Airport to learn that final approval had been granted while he was en route. Their teacher, Kim Warren, a tribal member, said she made regular visits to the main camp in the fall, believing the protest was a necessary and valuable one. As legal options dwindle and the prospect of a completed pipeline that could begin transporting more than 500,000 barrels of crude oil a day in two to three months appears more likely, its opponents are taking stock. Dallas Goldtooth has been one of the leading voices of the protest, filing regular Facebook Live feeds to share the most recent developments. An environmental activist who is an Isanti Dakota from Minnesota, he wants supporters to know that their participation has not been in vain, no matter what the outcome. The fight never stops. It builds. It moves. Some activists have called for more protesters to come out to the site, but the Standing Rock tribe has discouraged that, asking that opposition be directed at the local level and at a March 10 march planned for Native American rights in Washington. The tribe welcomed the 200 or so Native tribes that gathered here in late summer and fall to help their cause, and it welcomed the national and international support that followed.

Standing Rock Sioux tribe chairman Dave Archambault II said the spill is another sign that the courts should intervene. The company and the state made no announcements about the spill after it occurred. Walsh said the department only releases public notices of spills when there is an imminent threat to a waterway or public health. A spokeswoman told the Associated Press that the corporation maintains that the pipeline is safe and that the leak was contained in the proper manner.

Cable 24 hours a day and Apple TV too. The decision breathes new life into the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's ongoing battle against the pipeline, which runs under the tribe's major water source. While the controversial pipeline, which has been transporting oil since June 1, continues to run, the possibility of it being shut down feels very real for the first time. The DAPL was the subject of massive protests and an encampment that attracted Native Americans and activists from across the country. The cause attracted media attention in the fall and winter, especially after clashes between activists and cops. Near the end of Barack Obama's term, the corps announced that it was looking at alternate routes, but that decision was quickly reversed under the Trump administration, prompting a court challenge from the tribe. The court found that the corps violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Under NEPA, a federal agency must prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) that evaluates the impact of a major project (like a pipeline) on people in the area and on the environment. The corps never did this. Watch: Toxic Air in Steam Valley In a sense, the decision puts them right back to where they were before Trump took office. The corps did prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA), which is the first step toward determining if an EIS is necessary. This was one of the issues at the heart of the tribe's case. The question now is obviously what happens next. That would mean the pipeline couldn't operate the pipeline until the corps complies with the law. That's complicated by the fact that the DAPL is already transporting oil along its 1,200-mile course. The court has the option of allowing the pipeline to stay operational for now and will hear arguments from both sides in the coming months. Next week, parties will meet before the judge in Washington, DC, to lay out the timeline for filing briefs. The judge could decide over the next few months that the pipeline needs to be shut down while the corps does its review. He could also decide to keep the pipeline running. The court didn't order a full EIS, but if after hearing arguments it decides that an EIS is necessary, that could potentially take years.

Tuesday's announcement dealt a major setback to Native American tribes and climate activists who have vowed to fight the pipeline, fearing it will desecrate sacred sites and endanger drinking water. Supporters say the pipeline is safer than rail or trucks to transport the oil. The 1,170-mile (1,885 km) line will move crude from the shale oilfields of North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico, where many U.S. refineries are located. Public opposition to the pipeline has drawn thousands of people to the North Dakota plains, including high-profile political and celebrity supporters. Large protest camps popped up near the site, leading to several violent clashes, including one incident where protesters burned vehicles, and another when police fired water cannons on activists in sub-freezing temperatures. Over the last several months, more than 600 people have been arrested. The opposition sensed victory last year when the administration of former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, delayed completion of the pipeline pending a review of tribal concerns and in December ordered an environmental study. But those fortunes were reversed after Republican Trump took office on Jan. 20. Trump issued an order on Jan. 24 to expedite both the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) and to revive another multibillion-dollar oil artery: Keystone XL.Obama's administration blocked that project in 2015.

The permit was the last bureaucratic hurdle to the pipeline's completion. With liberal activists marching in the streets to protest Trump on issues such as immigration and women's rights, the victory for Trump and the pipeline will present a significant challenge to opponents who have lined up against the new president. The protest camps dwindled after the Obama administration ordered the environmental review in December as the tribe urged people to leave due to concerns about trash buildup in a flood plain.

The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes sued last summer on other grounds, including that the pipeline threatened cultural sites and water supply, which they get from Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River in North Dakota. Energy Transfer Partners this week asked a federal judge to reject an attempt by the tribes to amend their lawsuit in part to include the religion argument. The tribes first raised the religion argument in early February, after the Trump administration cleared the way for final pipeline construction under the lake. They maintain that the pipeline threatens water they consider sacred. Dakota Access pipeline's long journey from application to approval ETP argued then that the argument came too late in the legal process, and U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, the Washington, D.C., judge overseeing the case, refused to allow the religion argument as a basis for stopping construction of the pipeline. The tribes have appealed his decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which also recently refused to grant an emergency order stopping oil from flowing through the pipeline. The company also filed documents objecting to a request by 13 members of the Standing Rock, Cheyenne River and Oglala Sioux tribes to join the lawsuit as individual plaintiffs. Members of the group, which includes Ladonna Brave Bull Allard, one of the main organizers of opposition to the pipeline, argue in part that they might be better suited to make the religion argument because they are personally affected.

The financial challenges for Energy Transfer come at a time when the company is already in a precarious economic situation due to broader industry trends, analysts said.

'script', 'twitter-wjs'); Jan 16, 2017 The success of the Native Americans opposing the Dakota Access pipeline has inspired other tribes, including a band of Chippewa Indians in Wisconsin, to oppose other projects on tribal land. Credit: Getty Images The Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians in northern Wisconsin voted not to renew an easement for a major oil and gas pipeline that passes through its reservation. In the wake of the successful protest against the Dakota Access pipeline in North Dakota, this decision is the latest example of Native American tribes using sovereignty rights to oppose fossil fuel projects. Pipeline companies often take ownership of private land through the use of eminent domain. The pipeline in question, Line 5, spans 645 miles and is owned by Canadian pipeline giant Enbridge. It is used to ship as much as 540,000 barrels of fossil fuels, including crude oil and propane, per day from Superior, Wisc. to Sarnia, Ontario and is part of Canada's largest export oil pipeline network. The resolution passed by the tribe calls for the decommissioning and removal of the pipeline from all Bad River lands and its watershed, which flows into Lake Superior. A spill from the pipeline could affect land and water that the tribal members rely on for hunting, fishing, and gathering wild rice, Blanchard said. The company said it had been working with the tribe since then to negotiate a renewal and Enbridge spokesperson Michael Barnes said the company was surprised by the tribe's decision. Tribal officials said they have not been negotiating with the pipeline company about the easements and vowed to ensure that the pipeline does not remain. The vote by the tribe comes amidst increasing concerns by Native Americans and environmentalists in Michigan. They who worry that Line 5 could contaminate the Great Lakes if it were to leak at the Straits of Mackinac where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet. Reps. introduced legislation on January 12 calling for a shutdown of the pipeline if a federal study finds it poses significant risk to the Great Lakes. If the company and the tribe do not reach an agreement, the company may be forced to reroute the existing pipeline around the reservation or shut the pipeline down. If the pipeline is rerouted, it wouldn't be the first time that a Native American tribe succeeded in pushing a pipeline off its reservation. In 1995, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Montana fought and won a similar battle with Yellowstone Pipeline Co. That pipeline leaked 10,000 gallons of gasoline in 1993, just as the 20-year permit to cross the Flathead Indian Reservation was up for renewal. When the tribes declined to renew the lease, the pipeline company had to use tanker cars to ship the fuel around the reservation, something it continues to do two decades later. Similarly, the easement for a gasoline pipeline that passed through the town of Bellingham, Wash. had expired when the pipeline exploded in 1999, killing three people. As with tribal land, municipal land in Washington State cannot be taken through eminent domain. In 2015, the Department of the Interior strengthened tribal sovereignty rights with regulations stating that the federal government cannot overrule tribal decisions on the granting of rights-of-way. The Grand Traverse band is challenging safety upgrades proposed for the Line 5 pipeline in Michigan, including a call for greater environmental scrutiny of the proposed work. Its legal objections are similar to arguments being used by the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota to halt Dakota Access. Enbridge officials would not specify what, if anything, the company had offered the Bad River tribe in financial compensation, enhanced safety measures or legal jurisdiction in any negotiations or offers. The company's spokesperson, however, suggested that they would continue to try to reach an agreement with the tribe.

However, at Standing Rock in North Dakota, Indians from all over North America have been protesting for seven months in some ways never before seen. Protest in this case is related to process. Part of the process was for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the agency that approved the pipeline, to consult with tribes about how the pipeline would affect their reservations and treaty lands, sacred sites and cultural areas. According to documents filed in federal court, the Corps did just that numerous times. In response, officials adjusted the pipeline route. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe chose not to fully engage with pipeline officials until late in the process. The legal and ethical argument is about tribal sovereignty and the protection of natural resources. There is nothing new about such issues. However, what is novel is that the tribe and the outside protesters are working together. The Standing Rock reservation set up a protest camp and made a stand with the protesters. What also makes this Indian protest different from others is its manner and its reach. Theirs is a nonviolent protest that is speaking broadly, in such a way that non-Indians can see that these environmental and policy concerns affect them, too. An overwhelming number of them are women. This all stands in contrast to the American Indian Movement, which flourished in the early 1970s, culminating in the takeover of the Wounded Knee trading post on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and the shootout with federal agents nearby. That movement had few specific aims, a violent tendency and little non-Indian support. The Standing Rock protesters are making the argument that the pipeline threatens not just tribal land and resources but American land and resources. The protesters are making a stand on behalf of all Americans for better decisions for our energy future. This is their sacrifice and this is their new Thanksgiving gift. A non-Indian friend asked me recently, in response to protests about Indian mascots for sports teams, where is our Rev. We Indians are a plurality. There are more than 500 tribes in the United States and we all have different cultures, histories, landscapes and ways of organizing politically. We are united by the legacy, and current practices, of colonialism. Like African-Americans, we have fought for and won some of our civil rights. But we have always fought for something quite different from that, too. We have fought for the recognition that we are American and Indian, and that as Indians we belong to sovereign nations and have treaty rights that have always been our rights. We do not have, like the African-American civil rights movement, a single institution like slavery to define our struggle, and a hard date when that was to have ended. But the protest at Standing Rock does have something Dr. King possessed, and that is dignity in the face of dire opposition. We also have the same kind of ecclesiastical calling, a call from God or the spirits, to not only ennoble ourselves through protest but to ennoble the democratic republic that seeks to diminish us. There is something inside the protest to ponder. And it is grave. We have seen water protectors maced, arrested and fired upon with rubber bullets. David Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, wrote in The New York Times that this is proof that government, once again, is against us. That it is once again cowboys versus Indians. There is, of course, a history of conflict. This is ever more clear in the violent backlash against protesters in recent days. But to say that the story of the Dakota Access Pipeline is another iteration of that old western story is to repeat the mistakes of past protests and movements. We situate ourselves in a position of powerlessness. It absolves us of our own complicity in how the world of power around us has been shaped.

(AP photo) Monday, December 5 was the day both the federal government and North Dakota authorities had threatened to evict thousands of protesters from the Oceti Sakowin camp, just outside the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. DAPL endangers the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux, violates their treaty rights, and if completed will be a major contributor to global climate change. There are people who have been at Standing Rock for weeks, or months. There are representatives of hundreds of Native tribes. There are people from all walks of life and perspectives. Over the weekend, hundreds of U.S. military veterans mobilized by Veterans Stand with Standing Rock had joined the camp and declared they will form an unarmed human shield to protect the people from the violence of the authorities. We came. We fought you. We took your land. We signed treaties that we broke. We stole minerals from your sacred hills. We blasted the faces of our presidents onto your sacred mountain. Then we took still more land and then we took your children and then we tried to make your language and we tried to eliminate your language that God gave you, and the Creator gave you. Lake Oahe is a Corps of Engineers reservoir on the Missouri River, and that decision effectively blocked, for now, the completion of the pipeline on its current route. During the day, people at Standing Rock celebrated, but they and their supporters immediately raised concerns about what the ruling actually meant. On Monday, Energy Transfer Partners arrogantly denounced the Army Corps of Engineers' decision. People in the camp are discussing and debating how to respond. Revolution correspondents at Standing Rock report similar sentiments. This announcement is just a ploy. And our correspondents report there is significant sentiment among many of the frontline fighters that they do not plan on leaving until they see the pipeline dug up out of the ground. The U.S. government has broken every treaty it has ever made, and the only promise they ever kept was that they promised to take the land of the Native peoples and they took it. At the same time, the fact that the Army Corps of Engineers decided to back off for now, and everything that led up to that, DOES show the potential strength of the masses of people. And it reveals as well the vulnerability of the system to both determined struggle and to the costs this was incurring to their national AND international legitimacy. and Revolution Send us your comments.

A federal judge on Monday refused to stop construction on the last stretch of the pipeline, which is progressing much faster than expected. Mahmoud omitted the comment about terrorism as he read his testimony aloud to a House energy subcommittee Wednesday. The comment was included in written remarks submitted to the panel. The chairman of the Cheyenne River Sioux, one of two tribes suing to stop the project, called Mahmoud's comments unfair. Law enforcement has used tactics such as rubber bullets, tear gas and water sprays against protesters during clashes in southern North Dakota near the pipeline route, Frazier said, adding that he personally has been hit by rubber bullets and tear gas. Mahmoud, the pipeline executive, also blasted the Obama administration, which twice delayed the project last year.

Many activists traveled to Washington, D.C., from Standing Rock, where they had been camping out for months in opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline.

While the controversial pipeline, which has been transporting oil since June 1, continues to run, the possibility of it being shut down feels very real for the first time. The DAPL was the subject of massive protests and an encampment that attracted Native Americans and activists from across the country. The cause attracted media attention in the fall and winter, especially after clashes between activists and cops. Near the end of Barack Obama's term, the corps announced that it was looking at alternate routes, but that decision was quickly reversed under the Trump administration, prompting a court challenge from the tribe. The court found that the corps violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Under NEPA, a federal agency must prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) that evaluates the impact of a major project (like a pipeline) on people in the area and on the environment. The corps never did this. Watch: Toxic Air in Steam Valley In a sense, the decision puts them right back to where they were before Trump took office. The corps did prepare an Environmental Assessment (EA), which is the first step toward determining if an EIS is necessary. This was one of the issues at the heart of the tribe's case. The question now is obviously what happens next. That would mean the pipeline couldn't operate the pipeline until the corps complies with the law. That's complicated by the fact that the DAPL is already transporting oil along its 1,200-mile course. The court has the option of allowing the pipeline to stay operational for now and will hear arguments from both sides in the coming months. Next week, parties will meet before the judge in Washington, DC, to lay out the timeline for filing briefs. The judge could decide over the next few months that the pipeline needs to be shut down while the corps does its review. He could also decide to keep the pipeline running. The court didn't order a full EIS, but if after hearing arguments it decides that an EIS is necessary, that could potentially take years.

A spill has occurred 150 miles from Cannon Ball, North Dakota, where protesters have fought construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Officials estimate 4,200 barrels of crude oil have leaked. State officials estimate 4,200 barrels of crude oil, or 176,000 gallons, have leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline in Billings County. Of that amount, 130,000 gallons of oil has flowed into Ash Coulee Creek, while the rest leaked onto a hillside, said Bill Suess, spill investigation program manager at the North Dakota Department of Health. Built in the 1980s, the pipeline is 6 inches in diameter and transports about 1,000 barrels of oil daily, he said. He said more than 100 people are working to clean up the spill. Investigators are still trying to determine the cause, he said. The demonstrations have turned violent at times. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe sued the US Army Corps of Engineers after the pipeline was granted final permits in July. The tribe said the project will not only threaten its environmental and economic well-being, but will also cut through sacred land. It said construction would destroy burial sites, prayer sites and culturally significant artifacts. In early December, the US Army Corps of Engineers announced it would look for an alternate route for the pipeline, although the pipeline is nearly complete. Companies behind the project have pushed back. Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics Partners said they expect to complete the construction without additional rerouting. They have taken legal action, asking a federal court to allow them to complete the pipeline. The Dakota Access Pipeline would transport 470,000 barrels of oil a day across four states, Energy Access Partners said. It will pass through an oil-rich area in North Dakota with an estimated 7.4 billion barrels of undiscovered oil. This oil would be shipped to markets and refineries in the Midwest, East Coast and Gulf Coast regions.

At Oceti Sakowin Camp, thousands gathered around the sacred fire to hear the good news that the Army Corps of Engineers denied a permit to drill under the Missouri River. But they know that may not be enough to stop the Big Black Snake, the Dakota Access Pipeline that serves no purpose but to make the ultra-rich richer. Then, on Nov. 25, the Army Corps of Engineers, backed by the North Dakota governor, issued an ultimatum, ordering all 7,000 people then living in the Oceti Sakowin (Seven Council Fires of the Great Sioux Nation) camp to pack up and leave. Tribal leaders refused, demanding respect for their community and territorial treaty rights. The evacuation order, in addition to ongoing vicious police repression against the water protectors, prompted a howl of outrage from all over. Military veterans, youth and the elderly, individually and in groups, dropped whatever personal plans they may have had and headed for Standing Rock. Social media definitely helped. Tribal leaders refused, demanding respect for their community and territorial treaty rights. Some came on bicycles or walked hundreds of miles to get there. They stayed in tents (with deadman tent-stake anchors), tipis, campers, yurts, old school buses, Winnebagos or hastily built wooden structures. Some came with body armor, gas masks and spray bottles with diluted Mylanta to minimize the effects of tear gas. So by the time Dec. 4 rolled around, on the eve of the threatened police eviction, many thousands were arriving at the camps. Celebrating a temporary victory As the line of cars waiting to get into the Oceti Sakowin camp stretched for three miles along Highway 1806, you could hear updates on the struggle on the Native radio station, 89.5, along with recordings of powerful, emotional singing and drums by Native artists and country songs that told a story by Freddy Fender and Conway Twitty. Then came the unexpected announcement. The Army Corps statement mentioned exploring possible alternative routes for the pipeline and the need for an Environmental Impact Statement, all requiring months of delay. Nearby the flags of over a hundred tribes flapped in the wind on the edge of the dirt road. These young warriors expressed defiance at the encroachments on Native land and water rights, but also sorrow about the recent suicide of a teenaged member of the tribe. Then came the unexpected announcement. A Native woman from Washington state said she came with two gifts. The first was traditional medicine from her tribe. The second was music, performed live by a young singer and drummer from her tribe. She said that back home Indigenous people were fighting a similar struggle to stop a toxic oil terminal. But we know they lie. They always lie, the government and the police. A huge march of defiance, led by military veterans, left from the camp to the bridge near where Energy Transfer Partners, co-owner of the pipeline project, had planned to drill the DAPL under the Missouri River. By now it was snowing, soon to become a blinding blizzard that whipped people with 25-mile-an-hour winds as they approached the Backwater Bridge. A young woman hit by a concussion grenade lost her arm. They beat, arrested, pepper-sprayed, maced, tear-gassed, strip-searched and hit the water protectors with flash grenades, rubber bullets and beanbags filled with lead pellets. Some who were captured got numbers marked on their bodies; others were caged in dog kennels. A Native elder suffered cardiac arrest. A young woman, seriously wounded by a concussion grenade, a weapon of war, was airlifted to Minnesota for treatment. Together with folks from the Sioux and nearby Cheyenne River Nations, this was described by one participant as the largest Indigenous gathering in living memory. Relationships were built between the different tribes, bonded in their common struggle. The size of the veteran participation may have played a decisive role. Brenda White Bull, who is a 20-year Marine veteran and also a direct descendant of Chief Sitting Bull, also played a role. Instead, 4,000 veterans showed up, filling three campsites. The day before the deadline for eviction, thousands of veterans, many of them Indigenous, arrived to defend the water protectors. They marched to Backwater Bridge, where, on Nov. 20, law enforcement in service to the oil barons had launched a potentially deadly attack. The march was a dramatic show of force by a united people in the face of a blizzard. Others came from Iraq Veterans Against the War and Veterans of Foreign Wars. Some identified themselves as Jewish-American veterans, African-American veterans, Italian-American veterans. The ratio of men to women was about 60-40. One said Standing Rock was a historic gathering for veterans, with many more vets coming to North Dakota than had come to the major Vietnam Veterans Against the War action in Washington, D.C., in 1971. By mid-week, forecasts were calling for winds up to 39 mph, wind-chill as low as 40 below. Many of the vets who answered the call are Indigenous, including Navy veteran Remy, member of the Navajo Nation from Arizona and the Indigenous Veterans Council at Standing Rock. This is our land originally. Land and the water are life-giving elements. Joan Baez and Willie Nelson offered key support. Warren is deftly dissected by YouTube personality Jimmy Dore.

Ominously, Energy Transfer Partners issued a statement Dec. 4 saying it would ignore the Army Corps permit decision and go ahead with drilling under the Missouri River. It could decide to drill and just absorb any fines or penalties. However, there is some evidence that ETP may be pressing ahead more out of desperation than anything else. If it misses the deadline, as now appears likely, companies with long-term commitments to ship oil through the pipeline may cancel, according to a November report by Sightline Institute. As a consequence of the global oil glut, oil prices have dropped sharply since ETP began the project in 2014. Wells Fargo has apparently experienced a drop in deposits, following the divestment campaign. Welsh, an Army veteran and retired letter carrier, stayed at the Oceti Sakowin camp in early December, working in the mess hall and kitchen that provided three meals a day to hordes of water protectors. Many thanks for the information and insights of Maurice Martin of Veterans for Peace, who worked tirelessly at Eagle Butte to provide medical support for the tribes and the huge contingent of veterans. They are fighting to stop the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which will carry highly flammable crude oil under the Missouri River. The pipeline would endanger the drinking water of millions downstream and threatening sacred native burial grounds. A Lakota prophecy says a great black snake will run through the land and bring destruction to the people and to the earth. But media attention has dwindled since the Army Corps of Engineers announced it would deny the permit necessary to build the DAPL through Sioux treaty lands. The world has stopped watching; we all cried victory. But climate change denier Trump is likely to overturn the Army Corps order once he takes office, and native leaders fear that Energy Transfer Partnership, the owner, will simply drill without a permit and just pay the daily fines. So the protectors are standing their ground and enduring the harsh winter. With limited resources and support, the Sioux tribe has been waging war against a multi-billion-dollar corporation that is set on destroying sovereign tribal lands, all in the name of monetary gain. Now we need to do everything we can to help the water protectors keep fighting and survive the winter. They are fighting for a cleaner, healthier environment: a better tomorrow for all of us. They are fighting this fight for everyone. water is very important for all of us and i think we all should do efforts in saving more water for ourselves.

The band government voted to not renew easement rights of way for the pipeline that runs from Superior east across Michigan. The band also called for the decommissioning and removal of the pipeline from all Bad River lands and the river's watershed. Blanchard told the News Tribune that the action was taken at a council meeting Wednesday. Bad River Band officials have directed staff to begin planning for the Line 5 removal project development and the environmental issues and hazards that exist with removal of old pipeline, including a health study, pipeline contents recycling and disposal and surface restoration. According to the band, 15 individual grant of easement rights of way for Line 5 expired in 2013. The two sides have been in negotiations since then over renewing the easements. The band owns interest in 11 of the 15 parcels of land within the grant of easement rights of way, roughly parallel to U.S. Highway 2. Enbridge, formerly Lakehead Pipeline Co., has leased an easement for the oil line since the pipeline was laid in 1953. Enbridge has responded to the band's requests for information and negotiated in good faith for the past three and a half years. In addition to working toward a mutually beneficial agreement,'' the company said in a statement. The company said it's weighing its options. It's not clear if the pipeline could be rerouted around the tribal land. That was an option considered in 2009 when the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa considered not allowing Enbridge's Alberta Clipper pipeline to cross reservation land in Carlton County. The two sides eventually agreed on an easement fee, however, avoiding a pipeline route that diverted around the reservation. The action comes as the ongoing dispute over the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota settles into a cold winter standoff, with both tribal rights and environmental activists protesting both the potential environmental damage from any spill and the movement of additional oil, the burning of which climate experts blame for global climate change. The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa has about 7,000 members. The reservation covers about 124,000 acres east of Ashland where the Bad River meets Lake Superior. Enbridge's Line 5 hasn't received much attention in the Northland compared to other Enbridge projects but it has become a focal point of concern in Michigan.

Standing Rock protest: North Dakota governor orders immediate evacuation Read more As the first snows have fallen and more protesters arrive in support, apprehension at the encampments about the coming days is running high. Police have acknowledged using sponge rounds, bean bag rounds, stinger rounds, teargas grenades, pepper spray, Mace, Tasers and a sound weapon. The explosive teargas grenades in use at Standing Rock have been banned by some US law enforcement agencies because they indiscriminately spray people, Lederman said. Dakota Access pipeline protester 'may lose her arm' after police standoff Read more More than two dozen people were hospitalized and 300 injured during the conflict, according to the medic and healer council. But footage later emerged showing police aiming the hoses directly at activists. The department subsequently conceded that it had purposefully used water on the protesters. The department has not responded to requests to substantiate the claim. Caro Gonzales, a 26-year-old member of the Chemehuevi tribe and an anti-police violence activist in Washington state, said the language from law enforcement officials resembled that used to discredit unarmed black men killed by police. Adding to the confusion is an exceedingly complicated jurisdictional terrain. The first Standing Rock encampment, known as Sacred Stone, was established in April on land owned by LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, which sits within the boundaries of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. But as more activists joined the movement, camps were established north of the reservation border, on land managed by the Army Corps of Engineers and leased to a private rancher. While the government asserts that the land falls under its jurisdiction, the Standing Rock Sioux tribe says that it has treaty rights dating from the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. Given the complexity, Ronal Serpas, a retired police chief and professor of criminology at Loyola University, said the courts needed to step in and provide direction for law enforcement officers.

It is very difficult to get an injunction in a case like this. The bigger legal battle is ahead. Standing Rock contends that a full environmental impact statement is required by law before a permit can be issued to drill under Lake Oahe, and that careful consideration of tribal treaties and rights under those treaties is also required.

The pipeline, which runs close to the Standing Rock Sioux Native American Indian reservation, is nearly complete except for a section running underneath a nearby river. President-elect Donald Trump has said he supports the completion of the pipeline. He has stocks in Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, the project's builder, and Phillips 66, which owns one-quarter of the pipeline.

Drilling under the river for the pipeline has restarted. Share story By Lynda V. Mapes Seattle Times environment reporter The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plans to shut down the Dakota Access Pipeline protest camp next week, still inhabited by about 400 opponents to the controversial project. The Army warns the Missouri River nearby is expected to flood and put the camp, used by thousands of protesters, under water. As drilling advances under the river, the two tribes on Monday, arguing the pipeline violates their religious freedom and endangers their water supply and cultural sites, requested a temporary restraining order against further construction. Even if oil starts to flow, tribal leaders have said they will continue to fight the pipeline. The Army plans to close the protest camp on Feb. 22. Construction began last week after Energy Transfer Partners of Dallas, Texas, received the last easement it needed from the Trump administration to complete the final phase of the more than 1,100-mile-long pipeline, drilling under the Missouri River. Both tribes also warned the pipeline could break and pollute the river, which is the source of drinking water for the tribe and millions of people downstream. Cultural sites also are jeopardized by construction, the tribe has warned. An environmental review of the project must be completed, including consideration of alternative routes, both tribes argue in their underlying suit. The pipeline is expected to carry as much as 575,000 barrels of oil a day. Energy Transfer Partners has long argued the pipeline is safer and cheaper than transporting oil by rail or truck. The pipeline has sparked protests since last summer. Police from nine states and 33 agencies have made more than 700 arrests of demonstrators since last August, and used tear gas, rubber bullets and even water during violent clashes this winter.

The move by the State Department comes 16 months after Obama blocked construction of the 1,200-mile pipeline, which would ship crude from Canada's western oil-sands region to refineries on the Gulf Coast. The pipeline became the subject of major lobbying efforts by both oil industry supporters and environmental groups, which turned the project into the focus of their climate change campaigns. Secretary of State and former Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Rex Tillerson recused himself from the process. Republicans and oil industry backers have touted its economic benefits and the thousands of construction jobs it would create, while environmentalists warned the oil artery could pose huge spill risks and would stoke development in Alberta's oil sands region, unleashing a vast amount of the carbon dioxide that scientists say is causing climate change. The White House would not confirm the report, and spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters at the daily briefing that he would have update on Keystone on Friday. While the permit will eliminate a crucial barrier for the pipeline, other hurdles still remain, including winning approval for the project in Nebraska and winning over landowners there who have denied it the right of way.

A tank inside a pump station in the small rural town of Tulare, South Dakota, leaked about 84 gallons. The station caught it all inside a containment area made of gravel and a synthetic liner. According to Walsh, the surge pump had a mechanical failure. A full report will be published once Walsh's department closes its investigation; it has reported that the pipeline company has done everything by the book thus far. Any contaminated gravel was collected and stored for proper disposal, officials said. The leak happened on April 4, but it wasn't noticed until Tuesday because of its small size. Local media first reported the spill Wednesday. The public often does not know about those types of leaks because of their size. Companies do not have to report oil pipeline leaks to the federal government unless they're over five barrels, which is 210 gallons of oil, and if they clean them up quickly. Opponents of the pipeline, who led a months-long protest against it, said the leak should not come as a shock to anyone. The seepage proves that there can be potential problems, they said. Protesters and their supporters are confronted by security during a demonstration against the Dakota Access Pipeline oil pipeline near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, in September 2016. Energy Transfer Partners, the pipeline's owner, plans to start pumping up to 470,000 barrels between North Dakota and oil refineries in Illinois 1,170 miles away. The protesters were joined by environmentalists, veterans and other demonstrators who camped out and blocked the pipeline's progress for months.

Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which will carry 470,000 barrels per day across the Dakotas into Iowa and Illinois was halted after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, permission to tunnel under a portion of land north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation without further environmental impact assessments. Construction of the pipeline was close to completion before protests against it halted progress. Despite Trump's framing of the pipelines as job creators, the economic benefits of both are minimal. In signing the order approving Keystone XL, Trump said the pipeline would create 28,000 jobs. As Jonathan Thompson wrote in November, the economic impact of the Dakota Access Pipeline will be similar: Construction on the pipeline is about 85 percent complete and it has, indeed, put people to work. Yet it is not clear how many new jobs have been created since the jobs are spread out over 1,000 miles. That, in turn, generates sales and lodging tax revenues for the local governments. In a few months, when (and if) construction is complete, the workers and their spending money will depart. The finished pipeline will require just 40 permanent maintenance and operational jobs along its entire stretch. Thompson also writes that the Dakota pipeline will not spur domestic production enough to measurably offset the 5.2 million barrels of oil the United States imports each day and will thus fail to bring America substantially closer to energy independence. Keystone XL's completion would similarly do little to insulate the United States from the volatility of global oil prices. And, of course, both projects reinforce American dependence on carbon-emitting fossil fuels. On Tuesday, Trump said yes. Read more in Slate about the Dakota Access Pipeline.

January 2016 Dakota Access Pipeline gets green light Dakota Access, LLC, a company owned by the Texas-based company Energy Transfer Partners, announced it had received approval for its permit from the North Dakota Public Service Commission. Advertisement The petition, which called for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, an agency under the Department of Defense that is responsible for evaluating permit requests for all water crossings, to immediately stop construction of the pipeline, received more than 430,000 signatures. Young people also organized a run to bring awareness to the cause. Still, workers began to clear the way for the pipeline starting in late May. July 2016 DAPL clears final hurdle The Army Corps of Engineers gave its blessing to the pipeline plans, saying in its permit approval that its construction would have minimal impact on the environment and would create local jobs. Many of the protests and other organized activity against the pipeline began after the tribe sued. Opponents of the pipeline began to camp close to the Standing Rock reservation. Advertisement Fusion spoke with three young Native Americans about standing their ground against the pipeline as the conflict intensified. Head chef Nantinki Young, 27, was tasked with feeding all of them. Dale American Horse Jr., a Sicangu Lakota activist, chained himself to a backhoe during a peaceful protest of the pipeline on Aug. 31. Dale American Horse Jr. was arrested after several hours.

There were later reports that some of the 141 activists arrested were temporarily housed in kennel-like enclosures and had identification numbers written on their arms. It seemed like the only two people not talking about the Dakota Access Pipeline were then-presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. As activists gathered to pray at the edge of Cantapeta Creek, they were met with pepper spray and rubber bullets from police. Police later denied to Fusion that the incident ever happened.

Ryan Vizzions, a photographer documenting the events near the reservation, told Fusion that even the police are trying to paint the Water Protectors as violent thugs.

President-elect Donald Trump has yet to show his hand on DAPL, but it seems extremely unlikely that he would come out against its construction given his previous support for the Keystone XL Pipeline and the fact that he literally owned stock in the company trying to build the pipeline. Despite the evacuation order, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, other Native Americans, and their allies have expressed no interest in leaving until they stop construction of the pipeline. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced it would not grant Energy Transfer Partners the easement they needed to continue work on the pipeline. The news was met with measured enthusiasm from protesters who had spent months at Standing Rock. The victory could be short-lived. President-elect Donald Trump came out in favor of of the pipeline.

Your weather is set to . You can change the location at any time. With an evacuation deadline looming, the protest camp at Standing Rock went up in flames. For nearly a year, it had been the setting for a bitter showdown between opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) project and the project's developers. Crowds that once numbered 10,000 dwindled to dozens Wednesday after an evacuation order from North Dakota's governor. Stragglers faced arrest. Some set fire to the tents and teepees that housed them there in an act of defiance, native ritual or both. He'd gone to Standing Rock last year and been there during a violent clash between protesters and security personnel that helped thrust the protest into the international spotlight. He's also spent years fighting a natural gas pipeline project in his own backyard, one set to cross through 10 Pennsylvania counties and 200 miles of terrain. For Clatterbuck and activists like him, Standing Rock was a watershed moment, he explained, and its lessons and catalytic properties capable of being taken home and re-harnessed. Just last week, Clatterbuck helped oversee the beginnings of a DAPL-inspired encampment on an Amish farm in Lancaster County atop the route of the proposed pipeline he's spent years working to stop. Much of this interest owes to the pre-existing efforts of organizers like Clatterbuck and his wife Malinda, who've spent years relentlessly -- and sometimes controversially -- drumming up a local opposition. But the heightened profile and popular support for Standing Rock hasn't hurt either. 'Center of the resistance' Mark Clatterbuck made the 1,500-mile drive from Lancaster County to Standing Rock over Labor Day weekend. He was joined by his high-school-age daughter and two other members of the Lancaster Against Pipelines group that Mark and his wife co-founded almost three years earlier. In North Dakota, the foursome joined members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, representatives of more than 200 Indigenous nations from across the Americas and their supporters. Some had been encamped at the site for months by then in an attempt to block construction of the pipeline they say violates sacred sites and threatens the Standing Rock Reservation's primary water source. That Saturday, when protesters attempted to block construction equipment at the site, a phalanx of private security guards met them with dogs and mace in a confrontation rebroadcast on news sites and social media networks for weeks after. Clatterbuck says his daughter was at the scene of the melee that day. And while she wasn't injured, he was clearly shaken. ... Atlantic Sunrise natural gas pipeline will have 'less-than-significant' impact, feds say Clatterbuck would soon return to Lancaster County and his teenage daughter to school, while the other members of their party stayed behind. Clatterbuck would also resume what has been a years-long and some might argue quixotic effort to block construction of the Atlantic Sunrise Pipeline project at home. In January of 2015, Clatterbuck was among eight people arrested for blocking equipment they said was being used to improperly drill test bores on sacred grounds along the pipeline route in Conestoga Township, Lancaster County. In October of last year, a wooden structure -- picture a mix between a lookout tower and garden shed -- was erected nearby in an attempt to help opponents block future pipeline construction. Clatterbuck told NPR's State Impact website that they had been inspired to do so by the Dakota Access opposition. But even long before Dakota Access became a household name, Lancaster County was the scene of numerous public meetings in which angry crowds denounced the Atlantic Sunrise project and a regulatory system seen as toothless at best and beholden to the energy industry at worst. 'As long as it takes' There are concerns about the potential futility of such an exercise, though, especially given the outcome in North Dakota and the support for similar pipeline projects currently emanating from the Oval Office. Alex Bomstein, senior litigation attorney with the Clean Air Council in Philadelphia, said for agencies like the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which oversees and already approved the Atlantic Sunrise project, he expects no radical shift under Trump. Instead, he said the agency viewed as pro-pipeline under Obama may somehow find a way to become even more so. After several decades of approving every pipeline project it reviewed, FERC issued its first rejection in March of last year. It is against this backdrop and new political climate that the smaller protest groups that coalesced around the Dakota Access cause find themselves returning to their respective corners of the country looking to seize some kind of momentum in the face of ever-mounting odds. Meanwhile, in Lancaster County, a Dakota Access-inspired encampment is already taking shape. It's located at the site of the wooden structure (now structures) erected along the Atlantic Sunrise route in Conestoga last fall. For now, occupancy is fairly informal, but Clatterbuck expects that to change once construction on the pipeline begins. Trump orders U.S. steel be used for oil and gas pipelines, while Pa. Martin said the tentative plan is to use the camp as a home base and move near construction as it crops up. And while there are differences between the Dakota Access pipeline's opposition -- one buoyed by a deep-seated tribal sovereignty movement and historic tensions between the U.S. government and native peoples -- there are also parallels, as explained here. READ MORE: Sacred Sites And Treaty Rights - The Dakota Access Backstory FERC has also acknowledged the intersect between the proposed pipeline's path and historic indigenous sites in Lancaster County, but says the pipeline will travel under those sites as opposed to through them. This is of no comfort to the project's critics, including those Native Americans among them. In the end, and if Dakota Access's success as a broader rallying cry is any indication, this tension may benefit and bolster the resistance planned in Lancaster County, some believe. 'Physically stop construction' But even Clatterbuck's supporters acknowledge that the odds of stopping the Atlantic Sunrise project are perhaps steeper than ever, although they're not resigned to that reality, even in the wake of Standing Rock's fall. This is the first step in eminent domain proceedings. Another 13 have been filed in the federal Eastern District for property easements in Lancaster County. Meanwhile, some 1,500 miles to the west on Thursday, law enforcement agents began rounding up the last of the Dakota Access protesters to begin a clean up of the Standing Rock site. The project is completed except for the contested portion under North Dakota's Lake Oahe, half a mile upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's reservation, CNN reports. President Trump signed an executive memorandum in late January meant to expedite that process. In Pennsylvania, the Atlantic Sunrise project has received FERC approval and is currently awaiting approval from the Department of Environmental Protection and Army Corps of Engineers. And after years of unsuccessfully lobbying regulators to pull the plug, and with the chances of a successful legal challenge before construction begins largely debunked, opponents like Clatterbuck say they fully expect the project to clear those final hurdles as well. They are prepared for that eventuality, he added. Meanwhile, with the experience at Standing Rock still ringing in his ears, Clatterbuck said he's also preparing for much, much more.

They've come from Japan, Russia and Germany. Australia, Israel and Serbia. And, of course, there are the allies, not exclusively Native American or indigenous, who've flocked here from all corners of the US. They're fighting against what they see as corporate greed, an environmental threat and an assault on sacred land. Demonstrating is their proud daily work. The Standing Rock Sioux call this reservation home, and many are not on the frontlines of this months-long, and at times violent, protest. Read More The answer to that last question: Not even close. Wishing they'd go home No one makes this clearer than Robert Fool Bear Sr., 54, district chairman of Cannon Ball. The town he runs, estimated population of 840, is just a few miles from the action. It's so close that, given the faceoffs with law enforcement, you have to pass through a police checkpoint to reach it. It's about time people heard from folks like him, he says. Fool Bear has had it with the protesters. He says that more than two years ago, when members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe could have attended hearings to make their concerns known, they didn't care. Now, suddenly, the crowds are out of control, and he fears it's just a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt. Go down to the camps, he says, and you won't see many Standing Rock Sioux. The presence of all these people has become a downright nuisance to his community, he says. Given the roadblocks, residents of Cannon Ball are often forced to go more than 40 miles out of their way. Native Americans march to the site of a sacred burial ground that was disturbed by bulldozers building the Dakota Access Pipeline on September 4, 2016 near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Not long ago, he found three teenage girls from Ontario, Canada, camped out inside his storage shed. A white woman from Spokane, Washington, came to see him for help, saying she'd come here with nothing and her car had broken down. When he was at the casino recently, someone approached him about two young kids who were on their own because their parents had been arrested. The situation has dissolved to madness, he says, and he wishes Dave Archambault II, the Standing Rock Sioux chairman, would speak up. And he's not alone in feeling this way. Two women who listen in as he talks keep nodding in agreement, but they don't want to speak. Just look at a recent vote in the community for further proof that Fool Bear's not the only naysayer. When protest organizers presented a request to build a new winter camp in Cannon Ball earlier this month, his community shot it down. Of the 88 people who voted, he says 66 were against the camp, less than 10 were for it and the rest remained undecided. A Standing Rock Sioux flag flies over a protest encampment near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Even though Fool Bear is against the protests, that doesn't mean he's not preparing to help people out, too. He anticipates opening the community gymnasium for people without beds come winter, and a growing pile of sleeping bags and blankets sits in his office. Those protesters from Arizona, Georgia and California won't know what hit them when the cold rushes in, he says.

A fight worth having The tribal headquarters sits in the Sioux County seat of Fort Yates, nearly 30 miles south of the protests. To hear it from those hanging out in Club Diamond Z, a bar and deli, Standing Rock Sioux support of the protests is universal. They can't fathom how anyone would disagree. Artist Roger Valandra, 61, says he travels north to join the protests once a week. A proud Vietnam Vet, he says the freedom to peacefully demonstrate was something he fought for, just like his nieces and nephews who've served in Iraq. To feel suppressed by the nation he's served offends him. He's baffled by the flood of law enforcement from nearby states and North Dakota counties he's never even heard of. Any violence, he says, was provoked by them. Valandra and those around him at the bar begin to rattle off the offenses, many of which they heard about through social media. They talk about tear gas, rubber bullets, sound cannons and concussion grenades. They speak about the elder who was beaten with a club, the horse that had to be put down, the boy whose wrist was broken. She grew up believing racism didn't exist; not anymore. She brings up the recent acquittal of Ammon Bundy and six others, who occupied a federal wildlife refuge earlier this year.

Online comments and the stereotyping of her people leave her stunned. She wants people to know this battle isn't about race. Her father doesn't question what will happen to the reservation's water if the pipeline goes in. Just look at the track record of oil companies, he says, and understand that the problem will grow.

It'll mean fewer trucks barreling down these rural highways and fewer trains flying down the tracks. Back at Cannon Ball, however, Carl Bruce, 52, isn't afraid to say his piece. For this Standing Rock Sioux who has lived his life here, the pipeline doesn't matter. If it breaks, he says he'd just work around it. The pipeline is coming, like it or not, he says.

(Reuters) - A Minnesota regulator on Thursday approved a certificate of need for Enbridge Inc to rebuild its Line 3 oil pipeline, angering environmentalists but offering hope to Western Canadian oil producers that have struggled to move crude oil to refiners. An activist opposing the Enbridge Line 3 oil pipeline, dangles from a steel structure erected outside the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission office in St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S., June 28, 2018. Shares of Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge closed up 3.7 percent in Toronto. Pipeline bottlenecks have steepened a price discount for Western Canadian heavy crude this year. Refiners in Minnesota and surrounding states say Line 3 is necessary to increase crude supplies. Shouts from Native Americans and environmental activists interrupted the meeting. Environmental groups and some indigenous communities oppose the project over concerns about spills and impact on tribal wild rice harvesting areas. The Standing Rock tribe led opposition in 2016 to the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, one of the most bitterly contested energy projects in years. It was eventually built. The coalition of Line 3 opponents is likely to formally request that the commission reconsider its approval, said Joe Plumer, lawyer for White Earth Nation. He said he continues to expect the rebuilt pipeline to begin service in the second half of 2019. Line 3, which began service in 1968, operates at half its capacity. Its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day. Several commissioners voiced doubts that demand for crude oil and refined products such as gasoline would grow enough to warrant the pipeline. The rebuilt Line 3 will follow the existing pipeline path partway through Minnesota, before veering south to bypass Leech Lake reserve and avoid a need to shut down the pipeline for up to one year during construction. The path of a short stretch near Fond du Lac reserve will be determined by negotiations between the tribe and Enbridge. Fond du Lac lawyer Seth Bichler told the commission that the tribes preferred a longer route to the south that would avoid more sensitive land. Recognized parties, including Enbridge, environmental and indigenous groups, have 20 days from the time a written order is issued - likely in a couple of weeks - to ask the commission to reconsider. Line 3 also requires 29 additional permits from local, state and federal levels, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton said in a statement.

Standing Rock became a ghost town last week after police raided and razed the prayer camp that once hosted thousands of water protectors. Earlier this month, the Trump administration fast-tracked approval to build the final section of the pipeline and cancelled the environmental impact statement ordered by President Obama. Construction is nearing completion and oil could flow through the pipeline as early as March 6. It may be a long shot, but a legal win is still possible, some advocates say. A legal challenge filed by the tribe on Feb. 14 charges pipeline builder Dakota Access, LLC, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers with a range of environmental, cultural, and treaty-based violations. It asks a federal judge to rule on whether the Army Corps broke laws and treaties by allowing construction of the last leg of the pipeline under Lake Oahe, a reservoir along the Missouri River in North Dakota. Tribes like the Sioux are independent, self-governing nations like any other in the world. And the sovereignty of tribal nations preexists the United States, just like the nations themselves. Many Native Americans believe that this sovereignty is now under extreme threat. The administration of Donald Trump may be the most hostile to Indian tribes since that of Andrew Jackson, who caused the Trail of Tears in the 1830s, argues Matthew Fletcher, a professor of law at Michigan State University and a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians. If the current legal motion fails, he says the tribe will appeal in federal circuit court. Even if oil starts flowing in the pipeline in the interim, it could still be shut off down the line, Hasselman told the Bismarck Tribune. And tribes are waging other legal battles against the pipeline too. On Feb. 9, the Cheyenne River Sioux filed a motion to temporarily halt construction on the grounds that the pipeline would violate their right to religious freedom by desecrating the sacred waters of Lake Oahe. The Oglala Sioux Tribe joined the fray on Feb. 13 with its own lawsuit claiming that the pipeline threatened its treaty rights to safe drinking water.

Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century.

Most are Native Americans, and want to support the tribal sovereignty effort forcefully argued by the Standing Rock Sioux, whose land is adjacent to the pipeline being built. At one point the camp had about 10,000 people, including about 4,000 veterans who showed up in early December - just before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied a key easement needed to allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. After the Corps decision, Standing Rock chairman Dave Archambault asked protesters to go home. The camp's population now runs from 700 to 1,000, depending on the day, and many come from the nearby Standing Rock reservation where they live. Logistics are key for those still at the camp, located on federal land. Theron Begay, a Navajo journeyman who is a certified construction worker and heavy machine operator, has been put in charge of winterizing the camp. He is training volunteers to build structures that can withstand sub-zero temperatures and bitter winds, as well as compost toilets. Tribal leaders have said the camp may need to move if it wants to remain active. North Dakota's Governor Jack Dalrymple said in a Tuesday statement that he and Archambault recently met to discuss reducing tensions between the tribe and law enforcement. They are discussing reopening the nearby Backwater Bridge on state highway 1806, which has been blockaded since Oct. 27, when activists set vehicles on fire. Some still at the camp worry that if they leave, Energy Transfer Partners will restart construction. ETP asked a federal judge on Dec. 9 to overrule the government's decision and grant the easement. The judge declined that request; the parties are due back in court in February. The Army Corps is considering alternatives, which could take months. Eagles must keep Wentz at low risk Trump, who owned ETP stock through at least mid-2016, according to financial disclosure forms, could order the Army Corps to grant the permit.

Slate The Slatest Your News Companion Nov. 29 2016 3:55 PM North Dakota Police Want to Deny Standing Rock Protesters Food and Shelter By Josh Voorhees People gather at an encampment by the Missouri River, where hundreds of people have gathered to join the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's protest against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipe, near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, on September 3, 2016. The evacuation order came days after the federal government set a Dec. 5 deadline for the protesters to clear out, but neither state nor federal officials had said how, exactly, they planned to get everyone to comply. It appears we now have the answer: by making them too cold and hungry to stay put. Via Reuters: North Dakota law enforcement will begin to block supplies from reaching protesters at a camp near the construction site of an oil pipeline project in an effort to force demonstrators to vacate the area, officials said on Tuesday. Propane tanks also will be blocked because they have been used in attacks against law enforcement, she said. The supply blockade is theoretically a more peaceful way to get protesters to depart as winter approaches, but it remains an open question how authorities would respond if anyone tries to deliver supplies against government orders. While the order went into effect immediately, as of Tuesday morning no cars or trucks carrying supplies had yet been turned back, according to the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. If completed, the pipeline would carry 570,000 barrels of Bakken Crude oil per day from the Dakotas to Illinois. But for that to happen, it first needs to cross the Missouri River. Originally, the plan was for the pipeline to cross the river just north of Bismarck, but that route was scrapped over concerns about possible drinking water contamination. The engineers then rerouted the project beneath a lake near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation instead.

This may be because neither the state nor the Army Corps of Engineers wants to assume responsibility for removing the protectors, but this benefits the people that plan on continuing the protest throughout the winter season. By formally demanding a complete evacuation, the state is not held responsible for the deteriorating health of protesters caused by weather. Many speculate that this order will have little to no immediate effect on the water protectors, because federal officials would need to get involved if there were going to be any sort of removal. State and local officials are unable to forcibly remove people, except for when they are arresting them. This could prove to be a significant problem for protesters as their ability to access their own camps may dwindle. Since the investors behind the Dakota Access Pipeline lose more money as the protest goes on, drastic measures are being employed to strongly encourage protesters to abandon their efforts. However, a steadfast dedication to this cause that native people and other environmentalists are so passionate about has kept the effort going thus far.

The camp was established by protesters opposed to the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Activists in Minnesota have promised similar protests in the state if permits are granted for Enbridge's Line 3 replacement project. The lines were built in an era with no federal environmental law requiring studies or public hearings, keeping opposition to a minimum. That was never clearer than last year when what began as a small protest over the route of an oil pipeline near North Dakota's Standing Rock Reservation mushroomed into a monthslong international incident. Protesters ultimately lost that fight after Donald Trump became president. Many of those same activists, though, are focusing now on Minnesota where Enbridge Energy hopes to build a new pipeline to replace its aging Line 3. Activists are pressing Minnesota officials now to deny the permit and kill the project. State officials and company executives working to head off a confrontation say they're doing more than ever to listen to the concerns of those in the pipeline's potential path. That may not be enough to stop a confrontation. Similarities, differences The Standing Rock protests drew international attention. Thousands of tribal and environmental activists set up protest camps that were occupied for months. Dozens were injured in clashes with police. There are similarities between the Enbridge proposal and the Dakota Access line in North Dakota. They both travel very near current Indian reservations, and in both cases potential spills could do significant harm to important natural resources. The Dakota Access line travels underneath the Missouri River, from which the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe draws its drinking water. Line 3 would travel through the ancestral land of several Ojibwe tribes, where they hunt, fish and most importantly gather wild rice, a central part of traditional diet and culture. In North Dakota, while the tribe did voice its concerns to the company building the pipeline early in the process, it did not engage in the 13-month public process, said Julie Fedorchak, a North Dakota Public Service Commissioner. Not only are Native American activist groups such as Honor the Earth involved, but four tribal governments have formally intervened early in the proceedings. The state is more involved, as well. Enbridge has no permits for its Minnesota project. Smith's group went to court to get an environmental study required, and the state Supreme Court eventually agreed. It just does not think an oil pipeline should go through such environmentally sensitive areas as Enbridge proposes. The group has proposed an alternative route. Enbridge outreach Enbridge has also taken some cues from the Standing Rock protests. The company has added people to better reach out to tribes and others. One result of that outreach, he said, was a decision to reroute the pipeline around an important wild rice lake after the White Earth Nation voiced concerns. A big sticking point could be Enbridge's plan to decommission the existing Line 3, leave it in the ground, and build a new line along a different route, south of the existing pipeline corridor. That's a non-starter for White Earth tribal member Bill Paulson. Paulson has started a camp on the White Earth reservation he calls Camp Turtle Island. He said nine people are living there now who oppose the pipeline or who want to learn about Ojibwe culture. If a new pipeline is to be built, he said, he wants the old line removed and cleaned up, and a new one put in its place. Enbridge argues that removing the old line would actually create more environmental and safety risks, because it's located only 10 to 15 feet away from other operating pipelines in the company's mainline corridor, which currently carries 2.9 million barrels of oil every day from Canada. Last December Enbridge halted a meeting after protesters disrupted it. In February shots were fired at the front door and windows of Enbridge's office in town. The next attempts at finding that middle ground will occur this fall, when more public hearings on the pipeline, this time in front of an administrative law judge, are scheduled. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission expects to issue a final decision on the pipeline next April. If it's approved, the company says the pipeline could be operating by the end of 2019, assuming it's not disrupted by protests. Minnesota Public Radio News can be heard in Duluth at 100.5 FM or online at MPRNews.org. Forum News Service contributed to this report. It transports crude from the Alberta tar sands region in Canada across northern Minnesota to Enbridge's hub in Superior. It's part of Enbridge's Mainline system, a group of six pipelines that together carry about 2.9 million barrels of oil across the state. Because it's old, requires increasing maintenance, and isn't operating at full capacity. The pipeline has been operating for about 50 years. It's become corroded and cracked in places, requiring 950 excavations in the past 10 years. To maintain safety Enbridge has had to reduce the line's capacity to 390,000 barrels of oil per day. The company's proposed new line could carry up to 760,000 barrels per day, and potentially even more. Most of the oil passes through Minnesota to refineries around the Upper Midwest. About 400,000 barrels per day are diverted to two refineries in the Twin Cities. The current Line 3 runs at a diagonal from the northwest corner of the state, through the Leech Lake and Fond du Lac reservations, to Superior. The company's preferred route for its replacement line follows the existing Mainline to Clearbrook, Minn., but then cuts south to near Park Rapids, and then turns east to Superior. The proposed replacement line would travel 340 miles in Minnesota, about 60 miles longer than the current line. The public comment period ends on Monday. State regulators will release a final environmental impact statement on the pipeline in August. Then an administrative law judge will hold hearings on the proposal in a court-like process, and make a recommendation to the state Public Utilities Commission next February. The PUC plans to make a decision in April 2018. If it's approved, Enbridge has said a new pipeline could be operating by the end of 2019."}, {"URL": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/196566-support-the-dakota-pipeline-protests-this-thanksgiving-in-5-ways", "Timestamp": "20180918234715", "Sentences": "Personally, I believe there is a deep hypocrisy in tending to our travel and meal preparations this Thanksgiving while Native American leaders and protesters are getting sprayed with tear gas for defending the sanctity of water on a reservation. Although it would be pretty in keeping with the trends of American history. As the weather gets colder, the stakes of physical safety have only increased for the people protesting the Dakota Access oil pipeline, which would deliver approximately half a million barrels of oil between North Dakota and Illinois daily. The members of Standing Rock Sioux Nation and protesters have camped out where the pipeline is slated to cross the Missouri River since April. However, despite their tenacity, conditions intensified over the weekend, as the Morton County Police sprayed 400 protesters with tear gas on Sunday, amidst freezing temperatures. As a result, at least 17 protesters were hospitalized, which included a handful treated for hypothermia, according to demonstration organizers who spoke to the New York Daily News. As we gather this Thanksgiving either with friends or family, or possibly cuddle up in bed alone, there are a few ways we can lend support and solidarity to Standing Rock, even from afar. 1. The Sacred Stone Camp GoFundMe Account One of the most practical ways to lend your support to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation and their fellow protesters is by donating to the camp's official GoFundMe account. All of the donations go directly towards providing water, propane, food, and blankets for the camp. You can donate and leave a message here. 2. The Sacred Stone Legal Defense Fund The community of Standing Rock Sioux have filed a lawsuit and temporary restraining order against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for allowing the project to move forward without considering the environmental impact on the community. All of the donations to the Sacred Stone legal defense fund go toward supporting the lawsuit as well as supporting protesters arrest for taking direct action. You can donate here. 3. The Sacred Stone Camp Supply List If you're on a tighter budget or have an influx of useful camping and survival supplies, donating necessities from the Sacred Stone Camp supply list is a great way to help out. The supply list here is frequently updated and details supply needs ranging from walkie-talkies to cigarettes to battery packs. There's something for everyone to donate. 4. Call The White House Luckily for those of us not overladen with cash or supplies, there are many ways to express support that don't require an expendable income (although donations are particularly crucial right now). One act of solidarity everyone can do is call the White House at 202-456-1111 or 202)456-1414, and request that President Obama revoke the Army Corps of Engineers' permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline. 5. These are obviously just a handful of ways to express solidarity from faraway, and yet, making a few phone calls and some donations this Thanksgiving is a far better alternative to silence or complicity. We must stop the Dakota Access Pipeline and defend the rights of water protectors at Standing Rock. They are in it for the long haul. Donate what you can. we're hot off an election, it may be worth injecting a dose of political responsibility into this year's Thanksgiving celebration. despite their tenacity, conditions intensified over the weekend, as the Morton County Police sprayed 400 protesters with tear gas on Sunday, amidst freezing temperatures.

Despite new uncertainty over whether TransCanada, the builder of the Keystone XL pipeline will continue the project, longtime opponents in Nebraska aren't letting their guard down and neither are law enforcement officials who may have to react to protests if it wins approval. LINCOLN, Neb. Low oil prices and the high cost of extracting Canadian crude from oil sands are casting new doubts on Keystone XL as executives with the Canadian company that wants to build it face the final regulatory hurdle next week in Nebraska. The pipeline proposed in 2008 has faced dozens of state and federal delays, many of them prompted by environmental groups who ultimately persuaded President Barack Obama to deny federal approval in November 2015. After all that, a TransCanada executive raised eyebrows in the energy industry last week when he suggested that the pipeline developer doesn't know whether it will move forward with the project. Paul Miller, an executive vice president who is overseeing the project, told an investor call that company officials won't decide until late November or early December whether to start construction. The company has invited customers to bid for long-term contracts to ship oil on the pipeline. The bidding will run through September. An energy expert said the project has been delayed so long it may no longer make economic sense. The 1,179-mile pipeline would transport oil from tar sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, across Montana and South Dakota to Nebraska, where it would connect with existing pipelines that feed Texas Gulf Coast refineries. South Dakota and Montana regulators have approved the project, although there are legal challenges pending in both states. Only Nebraska has yet to give regulatory approval. The rest of the route for the oil to the Gulf would travel an existing pipeline in the network. Mason said the biggest economic problem is that synthetic crude from the Canadian deposits is considered a lower-value product because it tends to be heavier, and thus more expensive to refine into gasoline and jet fuel. It's also more expensive to extract than other oils. Producers have also found other ways to ship oil, primarily by train, and many are reluctant to sign long-term contracts with a pipeline that wouldn't go into operation for several more years, said Jeff Share, editor of the Houston-based Pipeline & Gas Journal, a leading industry publication. The five-member Nebraska Public Service Commission is supposed to decide by Nov. 23 whether the project serves the public's interests, based on evidence presented by attorneys in a formal legal proceeding beginning Monday and a series of public hearings held over the last few months. The elected commission is comprised of four Republicans and one Democrat. Environmental opposition to the project has persisted in Nebraska, where opponents say the pipeline would pass through the Sandhills, an ecologically fragile region of grass-covered sand dunes, and would cross the land of farmers and ranchers who don't want it. Nebraska law enforcement authorities already have had discussions with their counterparts in North Dakota about how that state handled widespread protests during construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock Indiana Reservation, said Cody Thomas, a Nebraska State Patrol spokesman. Protesters led by Native American tribes and environmental groups flocked to North Dakota last summer to rally against the Dakota Access Pipeline, and some camped out in bitter cold through early this year, prompting the state to send a large law enforcement contingent that sometimes skirmished with protesters. The pipeline was ultimately completed but legal challenges remain. Pipeline opponents in Nebraska said they are wary of TransCanada's recent statements and don't believe the company will surrender without a fight. To highlight his opposition, Carlson is installing solar panels on his land directly in the path of the proposed pipeline. If the Nebraska commission approves the route, TransCanada can initiate legal proceedings under eminent domain to gain access to the land of holdout property owners. TransCanada has secured agreement with roughly 90 percent of Nebraska landowners along the route. The company said that if it decides to go ahead with the project, it would need six to nine months to start doing some of the staging of the construction crews followed by two years of construction."}, {"URL": "http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/judge-denies-request-halt-dakota-pipeline-work", "Timestamp": "20180918224905", "Sentences": "The tribes requested the temporary injunction last week after Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners got federal permission to lay pipe under a Missouri River reservoir in North Dakota. The tribes say the pipeline would endanger their cultural sites and water supply. They added a religious freedom component to their case last week by arguing that clean water is necessary to practice the Sioux religion and that the mere presence of the pipeline renders the water impure. Energy Transfer Partners received final approval from the Army last week to lay pipe under the reservoir and to complete the 1,200-mile pipeline, which would move North Dakota oil to a shipping point in Illinois. Drilling work began immediately under Lake Oahe, which is the water source for both tribes. Work under Lake Oahe had been held up in the courts until President Donald Trump last month instructed the Army Corps of Engineers to advance construction. The Army is involved because its engineering branch manages the river and its system of hydroelectric dams, which is owned by the federal government. The drilling work is expected to take about two months. The full pipeline system could be operational within three months. Energy Transfer Partners maintains that the pipeline is safe and disputes that cultural sites have been affected. But an encampment near the construction in southern North Dakota drew thousands of protesters last year in support of the tribes, leading to occasional clashes with law enforcement and nearly 700 arrests. The camp has thinned to fewer than 300 people, but law enforcement officers continue to maintain a presence in the area. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The tribe fears the line could destroy sacred sites during construction and that a future oil spill might pollute its drinking water. Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II told Reuters the tribe was aware of the safety record of Energy Transfer, but declined to elaborate. Sunoco Logistics is one of the largest pipeline operators in the United States. Sunoco acknowledged the data and told Reuters it had taken measures to reduce its spill rate. This significantly cut the amount of barrels lost during incidents, he said. It highlighted the need for reform in the way companies building infrastructure consult with Native American tribes. HIGH SPILL RATE Reuters analyzed data that companies are obliged to disclose to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) when they suffer spills and found that Sunoco leaked crude from onshore pipelines at least 203 times over the last six years. PHMSA data became more detailed in 2010. In its examination, Reuters tallied leaks in the past six years along dedicated onshore crude oil lines and excluded systems that carry natural gas and refined products. The Sunoco data include two of its pipeline units, the West Texas Gulf and Mid-Valley Pipeline. That made it the operator with the highest number of crude leak incidents, ahead of at least 190 recorded by Enterprise Products Partners (EPD.N) and 167 by Plains All American Pipeline (PAA.N), according to the spill data reported to PHMSA, which is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Enterprise said it has comprehensive safety and integrity programs in place and that many spills happened at its terminals. Sunoco and Enterprise both said most leaks take place within company facilities and are therefore contained. Plains All American did not respond to a request for comment. Slideshow (5 Images) To be sure, most pipeline spills are small and pipelines are widely seen as a safer way to move fuel than alternatives such as rail. Sunoco said it found that crude lines not in constant use were a significant source of leaks, so it had shut or repaired some of those arteries. While total pipeline incidents have increased by 31 percent in the last five years, large spills of 500 barrels or more are down by 32 percent over the same time, the report said. Sunoco accounted for about 8 percent of the more than 2,600 reported liquids pipeline leaks in the past six years in the United States. SAFETY OVERHAUL The company has made previous efforts to improve safety, a former Sunoco employee who declined to be identified said. It overhauled safety culture after a spill in 2000, and did so again another in 2005 that dumped some 6,000 barrels of crude into the Kentucky River from its Mid-Valley Pipeline. Sunoco acknowledged that some of its pipeline equipment dates back to the 1950s. In September, Sunoco received another corrective measure for its newly constructed Permian Express II line in Texas, which leaked 800 barrels of oil earlier this month.

A Lakota Sioux man sang prayers, cutting through the winter air in a mournful, high-pitched chant. The mood was solemn. Earlier that day, the US Army Corps of Engineers granted the controversial Dakota Access oil pipeline an easement to pass beneath Lake Oahe and the Missouri River, north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Since the middle of 2016, thousands of Native Americans have been fighting to prevent the pipeline's completion. In the final days of Barack Obama's presidency the White House put construction on hold pending further assessments, and for a moment the protesters believed they had won. Crowds celebrated with fireworks on the snow-swamped prairie of North Dakota. Within days of taking office, he issued an executive memorandum on 24 January calling for the pipeline to proceed. Two weeks later, the president's order was obliged, and the Corps granted the easement. For the Sioux people who opposed this venture and the coalition of 200 tribal nations that joined them, this development is a crushing blow. For those who have been campaigning for the pipeline, including workers unions, oil and gas advocates and some Republican politicians like Sarah Palin, this was a pivotal victory. The last 1.5 mile (2.4 km) stretch of the pipeline is expected to be completed in less than 90 days. Activist groups have mobilised in an attempt to reverse the decision, planning direct actions in New York, Chicago and hundreds of other locations across the US. Campaigners have already enjoyed some success. A legal challenge against the pipeline has also been mounted. A lawsuit has been ongoing between the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River tribes and the federal government since September 2016. The plaintiffs filed a request for a temporary halt to pipeline construction in federal court in Washington DC on 9 February. Image copyright Charlie Northcott Image caption The Dakota Access pipeline controversy has helped foster an unprecedented alliance of indigenous nations They argued that the Army Corp of Engineers was wrong to terminate an Environmental Impact Statement they were compiling, which had been initiated by President Obama, but was swiftly shelved once President Trump assumed office. The tribes may also request a summary judgement on their lawsuit, which would fast-track their case and compel the judge to make a ruling ahead of schedule - either in favour of the tribes or in favour of the government. By what means remains unclear. Although as many as 10,000 people were camped out in North Dakota in solidarity with Standing Rock in December, the Native American camps have shrunk considerably since. Between 300 and 500 people are currently living near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball Rivers in three camps: Oceti Sakowin, Sacred Stone and Rosebud Sicangu.

The original camps could be vacated within a matter of weeks. Theda New Brest, a member of the Blackfoot Confederacy, also believes the Standing Rock tribal alliance faces difficult days ahead.

J. Weston Phippen Nov 24, 2016 Protesters stand off with police during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline. On Sunday night, 400 people marched toward a bridge that has become the frontline of this fight, where two burned-out trucks and a stretch of coiled barbed wire divided the Standing Rock Sioux Nation from deputies. Protesters started fires on the road by the bridge. Deputies fired volleys of tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd; as the temperature registered 20 degrees Fahrenheit, deputies blasted protesters with a water cannon mounted to an armored vehicle, sending about two dozen people to the hospital with hypothermia. Protesters also say a 21-year-old woman, Sophia Wilansky, was hit in the arm with a concussion grenade, and the impact mangled her arm so badly she may need amputation. They said protesters had thrown stones and logs at deputies, injuring at least one. At issue is the 1,170-mile pipeline that would cross hundreds of waterways, wetlands, private parcels, and span four states, funneling half a million barrels of crude oil every day between North Dakota and Illinois. In North Dakota, the pipeline is on private property that lies close to tribal land, although it needs permission from the Army Corps of Engineers to pass below the Missouri River. Standing Rock, supported by environmentalists and other Native American tribes, has challenged the project in court and has protested at the site since last spring. Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the project, is standing firm. The Obama administration has unsuccessfully tried to find a solution. The pipeline project had ramped up quickly; only two years ago it was still a concept. The land originally belonged to the Sioux, and the 1868 U.S. Treaty of Fort Laramie set aside this land for them all the way down to the Black Hills in South Dakota, as my colleague Robinson Meyer wrote this summer. The U.S. changed its mind after rumors of gold in the area spread. Then in 1958, the U.S. needed more land to build the Oahe Dam, below which the pipeline is set to cross. Standing Rock says the Army Corps never included the tribe in the surveying process, that permitting was rushed, and, because Energy Transfer Partners relied on old surveys of the land, the pipeline has plowed through sacred ancient sites. A federal judge in Washington, D.C., halted construction, but in September the court ruled that Energy Transfer Partners could proceed. Almost immediately the U.S. Department of Justice and the Department of Interior intervened and ordered construction to pause. This is where the situation is at currently, with the federal government intervening and Energy Transfer Partners vowing to finish the project. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple is pressuring the Army Corps to let the the project continue. And because along with the change of season this year comes a change in the presidential administration, this seems likely to happen. Soon the snow will come to Standing Rock, as will Canadian winds that dip below zero degrees and carry freezing rain and sleet. The protesters have raised millions of dollars to fund their protest, and the tents and teepees they spent the summer in are giving way to bunkhouses built of two-by-fours and makeshift sheds with solar panel roofs.

A group of protesters had blocked a private road used by workers building the Dakota Access pipeline across his North Dakota county, halting the construction work. Eleven protesters were arrested that day. What began as a couple of small protest camps on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation eventually swelled into an international incident. Now the sheriff thinks Nebraska will be next for a similar mega demonstration. With the recent resurrection of the Keystone XL pipeline project by President Donald Trump, the group that led the opposition to the pipeline, Bold Nebraska, has pledged to renew its fight. On its website, the grass-roots group is not only asking pipeline opponents to write letters and attend rallies and court hearings, but also to risk arrest. Thousands of Native Americans and environmentalists poured in to protest there. But Kleeb said her group wants to be ready if the pipeline is eventually approved in the state. To be sure, such actions are probably a long way off. A federal lawsuit filed to block the Keystone XL project might take months to resolve. And TransCanada Corp. must gain approval from the State of Nebraska for its proposed route across the Cornhusker State, a process that will carry into the fall. Additional lawsuits to block the use of eminent domain to obtain right of way easements for the 36-inch pipeline will most assuredly follow. It might take two years to cross all of those hurdles and start construction. Law enforcement and county officials interviewed say there have been some discussions about what might be coming, but they declined to say whether any protest-control training is underway. So far, local pipeline events have been peaceful, said Radcliff, who believes any protests are months away. The issue of protests and preparations has come up before. In 2013, Bold Nebraska denounced TransCanada after it discovered, through a public records request, that the pipeline company had made presentations to Nebraska law enforcement officials about environmental protests and how anti-terrorism laws could be used to jail demonstrators. A TransCanada spokesman, in 2013, said the company was only trying to show law enforcement officials what tactics protesters had used elsewhere. The presentation showed how demonstrators had chained themselves to heavy equipment and built treehouses in the path of the pipeline route to slow construction. Bold Nebraska has erected some structures on the pipeline route that eventually could become flashpoints for protests. The farm, which is on the pipeline route, also was the site of a benefit concert in 2014 by singers Neil Young and Willie Nelson. The pipeline would pass near the reservation, which is just across the Nebraska state line. Nine Poncas died en route, including a young daughter of Chief Standing Bear. But Kleeb emphasized it may not come to that. She expressed confidence that the state will either reject the pipeline route or do what Bold Nebraska has suggested: move the pipeline route to parallel the existing Keystone pipeline that runs through eastern Nebraska, thus avoiding the disruption of new properties. TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said Friday that no one wants to see a repeat of incidents like those in North Dakota. Guard dogs attacked protesters, demonstrators were doused with water in freezing weather and police were spit on and pelted with rocks and debris. Sheriff Kirchmeier said that several other states, including South Dakota, have asked him to relay what he learned from the Standing Rock protests, and said that eventually he expects to talk with those from Nebraska. In North Dakota, both his county and the state declared emergencies so they could utilize emergency funds to buy riot gear and cover the costs of officers who came from other states, including Nebraska. Kirchmeier said some tactical lessons were learned in confronting protesters, but he declined to share them. The sheriff said it also is important to keep lines of communication open with protest leaders so each side knows what to expect. That became difficult at Standing Rock, Kirchmeier said, because the protest got so large, so fast, that several divergent groups emerged. Most wanted to peacefully protest, but a small group wanted to disrupt and do damage. Only 6 percent of the 670 or so people arrested were from North Dakota, he said.

The announcement puts politics over the rule of law. When Donald Trump enters the White House, he should quickly reverse this political decision and allow construction to resume. The pipeline, which passes near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota, provoked sharp dissent from Indian leaders worried about its potential effect on water supplies and sacred Indian land. Watch On Forbes: Lesson From The Colonial Outage, Let The Koch Bros. Build More Pipelines The 1,170-mile project is designed to carry about 500,000 barrels of crude oil a day from North Dakota to Illinois. The Corps reviewed the remaining path, as required under the Clean Water Act, the Rivers and Harbors Act, the National Historic Preservation Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. This past July, after years of extensive review, the Corps concluded that the pipeline would have no significant adverse impact on the environment. Numerous state agencies reached similar conclusions. Based on its finding, the Corps issued all approvals necessary for construction. Shortly thereafter, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued in federal district court in Washington, D.C. to stop construction and to reverse the Corps' decision. The Tribe's lawsuit spawned protests, sometimes violent, on federal land near the construction site. The Department of Justice, representing the Corps in court, denied the Tribe's claims and argued that construction should be allowed to go forward. The Corps' Justice Department attorneys repeatedly assured the courts that the Corps had fully complied with NEPA's requirements and other federal laws, including the National Historic Preservation Act. Activists walk through the snow at Oceti Sakowin camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on December 5, 2016 outside Cannon Ball, North Dakota. (The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently upheld that ruling). Construction should have resumed shortly thereafter. Pipeline workers should have been allowed to enter the federal lands of the Missouri River under which the pipeline would run. The press release cited no basis for its order and publicly undercut the Corps and its Justice Department lawyers who had been repeatedly defending the Corps' determinations on their merits. Ordering the Corps to abandon its well-founded positions for the sake of political expediency is wrong. Interested private parties should be able to rely on the Corps' merits-based decision defended by the Justice Department and confirmed by the courts. Contrary to fundamental rule of law precepts, the firm's work should not depend on arbitrary political decisions to change the rules after the fact. President Trump should waste no time in reversing this political decision, restoring the government's credibility and upholding the rule of law. He served under Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W.

The project to build the 1,900km Dakota Access oil pipeline across six US states has prompted massive protests from Native American activists at the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Vibeke Larsen, president of the Sami parliament, said the pension fund announced the move when she arrived at a meeting in Oslo to discuss Dakota Access. Although they are seen as one people, there are several kinds of Sami, and their rights differ significantly depending on the nation state they live in, according to the United Nations. In common with Native Americans in the US, the Sami have over the years protested against mining operations and mineral resource prospecting on their land. The Standing Rock Sioux say that the Dakota Access pipeline crosses sacred land and threatens their water supply from the Missouri river. Their efforts to halt or divert the pipeline became an international rallying cry for indigenous and environmental activists last year. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The protest at Standing Rock against the Dakota Access pipeline has drawn solidarity from around the world. But Larsen alerted the investment fund to a report earlier this month by the UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, which concluded the tribes affected by the pipeline had not been consulted sufficiently. Opponents of Dakota Access have also waged a divestment campaign against the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners. Using the slogan Defund DAPL, activists have also urged individuals and institutions to move money out of companies involved in the project. Larsen believes KLP realised the case was serious when the parliament began writing to them. As non state-owned businesses, they had not been targeted by the Sami parliament, a parliament spokesman says. As indigenous people who are themselves protected under international conventions, the Sami campaigners believe that their voice can have an impact far beyond their numbers, said Larsen.

State officials issued an order on Monday for activists to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, located on US Army Corps of Engineers land near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, citing harsh weather conditions.

The Army Corps, citing safety concerns, has ordered the evacuation of the primary protest camp by December 5th, but said it would not forcibly remove people from the land. Local law enforcement said on Tuesday they planned a blockade of the camp, but local and state officials later retreated, saying they would check vehicles only for certain prohibited supplies such as propane, and possibly issue fines. Mr Dalrymple said on Wednesday that state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and there had been no plans to block food or other supplies from the camp. He also warned protesters that while emergency responders would try to reach anyone in need, that would be contingent on weather conditions. That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps.

The 1,172-mile oil pipeline, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), is in its final stages of construction apart from a section tunneling under Lake Oahe, a half-mile from the reservation. The pipeline will allow half a million barrels of oil to flow from North Dakota to Illinois each day. A snowstorm and 45mph winds have pounded the nearby Standing Rock Indian reservation this week They also contend that millions of people who live downstream from the pipeline are at risk of crude oil leaks and spills. This week, North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said it was 'probably not feasible' to reroute the pipeline - which was originally intended to run north of the city of Bismarck, around 50 miles from the Sioux tribe's land. There are other smaller, offshoot camps - Sacred Stone, Rosebud and Red Warrior. The camp was founded by a Sioux family in April but now non-native activists outweigh Native Americans. Hundreds of tribes are represented at the camp and their flags line the perimeter and fly from individual dwellings. At one point, numbers were believed to have swelled to around 8,000 but snowstorms and freezing conditions have driven out many who were ill-equipped to withstand the conditions.

People are being drawn to the sacred fires burning at the camp both as a constant source of heat and to listen to drumming, prayers and Native American songs. Vats of free, hot tea are positioned outside a number of tents as an aid to the 'camp cough' which many activists have developed after months in the cold.

The Standing Rock tribe filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that the US Army Corps of Engineers failed to properly consult them. The lawsuit alleged that the Corps were in breach of the Clean Water Act by allowing the pipe to go so close to their reservation. 'The pipeline has destroyed 86 documented burial sites but they are treating us like domestic terrorists. 'We are the original environmental activists. We have been protecting water and the land for generations and now in the 21st century, we are doing the same. At the camp, preparations are underway to bed in for the rest of the winter amid calls by tribal elders for protesters to remain calm. On Thursday, Faith Spotted Eagle, from the Ihanktonwan Dakota Territory in South Dakota, urged activists not to engage in direct actions against the pipeline workers or authorities which could risk the Treaties of Native American tribes. She asked that those at the camp follow the advice of the Oceti Sakowin leadership and remain in ceremonial prayer. But a violent flare-up last month has left many activists feeling the need to be prepared. Water cannons were sprayed on demonstrators in freezing conditions.

Protesters say she was struck by a police flash grenade, while police have suggested that protesters may have caused the explosion. According to the Morton County Sheriff's Department, more than 500 people have been arrested in the last month. One woman has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly trying to shoot dead a cop as one of the camps was cleared. According to the Morton County State Attorney, Red Fawn Falls, 37, fired three shots at police officers and had to have her gun wrestled out of her arm by cops as she was arrested. Falls allegedly hit one officer in the knee which caused it to 'explode' before she was wrestled to the ground. She has now been charged with attempted murder among other offences and faces 20 years in jail. On Thursday, the Morton County Sheriff's Department released video of two female deputies describing how protesters attempted to use ropes and grappling hooks to break the wiring set up to stop trespassing on private property. According to the sheriff's department, the protestors, who identified themselves as veterans, threatened the female deputies saying law enforcement officers 'should be ready for what's coming'. Lana Jack, of the Celilowy'am tribe in Oregon, is in charge of coordinating the donations. She sounded a note of warning after the blizzard this week left many on the camp in dire situations. 'For three days we didn't have any donations, we were completely cut off. We have not been able to keep people warm.

She added: 'We were totally lacking but our people have come together. But we don't have the capacity to take care of more people. We need heavy tents, lumber and propane.' Lana claimed that three trucks had been confiscated by police while bringing supplies to Standing Rock from Bismarck. On Tuesday, state officials said anyone bringing prohibited items into the main protest camp would be fined. There had been threats of a physical blockade on the way to the camp but authorities seem to have retreated from that plan. Instead officers will stop vehicles which appear to be heading to Standing Rock with building supplies and food. that there is a concerted effort going on to make sure people are prepared.

The highest court in Nebraska now hears a case on landowners seeking compensation from pipeline planner TransCanada. Bold Nebraska, an organization that's steered a multi-year campaign against the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada, said 40 landowners are challenging eminent domain proceedings launched by TransCanada two years ago. The pipeline's progress was stimulated when U.S. President Donald Trump took office last year and used the power of the executive office to facilitate North American oil and gas infrastructure. RELATED Canada agrees to monitor oil sands impact A decision drafted in 2015 by the State Department under U.S. President Barack Obama said there were questions about the necessity for additional North American pipeline capacity given uncertainties about the future growth of Canadian oil sands production. Referencing long-standing concerns about the Sandhills region in Nebraska, some of which were the source of legal battles, regulators on the Nebraska Public Service Commission sided against the preferred route for Keystone XL and instead voted for an alternate route that allayed ecological concerns. The Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality published a report more than three years ago on the need to avoid the Sandhills area. RELATED TransCanada: 20 percent of spilled Keystone oil recovered TransCanada is already facing market headwinds given the lack of shipper commitments for the pipeline. The Nebraska Supreme Court takes up the landowner hearing Tuesday morning.

In a decision on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg denied the tribe's motion for a preliminary injunction against the pipeline company. The tribes are arguing that the completion of the pipeline construction just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation endangers their drinking water source, part of the Missouri River called Lake Oahe, and that the pipeline has damaged cultural sites. The Two-Way Key Moments In The Dakota Access Pipeline Fight The pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, has been drilling under Lake Oahe for weeks, and said oil could start flowing through that section of the pipeline as early as next week. Explaining he believed the tribes were unlikely to prevail in their lawsuit at this point, Boasberg denied their request to halt construction on the pipeline, or stop oil from flowing through it once it is complete. The plaintiffs have not announced any change to their legal approach to the case. In late February, North Dakota's governor ordered people camped near the construction site, some of whom had been demonstrating against the pipeline for months, to leave the largest encampment, citing flooding concerns as snow melted. The Two-Way Protesters Leave Dakota Access Pipeline Area; Some Stay And Are Arrested Others opposed to the pipeline have continued to protest elsewhere in the country. Over the weekend, a group of people gathered outside Trump Tower in New York City, some carrying signs advocating for the rights of indigenous Americans, and others expressing anger about President Trump's decision to allow the pipeline to go forward.

DAKOTA ACCESS Government, tribe slam company's 'legal fallacy' Ellen M. Gilmer, E&E News reporter Published: Monday, January 9, 2017 Dakota Access litigation lit up again last week as the Obama administration and Standing Rock Sioux Tribe tried to block legal maneuvering by the pipeline company. Lawyers for the Army Corps of Engineers on Friday urged a federal court in Washington to reject a request from Dakota Access LLC to resolve the case in its favor. The pipeline, which could transport 570,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois, was held up for months last year while thousands of tribal and environmental advocates protested against it. The Obama administration ultimately decided against granting the final approval needed for the oil line to cross a section of the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota (Energywire, Dec. 5, 2016). A win for the company would be monumental, allowing the pipeline to cross the river right away. But many experts have said it's a long shot (Energywire, Dec. 6, 2016). The company's request put both the administration and the tribe on defense. In a brief Friday, government lawyers slammed Dakota Access' theory, arguing that no-impact findings earlier this year dealt only with pipeline approvals under the Clean Water Act and Rivers and Harbors Act. The easement needed to cross Army Corps-managed property is a separate consideration governed by the Mineral Leasing Act. The Standing Rock Sioux and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, which is also a party to the litigation, urged Obama appointee Judge James Boasberg to toss the company's request.

Emergency crews can also choose not to send ambulances to the area. The governor cited the winter weather and threat to safety as justification. But the Justice Department stepped in, saying that the permits need more review, and construction has stopped temporarily. The Army Corps of Engineers, which needs to grant an easement to the company constructing the pipeline, is reviewing the case now. On December 4, 2,000 veterans plan to join them to act as human shields, protecting activists from police. There are roughly 5,000 activists at the site now. advertisement The months of protest have succeeded in impacting the companies building the pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners, which oversees the pipeline project, promised oil companies that the pipeline would be completed by January 1. An expert who reviewed the environmental assessment prepared by the Army Corps says that one of the biggest risks may come from the fact that landslides can happen in parts of the path of the pipeline. There are many other ways that pipelines can spill oil, including corrosion or damage to pipes that can happen if construction is rushed. And spills happen all the time; more than 200 spills have happened in 2016 alone. In September, a ruptured pipeline in Alabama leaked more than 300,000 gallons of oil. In October, a storm damaged a pipeline in Pennsylvania, spilling 55,000 gallons. Tar sands oil, which sunk to the bottom of the river, is even harder to remediate than a typical oil spill. It owned the pipeline that ruptured in Pennsylvania in October, and has had more than 200 leaks since 2010. In North Dakota, the original route of the pipeline was planned to pass Bismarck, but that was rejected in part because it threatened drinking water supplies there. The pipeline is also about the bigger issues of tribal sovereignty, and centuries of land grabs from the Sioux. And, like the Keystone XL Pipeline, which Trump plans to revive, it raises questions about whether pipelines should be built in an era of climate change. But Obama could still help reroute or stop it now: Bernie Sanders has suggested that the president should designate Standing Rock a national monument. advertisement advertisement advertisement About the author Adele Peters is a staff writer at Fast Company who focuses on solutions to some of the world's largest problems, from climate change to homelessness.

Iverson said that the use of the fire hose as a water canon was justified. Iverson said that the road closure would not hamper medical services to Standing Rock protesters if needed. However, Iverson said that rubber bullets have not been used against the Dakota Access protesters and he cannot comment on the potential lethality of weapons including fire hoses, sponge rounds and bean bag rounds. Attempting to breach the police line results in action taken by law enforcement. Photos and videos show officers using less-than lethal rounds against protesters, including the shooting of an unarmed indigenous man off his horse, bruising his ribs. Reports from the Oceti Sakowin camp have said that another woman was injured so badly by police that her arm may need to be amputated. Weeks ago, police and protesters agreed that the bridge would be cleared as soon as possible, but protesters are frustrated with the delays from law enforcement in doing so. Protesters allegedly set fire to the two trucks on Oct. 27, which to this day, many of them and their leaders deny. Police charged all of those arrested that day with attempting to endanger by fire or explosives, a felony charge, because of the fires. They also gave a New York journalist the same charges. Dallas Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network has made several attempts to quell rumors in the camp that police surveillance aircraft have sprayed protesters with mustard gas. Police have routinely said that protesters have used weapons against them, including: guns, bows and arrows, Molotov cocktails and slingshots. Red Fawn Fallis was arrested for allegedly trying to shoot officers. The weapon was confiscated. Clear evidence, including video footage, shows DAPL workers have made attempts to kill and critically injure protesters. Police have said little these events and little seems to be done about stopping workers from engaging with the protesters, protecting the safety of the protesters. Iverson said one officer was hit in the head with a rock during the Nov. 20 protest action, but the extent of his injuries are unknown. Iverson said he was unaware of the Nov. 20 action did any further damage to the bridge.

About 250 veterans gathered about a mile from the main camp for a meeting with organizer Wes Clark Jr., the son of former Democratic presidential candidate Gen. Wesley Clark. The group had said about 2,000 veterans were coming, but it wasn't clear how many actually arrived. Authorities moved a blockade from the north end of the Backwater Bridge with the conditions that protesters stay south of it and come there only if there is a prearranged meeting. Authorities also asked protesters not to remove barriers on the bridge, which they have said was damaged in the late October conflict that led to several people being hurt, including a serious arm injury. Cars waiting to get into the camp Sunday afternoon were backed up for more than a half-mile.

Small packs of dogs dart about, tussling in the snow, their barks drowned out by the incessant whine of a snowmobile that wends its way through the slushy mess. Everything is white, brown, gray. The only flashes of color come from weatherworn tribal flags, banners that were jubilantly raised last summer and now, some in tatters, snap to and fro in the ever-changing wind. One day soon, all of this will be gone: the tepees packed away, the yurts pulled down, the abandoned tents and sleeping bags and boxes of belongings scraped up by bulldozers into waiting dumpsters and hauled off to landfills. Josh Dayrider, a member of the Blackfeet Nation of Montana, has been at the camp off and on since early last year. We woke the world up by showing how the oil companies treat the land and the people. Tanya Olsen stood next to her mini-camper, pulling out a mattress that had been soaked by rising waters. She arrived here in November. I knew very little about pipelines. But what really caught my attention was the mistreatment of the Natives here. As she prepares to leave, Olsen says she takes solace from the impact the year-long protest has had on tribes. The yell is picked up and repeated from different corners of the camp for a minute or so, echoing up to a snowy bluff overlooking the encampment where state and local police sit in a fleet of law enforcement vehicles, monitoring comings and goings. Quiet returns. But he arrived at Reagan National Airport to learn that final approval had been granted while he was en route. Their teacher, Kim Warren, a tribal member, said she made regular visits to the main camp in the fall, believing the protest was a necessary and valuable one. As legal options dwindle and the prospect of a completed pipeline that could begin transporting more than 500,000 barrels of crude oil a day in two to three months appears more likely, its opponents are taking stock. Dallas Goldtooth has been one of the leading voices of the protest, filing regular Facebook Live feeds to share the most recent developments. An environmental activist who is an Isanti Dakota from Minnesota, he wants supporters to know that their participation has not been in vain, no matter what the outcome. The fight never stops. It builds. It moves. Some activists have called for more protesters to come out to the site, but the Standing Rock tribe has discouraged that, asking that opposition be directed at the local level and at a March 10 march planned for Native American rights in Washington. The tribe welcomed the 200 or so Native tribes that gathered here in late summer and fall to help their cause, and it welcomed the national and international support that followed.

Submit More: 7 history lessons that explain tribal objections to DAPL Citing increased violence between protesters and law enforcement and the increasingly harsh winter conditions, the Army Corps said it decided to close its land to the protesters who have been there since early April. Col. John Henderson, the Army Corps' district commander, asked Archambault in a letter to tell members of his tribe, along with supporters there, to move from the property north of the Cannonball River. The letter was sent after a protester's arm was severely injured by a concussion grenade that protesters contend was thrown by local law enforcement. Police also sprayed protesters with a fire hose in near-freezing conditions. The free speech zone the Army Corps has proposed south of the Cannonball River is slightly more than 41 acres and provides clearer jurisdiction for police, fire and medical units. The letter makes it clear that the land will be closed to the public and that anyone who enters it will be considered trespassing and could face prosecution under federal, state and local laws. Saturday, two prominent North Dakota politicians said the onus was on the federal government to close the camps. More than 400 people attended the rally to support those law enforcement officers who had been dealing with the protests. The demonstration wasn't in support of or opposed to the pipeline, organizers told NBC station KFYR of Bismarck. We want unity. Bismarck police arrested more than 30 people at a mall Friday for alleged criminal trespassing involving the protesters. About 100 protesters had gathered to generate a prayer circle, which police said disrupted Black Friday shopping. Thousands of people have flocked to North Dakota to aid the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, who believe the pipeline could contaminate their water source, the Missouri River, and desecrate the tribe's sacred sites. The company behind the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, says that it has taken measures to prevent such leaks, that the pipeline is far safer than transporting oil with trucks or trains, and that there is no archaeological significance to the area.

The pipeline could carry up to 570,000 barrels per day of fracked oil from North Dakota to Illinois. It would cross 200 waterways, including under the Missouri River, upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe reservation in North Dakota (which draws its drinking water from that river). Presently, there are about 3,000 land defenders gathered on Standing Rock territory blocking the construction of the pipeline. Council of Canadians organizer AJ Klein, who was at today's protest, tells us that at least two people closed their TD accounts during the action this morning. Water campaigner Emma Luis was also at the protest. We employ due diligence in our lending and investing activities relating to energy production. We also work with our customers, community and environment groups, and energy clients to better understand key issues of concern, and to promote informed dialogue. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved the construction of the pipeline on July 25, construction began on August 10, and the water protection protests began on August 15. On September 9, the U.S. government announced that it was temporarily halting work on the project within 30 kilometres east or west of Lake Oahe, explaining that the concerns raised by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe necessitated a reconsideration of previous decisions regarding the site. Energy Transfer Partners had previously vowed the 1,700 kilometre long pipeline will be completed by the end of this year.

The Army Corps did Trump's bidding, granting a permit for Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) to drill under Lake Oahe along the Missouri River, without bothering to complete the environmental impact statement it had earlier mandated. ETP got started immediately with drilling in an area that is sacred land of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. The company brags that it can have the DAPL operational within 30 days. The Army Corps followed up its drilling permit with orders to clear encampments from land it controls along the Cannonball River. Meanwhile, the water protectors who remain at the Standing Rock camps have faced intensified repression from law enforcement agencies at all levels, from federal to local. Taking a stand at Standing Rock SINCE TRUMP'S announcement in January, supporters of the Standing Rock water protectors, including military veterans, have tried to go back to previously established protest camps, or set up new ones. But some veterans told the media they were being targeted by law enforcement. Likewise, longtime water protectors have been picked up and charged with serious federal charges that could lead to many years in prison. At the beginning of February, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) and local authorities arrested about 74 people who were setting up another camp on land claimed by ETP. The BIA has agreed to work with other law enforcement agencies to make sure that the area is cleared by the February 22 deadline. Clearly, the BIA and other authorities aren't concerned about the damage--in the form of waste, debris and worse--that a completed DAPL will do to the community. Meanwhile, the company is escalating its propaganda offensive, with ETP Executive Vice President Joey Mahmoud submitting written testimony to Congress that accused the water protectors of violence. The irony, of course, is that ETP and the U.S. government are invading Lakota treaty territory to build the pipeline--and their private security goons, along with police, have been the ones prepared to use violence to get their way. IN JANUARY, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Council decided to call for all protest camps to be cleared and said it would request federal aid on this basis. Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II, who previously welcomed the mass show of solidarity that swelled the encampments, now insists that the fight must take place in the courts. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has filed a new lawsuit to call on a temporary halt of the pipeline. This followed a recent court ruling that threw out a case calling for a restraining order on ETP. The legal strategy of the tribal council has caused a split among water protectors. Many of the Indigenous people who have been resisting the pipeline called Archambault's direction a mistake. After all, as they argue, if any people in the U.S. know that the courts can't be relied on to dispense justice, it's Native Americans. The federal government has been historically unfaithful in honoring treaty rights with any number of Indigenous nations. Besides, the courts had nothing to do with the water protectors' previous victories at Standing Rock, including a halt to construction in December, just hours before a previously threatened eviction date. With the showdown looming, tens of thousands of people poured into the Oceti Sakowin camp, including representatives of hundreds of Indigenous nations and a huge delegation of military veterans, Native and non-Native alike. This mobilization was the culmination of an inspiring show of solidarity that built over months of action. Ultimately, the Army Corps, then under the control of the Obama administration, refused to grant the necessary easement to drill under Lake Oahe, pending a study on the environmental impact of the pipeline. The spirit of solidarity with Standing Rock has continued into the new year, despite the contemptuous actions of the new Trump administration. Hundreds of solidarity actions took place around the country during a week of action from February 12-17, focused mainly on a call to pressure financial institutions to divest from DAPL. Some localities have started to divest from Wells Fargo, a large financer of the DAPL. On February 1, the Seattle City Council Finance Committee voted unanimously to pull funds from the mega-bank for its support for the pipeline. Despite the Tribal Council call for water protectors to leave, veterans mobilized again to the resistance camps at Standing Rock in an effort to stand in the way of another eviction order. But it is a much smaller mobilization that remains on the site today. Moreover, this time, Donald Trump is president, and he has made it abundantly clear that he will keep pipeline projects like DAPL going by any means necessary. His presidency has been weakened by major clashes with sections of the ruling political and business establishment. But when it comes to escalating production of fossil fuels, no matter what the cost to people or the planet, the ruling class is united. The about-face by the Army Corps in withdrawing its own order for an environmental impact study and the even more aggressive actions of law enforcement show that the Trump administration is able to make itself felt. The possibility for state repression and violence on February 22 is real. But the struggle at Standing Rock is part of a centuries-old fight, and it won't end with bullying executive order for Donald Trump. No matter what happens on February 22, we need to support the fight against DAPL and every pipeline and against the attacks on Indigenous sovereignty under the Trump regime.

An announcement in Nebraska is expected on Monday. The pipeline company, TransCanada, said in a statement that the South Dakota leak was detected around 6 a.m. local time on Thursday. The pipeline was shut down, and the cause of the leak was under investigation.

More than a million gallons leaked from a pipeline into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan in 2010, and 50,000 gallons of oil gushed into the Yellowstone River in Montana in 2015, contaminating drinking water there.

They are mostly farmers and ranchers, making a last stand against the pipeline - the fate of which now rests with an obscure state regulatory board, the Nebraska Public Service Commission. The group is fine-tuning an economic argument it hopes will resonate better in this politically conservative state than the environmental concerns that dominated the successful push to block Keystone under former President Barack Obama. They contend the pipeline will provide mainly temporary jobs that will vanish once construction ends, and limited tax revenues that will decline over time. They face a considerable challenge. Now Tanderup and others are gearing up for another round of battle - on a decidedly more local stage, but with potentially international impact on energy firms and consumers. The latest Keystone XL showdown underscores the increasingly well-organized and diverse resistance to pipelines nationwide, which now stretches well beyond the environmental movement. Another ETP pipeline in Louisiana has drawn protests from flood protection advocates and commercial fishermen. Faded signs around the farm still advertise the concert Willie Nelson and Neil Young played here in 2014 to raise money for the protests. Keystone offers a path to get heavy crude from the Canada oil sands to refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast equipped to handle it. TransCanada has route approval in all of the U.S. states the line will cross except Nebraska, where the company says it has been unable to negotiate easements with landowners on about 9 percent of the 300-mile crossing. The commission has scheduled a public hearing in May, along with a week of testimony by pipeline supporters and opponents in August. Members face a deadline set by state law to take a vote by November. TransCanada declined to comment in response to Reuters inquiries seeking a more precise number and description of the jobs, including the proportion of them that are temporary - for construction - versus permanent. Trump has been more specific, saying the project would create 28,000 U.S. jobs. The study indicates those jobs would be temporary, including some 16,100 at firms with contracts for goods and services during construction, and another 26,000, depending on how workers from the original jobs spend their wages. The firm will pay property taxes on the pumping stations along the route, but not the land. Art and Helen Tanderup talk about where the Keystone XL Pipeline will cut through the farm that has been in his wife, Helen's family for more than 100 years near Neligh, Nebraska, U.S. April 12, 2017. The alliance plans to target the commissioners and their electoral districts with town halls, letter-writing campaigns, and billboards. During the televised ceremony where Trump awarded the federal permit for the pipeline, he promised to weigh in on the Nebraska debate. Love, the White House spokeswoman, said she did not know if Trump had called Nebraska officials. The commission members - one Democrat and four Republicans - have ties to a wide range of conflicting interests in the debate, making it difficult to predict their decision. According to state filings, one of the commissioners, Democrat Crystal Rhoades, is a member of the Sierra Club - an environmental group opposing the pipeline. Another, Republican Rod Johnson, has a long history of campaign donations from oil and gas firms. The others are Republicans with ties to the farming and ranching sectors - including one member that raises cattle in an area near where the pipeline would cross. All five members declined requests for comment. PREPPING THE WITNESSES TransCanada has been trying since 2008 to build the 1,100-mile line - from Hardisty, Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect to a network feeding the Midwest and Gulf Coast refining regions. The firm had its federal permit application rejected in 2015 by the Obama administration. The Ogallala aquifer supplies large-scale crop irrigation and cattle-watering operations. Steskal dug his boot into the ground on his property, kicking up sand to demonstrate his biggest concern about the pipeline. TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said the company has a good environmental record with its existing Keystone pipeline network in Nebraska, which runs east of the proposed Keystone XL. The company, however, has reported at least two big pipeline spills in other states since 2011, including some 400 barrels of oil spilled in South Dakota last year. The Domina Law Group is helping the opposition by preparing the landowners, including the Tanderups and Steskals, for the August hearings, much as they would prepare witnesses for trial. Eminent domain allows for the government to expropriate private land in the public interest. But Jorde said he thinks TransCanada would struggle to meet that threshold in Nebraska.

Out-of-state law enforcement from the Wisconsin State Patrol (WSP) was also deployed under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC). Just after 11 am, the combined eviction forces began their approach into the camp. Between a few dozen to a hundred water protectors were estimated remaining in camp at that time, with most having left the previous day but some having returned that morning by walking across the frozen Cannonball River. Bypassing the main entrance, two Bobcat-type skid steer loaders were used to clear a path down the snowy hill into the north end of Oceti Oyate. Different teams of law enforcement roamed throughout the north end of the Oceti camp, establishing perimeters and performing military-style sweeps of tipis and other structure, entering each structure with guns drawn. Several water protectors who remained in the camp were arrested. Some of the water protectors had been engaged in prayer at the time of arrest. It was reported that other arrestees told the officers that they were violating treaties as they made arrests. A group of veterans was also arrested while passively resisting. A separate force with utility terrain vehicles entered from the east. As on the previous day, North Dakota authorities arrested several journalists who were reporting on the scene. One water protector held a position on top of large structure for some time: After the eviction force finished clearing the entire grounds of the camp, they formed a curved formation facing south, and began pushing the remaining crowd back, forcing people to retreat onto the iced-over Cannonball River. As this push advanced, law enforcement charged forward and several arrests were made, and at least six officers fell face down in the mud and snow as they attempted to run downhill towards targets who evaded them. Two water protectors were also tackled and arrested during the charge. As some water protectors remained on the frozen Cannonball River, others had gathered to observe the eviction from the Rosebud camp on the south side of the river on Standing Rock Indian Reservation land. A water protector explained to Unicorn Riot that the hasty destruction of the structures would cause more pollution needlessly. After 2:50 pm, after the North Dakota state eviction force had completed their takeover of Oceti Oyate, Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) federal police began to push people out of the Rosebud camp which had also reportedly been slated for eviction yesterday. Park Rangers from the United States National Parks Service (NPS) assisted BIA police in evicting the Rosebud camp on the reservation side of the Cannonball River.

All rights reserved. Add Dakota Access Pipeline as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Dakota Access Pipeline news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Dakota Access Pipeline Add Interest The clash yesterday, which resulted in more than 100 arrests, came after months of demonstrations and an ongoing legal battle waged by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and others over the proposed 1,172-mile crude oil pipeline being built by Dakota Access, a subsidiary of the Texas-based company Energy Transfer Partners. Over a thousand protesters are still camped out near the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation in North Dakota. The push to block this pipeline has become one of the biggest Native American demonstrations in decades. The tribe argues that the pipeline will threaten the reservation's water supply and traverse culturally sacred sites. Jan. 25, 2016 Dakota Access announced in a statement that it had received permit approval by the North Dakota Public Service Commission, bringing the four-state crude oil pipeline a step closer to construction. Dakota Access wrote on its website that it hopes to have the pipeline in operation by the end of 2016, transporting 470,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois. July 27, 2016 Attorneys for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe took their first legal action to block the pipeline to the courts on this day, officially filing a complaint against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers over its process for granting permits to Dakota Access for the pipeline. Lawyers for the tribe also pressed charges against Dakota Access, and months of litigation followed. Most of the organized demonstrations and protesting began shortly after the tribe filed the lawsuit, and as the summer waned on activists and native groups from across the country began flocking to a camp set up in North Dakota near the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's reservation. The environment is an important part of our lives and any threats to it impacts our families, ancestors and future generations. Sept. 3, 2016 Protesters and private security workers hired by Dakota Access clashed on this day. Witnesses say private security workers unleashed pepper spray and pit bulls on a crowd of men, women, and some children who were protesting the pipeline over the weekend. But local authorities say the protesters became aggressive, nearly overwhelming the workers and security at the construction site. Sept. 9, 2016 A federal judge denied the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's request for a temporary injunction but appeared sympathetic toward the tribe's plight in his ruling. The same day, however, three federal agencies intervened in an unprecedented manner, requesting that the pipeline company voluntarily halt construction of the pipeline near Lake Oahe. Therefore, construction of the pipeline on Army Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe will not go forward at this time. Sept. 26, 2016 President Obama weighed in on the growing movement to block the pipeline, and hosted more than 500 Native American leaders for his eighth and final White House Tribal Nations Conference as president. Oct. 9, 2016 In the evening hours the day before Columbus Day, a federal holiday many indigenous people find offensive, a federal appeals court denied the tribe's appeal of the Sept. 9 ruling. Oct. 10, 2016 Actress Shailene Woodley was arrested while protesting the pipeline in North Dakota. Woodley broadcast video of her entire arrest on Facebook Live. She later pleaded not guilty to criminal trespass and riot charges.

A spokesperson for the Justice Department told ABC News that department officials were taking the situation seriously and offering assistance to local law enforcement. Oct. 27, 2016 Authorities moved in to clear protesters from private land and dismantle a roadblock that closed down a state highway. Heavily armed law enforcement officials surrounded protesters and reportedly used pepper spray, tear gas and a sound cannon. The Morton County Sheriff's Department announced that 141 protesters were arrested, bringing the number of those arrested since the protests began to more than 400. 0 Shares Email Star Comments Add Interests Customize your news feed by choosing the topics that interest you.

Experts weigh in on possible outcomes of Dakota Access Pipeline protest By Archie Ingersoll on Dec 3, 2016 at 3:11 p.m. Equally hard to predict is what will happen now as both sides appear as entrenched as ever. Concerned the pipeline will encroach on sacred sites and taint drinking water on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, protesters are hunkering down for a North Dakota winter. Looking in from the outside are academics who study protest movements and have been following the conflict in Morton County enough to offer some informed speculation on how the drawn-out, deadlocked situation may play out. Many observers have compared the Dakota Access protest to the 1973 standoff at Wounded Knee on South Dakota's Pine Ridge Reservation. But Dana Fisher, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland, said the protest at Standing Rock reminds her of the Occupy Wall Street encampment of 2011 that spread from New York to other cities. Like Occupy, the Dakota Access protest isn't just a one-day event. Though unlike the Occupy movement, which did not achieve its lofty goal of eliminating social and financial inequality, the protest near Standing Rock has a specific aim: blocking the pipeline's proposed crossing under the Missouri River. With such a tangible, conceivable goal, Fisher said, the protest will likely keep growing as it resonates among indigenous people and environmentalists. President Barack Obama said last month the Corps was looking at ways to reroute the pipeline. But whether his administration will act on the issue before he leaves office in January remains to be seen. On Thursday, Dec. 1, President-elect Donald Trump said for the first time that he supports the completion of the pipeline. Still, the effect Trump could have on the project's future is unclear, said Gail Small, a Native American Studies professor at Montana State University. Small said transfers of presidential power take time, including the process of installing Trump's appointees to lead federal agencies like the Corps. And she noted that a president's power is constrained by such agencies, which have broad discretion in making decisions about easements and the like. Gov. Jack Dalrymple, a pipeline proponent, has urged the Corps to issue the easement. The governor's spokesman, Jeff Zent, said he does not think it's feasible to reroute the pipeline, which is finished in North Dakota except for the river crossing. Aside from rerouting the pipeline or building it as planned, some say a third possibility is abandoning the project altogether. Mark Trahant, a University of North Dakota professor who blogs about native issues at TrahantReports.com, said he thinks Obama could still sign an executive order that says proper consultation with the Sioux regarding the pipeline did not occur. Such a decision would create a delay of about six months, enough time for the price of oil to drop to a point where the project doesn't make economic sense, Trahant said. The report came from the Cleveland-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a group aimed at reducing dependence on nonrenewable energy. The report said Energy Transfer will miss its Jan. 1 deadline to complete the pipeline, which would allow oil producers and shippers to renegotiate their contracts with the company and seek concessions, weakening the project's financial footing. In rebuttal, Energy Transfer spokeswoman Vicki Granado said Jan. 1 is not a contractual date; rather it was the company's original date for the pipeline to be in service. Granado said the actual contractual date for finishing the pipeline is confidential. 'Talk to people' The governor and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have made calls for protesters to vacate Corps-managed land where camping is not permitted. The governor issued his order Monday, Nov. 28, due to the dangers of harsh winter weather. Fisher said the smartest thing officials can do at this point is just leave the camp alone. North Dakota and Corps officials have said they don't plan to forcibly remove campers from the site. But the Corps has said people who stay may be prosecuted for trespassing. Trahant said he believes the potential for violence continues to be an issue, and he fears the situation could spiral out of control. Burgum declined to comment for this story, and Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault did not respond to interview requests. Granado said Energy Transfer expects ultimately to receive the easement and after that it would take 90 to 120 days to install the pipeline 95 to 115 feet beneath the riverbed. She added that construction is nearly complete in the other three states. Just as confident is Braun, a community organizer for the Indigenous Environmental Network and a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. On Thursday, as people were sledding, building snowmen and having snowball fights in the protest camp, Braun spoke of the unprecedented nature of the protest that's brought so many tribes together for a common purpose."}, {"URL": "https://www.change.org/p/remove-sheriff-kyle-kirchmeier-from-the-morton-county-sheriff-s-office", "Timestamp": "20180918222652", "Sentences": "Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

Winter is descending upon thousands of Native Americans camped out in North Dakota. For months, they have been protesting against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The early snowstorms of the season are rolling across the prairie. Temperatures frequently drop below freezing at night. Since April 2016, when the campaign to stop the pipeline began, the indigenous protest camps have transformed into an organised community. The Sacred Stone Camp is dense, close to the Cannonball River, sheltered from the wind by a steep bank and clusters of trees. Oceti Sakowin Camp is sprawling, home to an estimated 4,000 people, huddled around sacred fires, chatting with friends, sheltering from the cold in trucks, tepees, tents and yurts.

Doctors, traditional healers and psychologists provide care free of charge in the Oceti Sakowin camp, out of a series of shelters close to the central fire pit. Storage tents, pinned down against the wind with tarpaulins, are piled high with donated gloves, hats and sleeping bags. Many of these developments have been funded by social media campaigns. Although the vast majority of Dakota Access oil pipeline has been built, the section closest to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation - which will pass beneath the Missouri River - is still awaiting federal permits and approval.

A permit was initially granted by the Army Corps of Engineers, but the Department of Justice and other agencies intervened to override the decision on 9 September. But the struggle between the coalition of over 200 indigenous tribes and the oil company Dakota Access LLC has intensified in recent weeks. On 25 November the US Army Corps of Engineers issued a letter calling for the Oceti Sakowin camp, which sits on federally owned land, be evacuated by 5 December. This was followed by a similar evacuation order from the governor of North Dakota.

The local Morten County police are being sued for excess force by a number of camp residents.

Standing Rock Sioux tribe chairman Dave Archambault II said the spill is another sign that the courts should intervene. The company and the state made no announcements about the spill after it occurred. Walsh said the department only releases public notices of spills when there is an imminent threat to a waterway or public health. A spokeswoman told the Associated Press that the corporation maintains that the pipeline is safe and that the leak was contained in the proper manner. The Associated Press also reported that no other Dakota Access spills have been documented in any other states.

The leak was first reported to regulators on Dec. 5, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The incident may serve as something of a rallying cry for groups opposing the pipeline, which have said a spill could enter important watersheds and contaminate water. The point of release into the Ash Coulee Creek is about 18 miles from where it feeds into the Little Missouri River, which then feeds the Missouri, a major drinking water source, Seuss said. Frigid temperatures have made cleanup conditions difficult, but has also slowed the movement of oil down the creek because the water has frozen, he added. PHMSA on Tuesday said an investigation into the incident was ongoing. The 24,000 barrel per day, six-inch pipeline runs intermittently, and at maximum has capacity to flow at 1,000 barrels per hour, Owen said. Monitoring equipment on the line did not detect the leak, possibly because of intermittent flow, she added. Two cows were reported dead near the site of the spill, but whether the leak caused their death was unclear, Seuss noted. Belle Fourche Pipeline Company has reported 12 pipeline leaks since 2010. In 2011, the company reported two major leaks, one that spilled more than 1,900 barrels of refined products Campbell County, Wyoming, and another that leaked 1,000 barrels of crude in McKenzie County, North Dakota, according to PHMSA data.

President-elect Donald Trump has said he supports finishing the project. Trump owns stock in the company building the pipeline but has said his support has nothing to do with his investment. What started as a small but fierce protest in a remote spot along the Missouri River months ago has evolved into an epic standoff involving hundreds of tribes, various celebrities, and activists. About 250 military veterans joined the protest Sunday. Environmental groups that protested alongside the tribes also rejoiced at the decision. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its allies in the environmental and activist movements had said they were doing just that: using Lake Oahe in North Dakota as a place to take a stand by setting up camps and obstructing roads to block the Dakota Access Pipeline and its owner, Energy Transfer Partners. The pipeline, if completed, would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal in Illinois. At 30 inches in diameter, it could transport an estimated 470,000 barrels of oil per day. Army officials said the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an environmental-impact statement with full public input and analysis, a process likely to take many months. Energy Transfer Partners had said it was unwilling to reroute the project. The federal government had ordered people to leave the main encampment, which is on Army Corps of Engineers land, by Monday. But demonstrators said they were prepared to stay, and authorities said they would not forcibly remove them. About 250 members of the group Veterans Stand for Standing Rock gathered earlier Sunday about a mile from the Oceti Sakowin, or Seven Council Fires, camp. Art Grayson, 29, of Cambridge, Mass., a Navy veteran and Harvard graduate student, told the Associated Press that he came to the camp as part of the veterans group because he thought the demonstrators could use his help. Grayson said he flew to the state, then met with other veterans and rode the final leg of the trip from Bismarck in a pickup truck. Jo-Ellen Darcy said she based her decision on a need to explore alternate routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing. Her office had announced on November 14, 2016 that it was delaying the decision on the easement to allow for discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation lies 0.5 miles south of the proposed crossing. Tribal officials have expressed repeated concerns over the risk that a pipeline rupture or spill could pose to its water supply and treaty rights. Darcy said that the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an Environmental Impact Statement with full public input and analysis. The Dakota Access Pipeline is an approximately 1,172 mile pipeline that would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Pakota, Illinois.

Visit Website Arrayed against the protectors on this day is a vast phalanx of police from multiple states and agencies, National Guardsmen, and armed private security forces working for Energy Transfer Partners. The equipment, weapons, uniforms, and tactics they deploy immediately bring me back to my 2011 and 2012 reporting trips to Afghanistan. And while it may seem unlikely for such events to unfold in rural North Dakota; the objective is all too familiar: oil. Over the last seven months, thousands of people, including members of over 280 tribes and First Nations, have joined the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline, which passes half a mile from its reservation. A victory for the Tribes came on September 9th, when the Army Corps of Engineers denied permission for the pipeline to pass under the Missouri River while it conducted a more thorough review. Energy Transfer Partners flatly refused. Just four small areas remain for the laying of the pipe: the land immediately to the west of Highway 1806; Highway 1806 itself; under Front Line Camp on the east, which will also serve as a staging ground for the final step; and passage below the Missouri River, a little over a mile away. On October 23rd, a group of hundreds of protectors claiming eminent domain over the land as its rightful owners under the 1851 Laramie Treaty, decided that their bodies would have to act as the final buffer between the pipeline and the water. They established the Front Line Camp directly in its path, blocking Highway 1806 in several locations as well. On almost any other day, in any other year, the site of the protest would simply be a lonely stretch of two-lane highway reaching out across prairie fields barren but for waving yellow strands of grass, some corn, and the occasional bale of hay. Keep going north 50 miles to reach Bismarck; half a mile south to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Reservation. This beauty is under attack. As I detailed in November in an article from North Dakota, in 2006, the onset of a highly unexpected and equally unregulated oil fracking boom from an underground deposit known as the Bakken Formation introduced an economic bounty for some, but also toxic flares, fracking fluid spills, pipeline ruptures, and an economic roller coaster for many more. Nearly 1,800 oil- and gas-related accidents, fires, blowouts, leaks, spills, ruptures, and other problems were reported here in just the 12 months from November 2014 to November 2015. The massive increase in oil production could not stay put for long, and trains and pipelines were increasingly employed to carry the bounty outward to faraway refineries and terminals for overseas export. As with so many locations where oil is produced, few are more harmed here than the Native population. The heart of the Bakken boom lies beneath Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, which is also the site of the majority of its associated harms described above, while its pipelines pass near and through ever more Native land. All of which helped lay the groundwork for a historic moment of resistance. October 27th, 12:40 p.m. Acrid black smoke billows skyward from tires set ablaze, part of a blockade across Highway 1806 devised by the protectors, aimed at keeping the police forces from advancing and taking Front Line Camp. As the day progresses, the constant buzz of a helicopter circling low overhead, combined with the rumbling of a small plane occupying the air above it, is abruptly overtaken by the crushing boom of an exploding concussion grenade, forcing hundreds of bodies to instinctively contract inward as one. With a quiet swoosh, a Taser releases its electrified metal barb into the cheek and hip of a young man; inches away, the liquid flush of pepper spray is felt long before it is seen; a searing and biting sting that forces eyes and throats to immediately lock shut. Rubber bullets smack into flesh; and a burst of police tackle a youth causing skin and bone to whack and tear against pavement. Shouts of fear, pain, anger, and resistance follow, interspaced with periods and areas of a relative calm that is balanced on a pin waiting for the next prick. Clockwise, from top left: Police from multiple states and agencies, National Guardsmen, and armed private security forces working for Energy Transfer Partners gather on Highway 1806 to remove Native American water protectors and their allies from the Front Land Camp and barricades on Highway 1806, on October 27th, 2016. She then points to the west, to a field on the other side of the highway, where construction of the pipeline is actively underway. As we watch, a group of protectors takes to this field. Just as quickly, an armored Humvee and line of police fill the area, pepper spray canisters as large as fire extinguishers and batons at the ready, repelling the protectors with intimidation and arrests. Medics pass out bright orange ear plugs. I later learn from Lyle Jeremy Rubin, a Marine Corps veteran who served in Afghanistan, that the source of the high pitched screeching siren occasionally blasted at us is a Long Range Acoustic Device. The shrill sound, also used to keep pirates at bay and regulate the movements of wildlife, can over-stimulate the heart, resulting in agitation among those targeted. Today, the LRAD is fitted to a massive tan armor-plated International MaxxPro Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle (MRAP) designed to withstand Improvised Explosive Devices in war zones holding court front and center on the highway. A black counter-terrorism vehicle, the Ballistic Engineered Armored Response Counter Attack Truck sits closely at its side. Numerous tan armored High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (a.k.a. Humvee) are arrayed here, throughout the fields, and on surrounding hill tops, where many remain to this day. Photographs later confirm that the snipers are perched within Humvees, their heads poking out of turrets at the top, rifles pointed and ready. A force flanks to the right, moving into Front Line Camp. They are slow, methodical, and practiced. With tears streaming down her face, she describes the hurt and shame she felt at seeing the exact same equipment used in Iraq deployed on her homeland. The Oklahoma Ponca elder and Tribal Council Member is a figure of calm surrounded by a swirl of chaos. Several people huddle protectively around her, placing their hands on her back and head, using their bodies as shields. Camp-Horinek and the others stand impenetrable as the stream of police engulfs and then passes by them. They are arrested and jailed. A larger prayer circle led by male tribal elders has gathered further south on the highway. When the police line reaches it; they too are arrested. Approximately 4 p.m. A group of about 50 protectors in a large circle on the ground in Front Line Camp, arms intertwined, praying, singing, and holding ground. He is pulled out of the circle, tackled, and arrested. The police then slowly encircle and arrest the remaining group, before continuing their steady forward crawl. Approximately 4:30 p.m. As if out of a mirage, a herd of buffalo appear to the east of the melee, streaming majestic across the hills. The nearby action freezes as one person follows the gaze of another. Shock turns to momentary joy. Whoops, cheers, and ululations fill the air. Two Native horse riders follow the herd, fists raised, only to be chased down by SWAT in ATVs. One horse is so badly injured by police that it is later put down. As they are pushed back along the highway, groups of protectors stop and try to erect further barricades, using hay, logs, and even dismantling and locking themselves under a truck. Over the course of the day, perhaps five to 10 people throw water bottles, some rocks, and even an occasional log at police. Some even fight back. It is a common sentiment. But for most of those with whom I spoke, the worst violence committed on this day was not done by the protectors, nor the police; it took place to the west of the line where the construction equipment dug into the sacred burial ground, moving the pipeline ever forward, with an invading military force to protect it. Approximately 6 p.m. Front Line Camp is gone, and with it the barriers on Highway 1806. One-hundred-and-forty-one people were arrested, the others returning to the two main camps. During the night, three cars are set ablaze further down Highway 1806 in between the camps to the south, and the pipeline construction to the north; a barricade none admit to erecting behind which the Humvees, snipers, and police remain affixed on roadways and hills to this day. Cars sat ablaze the night of October 27th, 2016, on Highway 1806. Humvees, snipers, and police to the north, the Dakota Access Pipeline under construction beyond.

The fight against DAPL has rallied Native rights activists, environmentalists and more, but it appears that this specific battle is on its last legs. Federal court filings obtained by reporters revealed that Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the controversial pipeline, is preparing for full operation of the pipeline. In the filing, Energy Transfer Partners revealed the status of the pipeline: Oil has been placed in the Dakota Access Pipeline underneath Lake Oahe. Dakota Access is currently commissioning the full pipeline and is preparing to place the pipeline into service. Although the filing states that ETP is preparing the pipeline for operation, it doesn't specify when exactly it will be fully operational. Many were joyous in Dec. 2016 when the Army Corps of Engineers blocked the pipeline, but shortly after his inauguration, President Donald Trump signed an order in favor of approving the final permits for the pipeline. A few weeks after Trump's DAPL order, the water protectors were evicted from the Oceti Sakowin camp on the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, and they ceremonially burned their camp in protest. Despite the executive back-and-forth about the pipeline and their many setbacks, Native activists are keeping the fight alive. Despite being denied an injunction to halt the pipeline on religious grounds in early March, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe are continuing to raise money for their legal challenge to the pipeline. On their crowdfunding page, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe denoted two distinct legal strategies they're deploying to fight the pipeline: one based on religious freedom laws (which were denied in their most recent request) and one based on treaty and environmental challenges.

In its consultations with the Standing Rock Sioux about the pipeline crossing underneath Lake Oahe within a half mile of the reservation, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers purposefully withheld key studies that could have helped the tribe evaluate the risks. One report modeled damage from potential spills; another weighed the likelihood of spills; a third compared alternative routes and discussed the environmental justice concerns raised by the project. The contents of these documents, which have still not been released to the public, are unknown. Kristen Carpenter, Oneida Indian Nation visiting professor of law at Harvard Law School, was amazed to learn that the government had denied these documents to the tribe. Carpenter believes the Corps should have done a more thorough analysis and consulted more fully with the tribe from the beginning. But the Army maintains it both was and is on firm legal footing. Her memo directs the Corps to release those documents that it had withheld from the tribe. In early December, the thousands of protesters camped at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation celebrated what appeared to be a massive victory. But the fight is far from over. The 1,172-mile pipeline, designed to carry Bakken crude oil to refineries in Illinois and beyond, would pass within half a mile of the reservation and underneath Lake Oahe, which the tribe relies on for drinking water and treaty fishing and hunting rights. An earlier pipeline route that would have crossed the Missouri River 10 miles north of Bismarck was rejected for a variety of reasons, including potential risk to the water supply for that larger, whiter, more affluent community. But later that day, a fierce winter storm hit, and Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II urged protesters to leave. Thousands did. But President-elect Donald Trump supports the pipeline, in which he held a financial interest until recently. After the tribe asked for a preliminary injunction to stall construction, a federal judge in September ruled that the Corps had met its obligation to consult with it, saying that tribal representatives repeatedly failed to attend meetings. In response to protests and political pressure, however, the Department of the Army, the Justice Department and the Department of the Interior stepped in to block the project while the Corps reconsidered. That led up to the Corps deciding that a full environmental impact statement is necessary. Experts say it will be difficult for the Trump administration to evade this time-consuming requirement, which entails extensive study and significant input from the tribe and the public. Dakota Access LLC, the pipeline company, asked a judge to intervene, claiming that an easement is unnecessary because the government already gave permission for the pipeline to cross the lake. Grijalva visited Standing Rock in September and says he was impressed: The protesters include representatives of many tribes and environmental and civil rights activists from around the country and abroad, strongly united and prepared for the attacks on the environment, poor communities and tribes that they expect to see once Trump takes office. Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome. The incoming administration has not thought through the consequences of their ridiculous intended policies. One will be further loss of our drinkable water which will hang around their necks for whatever time is left to the planet. And remember that the Podesta emails showed us that Citigroup picked the Obama Administration. To these psychopaths, clean fresh water openly available to the public is unwanted competition. If the price of oil goes up, that's a bummer. If the price of water goes too high, we die. The pipeline would stop right there; the company would never sign. Hell, if we charged the oil industry for all the money they cost us, all pipelines would go dry. The next chapter in the fight for indigenous rights will take place in the spring. Trump, the oil man, will no doubt come down on the side of petroleum and those who profit from it. Yes, I get that it's dangerous, but his insistence that the temporary halt was a victory and everyone should leave didn't ring well. The Dixie-crats of the day portrayed Lincoln as an Ape with glee and lived to regret their Treasonous Folly. Nor would a President Clinton the Second say that the Water Protectors needed to stop being so violent, and honor the pipeline layers who just wanted to get back to work. Oh wait. Both of those things happened. We have common enemies here. And those enemies are not named Obama, Clinton OR Trump. Those enemies put people like Obama, Clinton and Trump into office to carry out their will. However, it is incumbent upon us to see the distinctions between Obama (and Clinton), under whom the Army Corps of Engineers have ACTUALLY STOPPED the construction of the pipeline, albeit temporarily (and giving us more time to organize the fight, as Grijalva says), and the Trump contingent of the oligarchy who will have no consideration for tribal or environmental rights WHATSOEVER and will be foaming at the mouth to crush the resistence and renew pipeline construction ASAP. Every successful revolution occurred when significant numbers of the enforcers refused to follow orders to crush dissenters. The veterans could have forced the enforcers to make that decision. When Obama halted the project temporarily, he prevented that confrontation. It long has been, but is now such as never before. They are all about deception. It's a deflection, and nothing but a transparent ploy, part of the lying, manipulative, inflexible corporate-fasci st agenda putting on a show of being the opposite. Don't be fooled (anymore). Everything is a tightly-choreog raphed show to the corporate-fasci sts working to enslave us increasingly. The elitists couldn't care less about us, The People. We are all expendable to them. They just want to make as much profit off us in the process, from cradle to grave. You're dealing with psychotics, sociopaths and psychopaths who run the globalist corporate-fasci st show, so you can't in reality expect any true or real justice from them. It's not in their DNA. As the government's treatment of the water-protector s doing nothing but non-violently exercising their rights and duties shows, the authoritarian, more and more totalitarian, powers-that-be don't care how many people they harm along the way. And while everyone's watching the show, Saudi Arabia announced they were going to stop over-producing oil and OPEC has agreed to cut supplies, ensuring that prices will rise. And the Federal Reserve just raised interest rates for the first time in years, and say they plan to hike the rates 3 more times in 2017. Inflation to go along with the cuts in social services.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and protesters say the oil pipeline, which crosses the Missouri River nearby, will pose a grave threat to drinking water on the reservation and farther downstream if it ever leaks. Construction on the pipeline, which will carry oil from the Bakken fields in western North Dakota, resumed this month with support from President Trump, and the project could be finished this spring. The North Dakota authorities said the closing of the main protest camp, which sits on Army Corps of Engineers land, was necessary to prevent pollution during imminent spring floods. The protest site had developed into a make-do city, with semipermanent buildings, medical tents and abandoned cars. If that washed into the Missouri River, the authorities said, the results could be damaging to the environment. It is a new beginning. About an hour after the protest camp was cleared, Mr. Burgum signed into law four bills that had been passed largely as a result of the protests. They expand the scope of criminal trespassing laws, make it illegal to cover your face with a mask or hood while committing a crime, and increase the penalties for riot offenses. The protests, which have included clashes with law enforcement and an influx of outsiders to a sparsely populated state, have tested the patience of some in North Dakota.

Graeber (0) President-elect Donald Trump speaks to reporters Tuesday in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City. On Sunday, Trump said he'll resolve the issue for the Dakota Access oil pipeline when he takes office in January. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in early December said it would not approve an easement for further construction on the pipeline to bridge Lake Oahe in North Dakota. Jo-Ellen Darcy, an Army assistant secretary for civil works, said the decision stemmed in part from water-quality concerns expressed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota. Several derailments of trains carrying oil from North Dakota proved deadly over the past few years. Donald Trump, who is slated to assume the U.S. presidency in mid-January, told Fox News during the weekend he'd step into the process if it's required. Energy Transfer Partners, a company in which Trump once invested, and Sunoco Logistics Partners, the two companies behind the pipeline's construction, said the decision from the Army Corps of Engineers was a delay tactic from President Barack Obama, whose administration ruled against the Keystone XL oil pipeline on environmental grounds. RELATED Amnesty International steps into Dakota Access pipeline row Pipeline developers are pressing their case in court, pointing to July permits from the Army Corps for construction in the area of concern.

Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger This summer, Tim Mentz Sr. took to YouTube to tell the world about the destruction of his cultural heritage. A former tribal historic preservation officer of the Standing Rock Sioux, Mentz wore a baseball cap, rimless glasses and two thin braids of graying hair. He was upset and spoke rapidly about the area behind him, an expanse of the Great Plains cut by a new 150-foot-wide road. Two days before, Mentz had testified to the D.C. District Court to report the area that lay in the path of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) corridor holds 82 cultural features and 27 graves. By the next day, DAPL construction workers graded the area. Behind where Mentz stood in the video was a place known as the Strong Heart Society Staff, where a sacred rattle or staff was placed within stone rings. Here members of the elite warrior society would come to make pledges. As an anthropologist who has worked with Native Americans for more than a decade to document their sacred places in the paths of new power plants, power lines, water pipelines and more, the battle in North Dakota is all too familiar. Consultation with tribes too often breaks down because federal agencies are unwilling to consider how Native Americans view their own heritage. Irreplaceable heritage If completed, the Dakota Access Pipeline would run from North Dakota to Illinois for nearly 1,200 miles, carrying up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day. DAPL would meander across the landscape, through farms, around cities, buried underground and across more than 200 waterways. The passage of the pipeline over and under waterways requires permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This federal authorization in turns requires compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The stand-off between Native Americans in North Dakota and an oil pipeline project developer and police forces has inspired protests across the country. The NHPA does not guarantee preservation. For many years, Native Americans would have had little input on a project such as DAPL. But in 1992, Congress amended the NHPA to formally include traditional cultural properties. The amendments directed federal agencies, in carrying out their responsibilities under the NHPA, to consult with Indian tribes that attach religious and cultural significance to these sacred places. Beyond consultation In North Dakota, federal and state review and compliance measures for DAPL were combined. Engineers rerouted DAPL to avoid all but nine sites. Archaeologists serve an important role in documenting historic properties. But they tend to view the world through the lens of science and history. They search out buried villages, pottery shards, bones, broken stone tools. Traditional cultural properties in the U.S. can often be archaeological sites, artifacts that ancestors once touched and places that mark ancestral homes. But just as often they can be a mountain where spirits dwell or a spring where water is gathered for ceremonies. They can be a traditional area for collecting plants or animals that sustain and heal communities. They can be origin places where ancestors emerged onto the earth or named places recalled in ancient tongues. Zuni elders Octavius Seowtewa and John Bowannie, and archaeologist Sarah Herr, look at a shrine archaeologists misidentified. Chip Colwell, Author provided This is why documenting traditional cultural properties requires not the work of archaeologists but Native Americans as well. On one project I conducted with the Hopi tribe to detail cultural resources along a 470-mile power line, we needed weeks of research to identify more than 200 plant species that the tribe uses in its traditional religious and healing practices. When it comes to traditional practices, Native Americans see what archaeologists overlook. Tribal surveys For DAPL, a tribal survey was not undertaken. In North Dakota the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers tried to engage in consultation dozens of times, but the Standing Rock Sioux largely refused because the federal agency only wanted to consult on a narrow corridor at water crossings instead of the entire pipeline. Once, though, consultation did occur at Lake Oahe on March 8, 2016. Current designs call for the pipeline to go under this now controversial waterway, which the Sioux want protected. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials admitted they were unaware of some of these sites. Chip Colwell, Author provided On Sept. 21 and then again on Oct. 20, according to an email I received from the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Office, delegations that included law enforcement, Standing Rock Sioux officials and tribal and state archaeologists went to the areas that Mentz suggested contained 82 sites and 27 burials. Two bones were recovered, but analysis showed them to be from a horse, cow, or bison. It would seem that the main sites Mentz agonized over had escaped physical destruction. However, tribal input would be needed to determine if the sites, so close to the corridor, could still suffer from indirect and cumulative impacts. Not too late Because consultation broke down and so little of the pipeline has received tribal survey, we must wonder how much has been missed. Nearly 90 percent of the pipeline has already been completed. This is an unfortunate but common occurrence. Last month I went out with traditional leaders of the Zuni tribe in New Mexico to identify traditional cultural properties under the NHPA in the path of a massive network of water pipelines. When we arrived, we found dozens of construction workers busily laying the new pipe. An archaeological survey was already completed; the construction had begun with the consent of the federal agency. We were too late.

TransCanada has also reported several smaller spills. Details were still emerging on Friday about the latest spill, which blackened a roughly 100-yard radius in a grassy field outside Amherst, S.D., and caused the pipeline to be shut down. About 75 TransCanada workers and contractors were at the site on Friday, along with federal and state regulators, to begin a lengthy cleanup that will include the excavation of part of the pipeline. Mr. Walsh said that the spill had been contained and that there was no immediate risk to drinking water or residents. Ed Hirs, a finance lecturer at the University of Houston and a partner in a small oil company, said it appeared TransCanada was responding appropriately by releasing information and sending workers to clean up.

The Keystone XL pipeline would be a roughly 1,100-mile addition to that network, but it still needs approval from the Nebraska Public Service Commission, which has scheduled a vote for Monday. Defenders of Keystone XL, among them President Trump and many labor unions and business groups, have called the pipeline an economic necessity that would create jobs and transport oil more safely than a train or a truck.

But layers of federal regulation - applying only to tribal lands - slowed them down for years, frightened away investors and cost them millions of dollars. Fort Berthold has since caught up to become one of the state's most productive regions. But the initial delays undermined the MHA Nation's sense of sovereignty and cost it badly needed revenue - an experience echoed in widespread complaints from other tribes and from energy firms, including some owned by Native Americans. Now, with U.S. President Donald Trump in office and oil prices rising, their frustration is fueling a renewed push to streamline approvals for drilling and mining on Indian reservations. Clearing regulatory hurdles for a single project on tribal lands can take as many as 50 steps, compared to a half dozen for oil wells on private property. The process can take three times as long to complete, according to tribal leaders, lawyers specializing in Native American issues, oil company executives and federal regulators. Officials at the agency overseeing that process - the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), a division of the Department of Interior - did not respond to repeated requests for comment. A spokesperson for Trump, who campaigned on a promise to slash energy regulation, declined a request for comment. The stakes are high. Native American reservations cover just 2 percent of the nation's surface, but by some estimates contain as much as a fifth of all U.S. oil and gas reserves, along with vast coal stockpiles. Some tribes, for environmental or cultural reasons, have shunned the idea of developing these reserves, but many others want to tap the vast wealth beneath their homelands. A coalition of Native Americans appointed by Trump's team to guide his Indian policy is researching proposals to make energy development easier on tribal lands - including the controversial idea of transferring them to private ownership. Representatives of the coalition did not respond to requests for comment. Congress, now firmly in Republican control after November's election, also appears poised to act. The Indian affairs committees in the House and Senate are planning to re-introduce legislation this year that would streamline Bureau of Indian Affairs approval processes for tribal energy resource agreements, said Senator John Hoeven, a Republican from North Dakota and the new chair of the Senate Indian affairs committee. As Trump takes office, Wells Fargo website to aid employees vanishes U.S. Representative Raul Grijalva, a Democrat from Arizona, has opposed previous efforts to relax energy regulations on tribal lands, including a 2015 proposal he argues would have undermined public input before project approvals. That could weaken the legal arguments of residents impacted by environmental damage, he said in an interview. Wait, wait, wait The United States holds title to about 56 million acres of tribal lands, a vestige of the treaties made between 1778 and 1871 to end wars between indigenous Indians and European settlers. On Fort Berthold and other reservations, energy development requires a uniquely large number of easements and environmental permits, all of which must be approved by multiple federal agencies in a process overseen by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Former North Dakota Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan - who was in office when the shale boom hit his state - said he understood that regulations can preserve Native American culture by keeping tribal lands environmentally sound and off the real estate market. But he also said he recognized them as a bottleneck. A 2015 report by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office found that the problems went beyond the processes in law and regulations. Poor management by the Bureau of Indians Affairs has hindered energy development and resulted in lost revenue for tribes, the office concluded. The report also found that BIA offices were understaffed and had failed to keep adequate records. Dave Williams, CEO of MHA Nation-chartered energy company Missouri River Resources, said his firm has learned how to work around the regulatory process, but called it frustrating. Deregulation could also benefit private oil drillers including Devon Energy Corp, Occidental Petroleum, BP and others that have sought to develop leases on reservations through deals with tribal governments. Those companies did not respond to requests for comment. Burgum, tribe hold five-hour meeting at Standing Rock Tribal opposition, solidarity A substantial segment of the Native American community continues to oppose energy development on tribal land or would like to see it limited. The Northern Cheyenne in Montana, for example, live atop rich coal reserves but have shunned mining it because they fear it will bring pollution and undermine their way of life. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota has galvanized the U.S. environmental movement with its ongoing protests against a pipeline constructed near its reservation. But many tribes that supported the Standing Rock protests were motivated by protecting a tribe's right to govern itself rather than by opposition to fossil fuel development. Among the tribes backing the protests were the Southern Ute Tribe in Colorado, the Ute Tribe of Utah, the Montana Crow and the Navajo Nation across the Southwest, all of which are pursuing energy development on their own lands. Tribes are also seeking to curtail what they call unjust taxation of energy projects on tribal lands by states in which their reservations are located. For many tribal leaders, the desire for more control over drilling projects is as much about self-determination as money. Back in Fort Berthold, MHA Nation Councilman Fred Fox said he felt it was time for Washington to hand more responsibility for tribal lands back to the tribes.

They've come from Japan, Russia and Germany. Australia, Israel and Serbia. And, of course, there are the allies, not exclusively Native American or indigenous, who've flocked here from all corners of the US. They're fighting against what they see as corporate greed, an environmental threat and an assault on sacred land. Demonstrating is their proud daily work. The Standing Rock Sioux call this reservation home, and many are not on the frontlines of this months-long, and at times violent, protest. Read More The answer to that last question: Not even close. Wishing they'd go home No one makes this clearer than Robert Fool Bear Sr., 54, district chairman of Cannon Ball. The town he runs, estimated population of 840, is just a few miles from the action. It's so close that, given the faceoffs with law enforcement, you have to pass through a police checkpoint to reach it. It's about time people heard from folks like him, he says. Fool Bear has had it with the protesters. He says that more than two years ago, when members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe could have attended hearings to make their concerns known, they didn't care. Now, suddenly, the crowds are out of control, and he fears it's just a matter of time before someone gets seriously hurt. Go down to the camps, he says, and you won't see many Standing Rock Sioux. The presence of all these people has become a downright nuisance to his community, he says. Given the roadblocks, residents of Cannon Ball are often forced to go more than 40 miles out of their way. Native Americans march to the site of a sacred burial ground that was disturbed by bulldozers building the Dakota Access Pipeline on September 4, 2016 near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Not long ago, he found three teenage girls from Ontario, Canada, camped out inside his storage shed. A white woman from Spokane, Washington, came to see him for help, saying she'd come here with nothing and her car had broken down. When he was at the casino recently, someone approached him about two young kids who were on their own because their parents had been arrested. The situation has dissolved to madness, he says, and he wishes Dave Archambault II, the Standing Rock Sioux chairman, would speak up. And he's not alone in feeling this way. Two women who listen in as he talks keep nodding in agreement, but they don't want to speak. Just look at a recent vote in the community for further proof that Fool Bear's not the only naysayer. When protest organizers presented a request to build a new winter camp in Cannon Ball earlier this month, his community shot it down. Of the 88 people who voted, he says 66 were against the camp, less than 10 were for it and the rest remained undecided. A Standing Rock Sioux flag flies over a protest encampment near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Even though Fool Bear is against the protests, that doesn't mean he's not preparing to help people out, too. He anticipates opening the community gymnasium for people without beds come winter, and a growing pile of sleeping bags and blankets sits in his office. Those protesters from Arizona, Georgia and California won't know what hit them when the cold rushes in, he says.

A fight worth having The tribal headquarters sits in the Sioux County seat of Fort Yates, nearly 30 miles south of the protests. To hear it from those hanging out in Club Diamond Z, a bar and deli, Standing Rock Sioux support of the protests is universal. They can't fathom how anyone would disagree. Artist Roger Valandra, 61, says he travels north to join the protests once a week. A proud Vietnam Vet, he says the freedom to peacefully demonstrate was something he fought for, just like his nieces and nephews who've served in Iraq. To feel suppressed by the nation he's served offends him. He's baffled by the flood of law enforcement from nearby states and North Dakota counties he's never even heard of. Any violence, he says, was provoked by them. Valandra and those around him at the bar begin to rattle off the offenses, many of which they heard about through social media. They talk about tear gas, rubber bullets, sound cannons and concussion grenades. They speak about the elder who was beaten with a club, the horse that had to be put down, the boy whose wrist was broken. She grew up believing racism didn't exist; not anymore. She brings up the recent acquittal of Ammon Bundy and six others, who occupied a federal wildlife refuge earlier this year. She pulls up a Facebook post, showing a photo of a number scrawled on a man's arm after he was arrested Thursday and words likening the treatment to what Nazis once did. Online comments and the stereotyping of her people leave her stunned. She wants people to know this battle isn't about race. Her father doesn't question what will happen to the reservation's water if the pipeline goes in. Just look at the track record of oil companies, he says, and understand that the problem will grow.

Police remove pipeline protesters 01:20 A shrug of indifference Ten miles west of the protests, a man who doesn't want to be named, for fear of retribution, admits he looks forward to the pipeline. It'll mean fewer trucks barreling down these rural highways and fewer trains flying down the tracks. Back at Cannon Ball, however, Carl Bruce, 52, isn't afraid to say his piece. For this Standing Rock Sioux who has lived his life here, the pipeline doesn't matter. If it breaks, he says he'd just work around it. The pipeline is coming, like it or not, he says. The world may watch this ongoing battle and believe it's a unifying force for his people, but Bruce just shrugs his shoulders and walks away. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.

Construction will be stopped and the pipeline will not go under the Missouri River. (Full statement can be read below). The corps had given permission to pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners, but in September it said more analysis was warranted in the wake of American Indian concerns. Jo-Ellen Darcy said she based her decision on a need to explore alternate routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing. Her office had announced on November 14, 2016 that it was delaying the decision on the easement to allow for discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation lies 0.5 miles south of the proposed crossing. Tribal officials have expressed repeated concerns over the risk that a pipeline rupture or spill could pose to its water supply and treaty rights. The Dakota Access Pipeline is an approximately 1,172 mile pipeline that would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Pakota, Illinois. The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter and is projected to transport approximately 470,000 barrels of oil per day, with a capacity as high as 570,000 barrels. However, it was becoming increasingly clear he was punting this issue down the road. Roads, bridges, transmission lines, pipelines, wind farms and water lines will be very difficult, if not impossible, to build when criminal behavior is rewarded this way. In my conversation with Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy today, she was unable to give any legal reasons for the decision and could not answer any questions about rerouting the pipeline. I feel badly for the Corps of Engineers because of the diligent work it did on this project, only to have their Commander-in-Chief throw them under the bus. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is praising the decision. Sanders says the country should not increase its fossil fuel dependence and accelerate the crisis of climate change. The pipeline still remains in limbo. The incoming administration already stated its support for the project and the courts have already stated twice that it appeared the Corps followed the required process in considering the permit. For the next month and a half, nothing about this project will change. For the immediate future, the safety of residents, protesters, law enforcement, and workers remains my top priority as it should for everyone involved.

To block the construction of an oil pipeline. On Thursday, the group was met by scores of police wearing riot gear and riding in military-style armored vehicles. By the end of the day, after firing tear gas, dismantling teepees and seeking to disperse the crowd, police said they had arrested 141 people, according to news reports. The pipeline would save money for oil producers in North Dakota, many of whom ship their crude oil in rail cars across Canada and the northern United States. The reduction in oil transported by rail would also bring down rates for transporting grain out of South Dakota. Railroads that, with little competition, have been charging hefty rates. The winners would also include the Dakota Access owners: a partnership called Energy Transfer, and its investors. They include: Donald Trump. Energy Transfer is a master limited partnership, a type of corporation that does not pay corporate taxes but which passes profits through to the partners, who pay income tax. Lots of reasons. Then there are the Native American Groups, nursing grievances dating back to the 19th century treaties in which tribes ceded much of the Dakotas to the U.S. government. The protestors say the 1851 and 1868 Fort Laramie treaties left areas west of the Missouri River to the Lakota or Sioux tribes. Energy Transfer says it obtained right of way from private landowners. And the Army Corps of Engineers, which approved the route, says the pipeline crosses half a mile north of the modern day Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Native American groups have also raised two other objections: danger to water supplies and sacred grounds including Lake Oahe. They also say that the pipeline would dig up sacred burial grounds and historic archaeological artifacts. The protestors also say that Energy Transfer moved the route of the pipeline, which originally passed through wealthier areas of the state close to Bismarck. Many people support the pipeline, even those who worry about climate change. One reason, they say, is that the pipeline would be safer than trains, which have derailed with oil cargos on several occasions. Another reason, they say, is that we still need the oil and producers will find ways of getting it to market. A lot depends on who becomes president. He said concerns about sacred grounds could be addressed through the use of tribal monitors or laying the pipeline well below areas with artifacts.

Protesters against the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline block a highway in near Cannon Ball, N.D., on Wednesday, Oct. 26, 2016. In 1877, the U.S. government initiated the still ongoing process of chipping away and dividing the land it had granted to the people of the Lakota and Dakota nations, with significant reductions taking place in 1889 and then again during the 1950s and 1960s, when the Army Corps of Engineers built five large dams along the Missouri River, uprooting villages and sinking 200,000 acres of land below water. Because the Corps neglected to consult the Standing Rock Sioux, as it was required to do under the National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106), the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Interior, and the American Council on Historic Preservation all criticized the assessment, but the project was eventually approved. For the Standing Rock Sioux, the Dakota Access project poses two immediate threats. First, the pipeline would run beneath Lake Oahe, the reservoir that provides drinking water to the people of Standing Rock.

On Sept. 11, 2001, he was living in New York City, and after seeing the towers fall, he decided to re-enlist. It was Clark Sr., the decorated war hero, who convinced him not to. As Clark Jr. recalls, his father foresaw U.S. military intervention in Iraq and warned that as a soldier he would be fighting a war that had nothing to do with defeating al Qaeda. Clark Jr. may never have served in combat, but when he talks about Standing Rock, he sounds like a battle-hardened general. A packing list virtually mirrors the ones issued to soldiers preparing to deploy to the field (minus the weapons). But there are also parts of the document that read like a revolutionary manifesto. A man from the Muskogee tribe looks at the Oceti Sakowin shrouded in mist during a protest against the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S. November 11, 2016. The money, Clark Jr. says, will only be used for helping volunteers with transportation costs and then bailing those who are arrested out of jail. The following morning they will join members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, including Young, for a traditional healing ceremony. With an eye toward the media, old military uniforms will be donned so that if the veterans are brutalized by the police, they are brutalized not as ordinary citizens, but as people who once served the government they are protesting against. Bagpipes will play, and traditional Sioux war songs will be sung. The music will continue as everyone marches together to the banks of the Missouri, on the other side of which a line of guards in riot gear will be standing ready with rifles, mace, batons, and dogs. Of course, as most veterans know full well, even the best plans go out the window the moment the shit hits the fan. It seems probable that the group will be met by fierce resistance from those charged with keeping people out of the construction site. Despite a recent decision by the Corps of Engineers to delay further work on the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners is still hoping to complete the project by January. The segment that will cross beneath the Missouri at Standing Rock is the last major piece of the puzzle. Nonetheless, Clark Jr. and Wood Jr. remain undeterred. If anything, the likelihood of approval only makes them more determined. After all, this is war. Read the original article on Task & Purpose. Copyright 2016. Follow Task & Purpose on Twitter.

(Reuters) - More than 2,000 U.S. military veterans plan to form a human shield to protect protesters of a pipeline project near a Native American reservation in North Dakota, organizers said, just ahead of a federal deadline for activists to leave the camp they have been occupying. Protesters include various Native American tribes as well as environmentalists and even actors including Shailene Woodley. State officials issued an order on Monday for activists to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, citing harsh weather conditions. The state's latest decision not to stop cars entering the protest site indicated local officials will not actively enforce Monday's emergency order to evacuate the camp issued by Governor Jack Dalrymple. The 1,172-mile (1,885 km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , is mostly complete, except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. Veterans Stand for Standing Rock, a contingent of more than 2,000 U.S. military veterans, intends to go to North Dakota by this weekend and form a human wall in front of police, protest organizers said on a Facebook page. Organizers could not immediately be reached for comment. Dull Knife, a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe from the Pine Ridge Reservation of South Dakota, said he has been camping at the protest site for months. Morton County Sheriff's Office spokesman Rob Keller said in an email his agency was aware of the veterans' plans, but would not comment further on how law enforcement will deal with demonstrators. Former U.S. Marine Michael A. Wood Jr is leading the effort along with Wesley Clark Jr, a writer whose father is retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark. U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii and a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has said on Twitter she will join the protesters on Sunday. The Army Corps, citing safety concerns, has ordered the evacuation of the primary protest camp by Dec. 5, but said it would not forcibly remove people from the land. Local law enforcement said on Tuesday they planned a blockade of the camp, but local and state officials later retreated, saying they would only check vehicles for certain prohibited supplies like propane, and possibly issue fines. Dalrymple on Wednesday said state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and there had been no plans to block food or other supplies from the camp. He also warned protesters that while emergency responders will try to reach anyone in need, that would be contingent on weather conditions. That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps.

TransCanada said in a statement it discovered the leak in the town of Amherst at 6 a.m. on Thursday after systems detected a drop in pressure, and that it was working with authorities as it investigates the cause. South Dakota Department of Environmental and Natural Resources spokesman Brian Walsh said the leak came from an underground pipeline and that it had been contained at the site. Trump has argued that the 830,000-barrel pipeline, which would serve as an extension of the existing Keystone system linking Alberta oil to U.S. refineries, will lower fuel prices, shore up national security and bring jobs. TransCanada and its supporters have also said the project would bring significant economic benefits, and could be operated safely. The Nebraska Public Service Commission, or PSC, is scheduled on Monday to announce a decision on whether the proposed pipeline route through the state is in the best interests of Nebraskans. It is not allowed to consider the potential of spills as the project already has an environmental permit. A rejection of the route would dim the chances the project gets built and would be a setback for both Trump and the Canadian energy sector, which says it needs more export routes to fetch better prices. TransCanada said the spill in South Dakota had led the company to shut the Keystone pipeline from Hardisty, Alberta, to Cushing, Oklahoma, and to Wood River and Patoka in Illinois. It said the southern leg of the system to the Gulf Coast remained operational. Thursday was the last day of the Canadian crude trading window, meaning volumes were thin, but traders said the sell-off could deepen if it appeared the pipeline would be down for some time, leading to a glut of crude in Alberta.

Ryan Hignight, a public affairs officer for the Corps, told Western Wire. Officials at the site are trying to identify how many vehicles still have owners and how many have been abandoned. Two weeks ago, the number of abandoned vehicles was estimated between 50 and 75, and at least one vehicle has already been found in the water, Keller told Western Wire.

The surge pump is connected to a tank that is used to store crude oil during regular operation of the line and it physically pushes oil through the line. The pipeline is not yet operational. Pipeline infrastructure expert Richard B. Kuprewicz told The Watertown Public Opinion that a leak this early may signal that the developer rushed through the construction process. ETP attributed the leak to a malfunction during the line fill process, which involves filling the 1,172-mile long pipeline with crude oil before beginning its operations. But Granado did not mention what caused the malfunction or if ETP will launch an internal investigation to find out. Granado told The Watertown Public Opinion the pipeline should be in service by June 1 as the company wraps up this line fill process. Since the beginning, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has been clear about its concerns regarding what a spill could do to local drinking water and sacred sites. The conversation has always been about when the pipeline leaks, not if. InsideClimate News reported today that ETP has no oil spill response plan for the portion of the pipeline with which opponents were most concerned: the place where the pipeline crosses the Missouri River.

The protestors of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota are about to get some major support. They launched the effort, called Veterans Stand for Standing Rock on Tuesday and after months of protesters clashing with the police over the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. The same day the group announced its initiative, state officials threatened to impose fines and block supplies from reaching a nearby camp where protesters reside. The veterans will protest through the December 5 deadline the Army Corps placed on the Sioux tribe to vacate. Though their protest will be nonviolent, they urge participants to bring body armor, gas masks, earplugs and shooting mufflers since protesters have been injured by police force. No drugs, alcohol or weapons will be allowed. Veterans Stand for Standing Rock also launched a GoFundMe in early November to raise money to provide food, transportation and supplies for protesters.

The Emergency Management Assistance Compact allows for professionals of all types to be deployed to other states, according to a spokesman for the Indiana Department of Homeland Security. When other states seek assistance, officials in Indiana evaluate the request and seek help if possible, the spokesman said. The state making the request must decide whether to accept any assistance Indiana offers and agree to reimburse the cost. A total of 37 police officers from Indiana have been sent to North Dakota, including 11 from several Northwest Indiana departments, the spokesman said. Officials have said Indiana tried to respond to such requests, but the state never knows when it might need assistance in return. Protesters remain The Associated Press reported Saturday protesters were staying near their encampment, following two days of confrontations that resulted in more than a hundred arrests and a barricade of burned-out vehicles blocking a North Dakota highway. A handful of people walked along the highway amid cloudy, chilly weather early Saturday as campfires burned at the nearby camp where hundreds of protesters are staying. About half a dozen law enforcement vehicles were parked along the highway near Cannon Ball, a town about 50 miles south of Bismarck. There was no immediate word on protesters' plans at the site, but an afternoon rally at the state Capitol in Bismarck was expected to feature landowners and community members encouraging supporters to take action however they can. Hundreds of people attended a similar rally in September. As many as 50 protesters gathered Friday behind heavy plywood sheets and the burned vehicles, facing a line of concrete barriers, military vehicles and police in riot gear. A small group of people, including some observers from Amnesty International, stayed into the evening after protest leaders asked people to return to camp. Standing Rock has waged a protest for months against the nearly 1,200-mile pipeline being developed across four states by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners. The pipeline is slated to carry North Dakota crude oil to a shipping point in Patoka, Illinois. The tribe argues that the pipeline is a threat to water and cultural sites. Protests encampments set up to support of the tribe have grown to thousands of people, with the effort drawing support from Native Americans and other people from around the country, including environmentalists and some celebrities. The protest escalated Sunday when demonstrators set up camp on private land along the pipeline's path that had recently been acquired by Energy Transfer Partners, The Associated Press reported. On Thursday, more than 140 people were arrested as law enforcement, bolstered by reinforcements from several states, moved in slowly to envelop the protesters. Kirchmeier said tribal representatives were later allowed onto the private property to remove teepees. Officers arrested one person, but no details were released. Following Thursday's eviction, some protesters worked overnight to create the two roadblocks. The camp cleared on Thursday was located just to the north of a more permanent, larger encampment on federally owned land that has been the main staging area for hundreds of protesters. Many returned to that site Friday to regroup and reunite with others who had been arrested the day before. There were no immediate plans to try to reoccupy the private land or to build a new camp elsewhere in the pipeline's path, protest camp spokesman Cody Hall said. A federal judge in September denied the tribe's request to block construction on the grounds that the Army Corps of Engineers improperly issued permits, and North Dakota officials say no culturally significant sites have been found in the area. But on the day the judge ruled, three federal agencies stepped in to order construction to halt on Army Corps-owned land around Lake Oahe, a wide spot of the Missouri River, while the Corps reviewed its decision-making. Meanwhile, construction has been allowed to continue on private land owned by the developer, with a goal of completion by the end of the year.

The president said both memos were subject to terms and conditions to be negotiated by the United States. Shares of Energy Transfer Partners and TransCanada both rose more than 3.5 percent on Tuesday. Trump has vowed to cancel Obama's Climate Action Plan and has threatened to pull out of or defund the Paris Climate Agreement, a landmark international accord aimed at reducing mankind's impact on global warming. The Keystone XL would bring oil from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska, where it would connect to an existing pipeline to bring the crude to Illinois. Former President Barack Obama refused to approve the cross-border project, saying the environmental review was not adequate in light of its route through the Sandhills ecosystem in Nebraska. Environmentalists oppose the project because it will encourage the development of Canada's oil sands, a type of oil resource that requires more energy to tap than conventional reserves. Backers of the project say it will reduce U.S. reliance on oil from the Middle East and allow the country to fulfill its energy needs from one of its closest allies. Keystone XL pipeline route, source: TransCanada View Related Chart Former Secretary of State John Kerry denied TransCanada a presidential permit in November 2015, saying the Keystone XL would not have a major impact on America's energy security, lower gas prices or contribute meaningfully to the economy. Dakota Access pipeline route, source: Energy Transfer Partners View Related Chart In a statement on Tuesday, TransCanada said the Keystone XL would create thousands of construction jobs and generate tens of millions of dollars in property taxes annually to counties along the proposed route. The project would employ a significant number of temporary construction workers during the building phase, though pipelines generally do not require much labor to operate in the long term. Obama also backed a delay to completion of the Dakota Access pipeline, which would bring oil from North Dakota to Illinois. Jo-Ellen Darcy, United States assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, said the best path forward was to explore alternative routes for the pipeline, something Energy Transfer Partners says it will not do. Members of the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes, as well as environmentalists from around the country, have fought the pipeline project on the grounds that it crosses beneath a lake that provides drinking water to Native Americans. They say the route beneath Lake Oahe puts the water source in jeopardy and would destroy sacred land. Tribe members and protesters have been camped out for months in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, in opposition to the pipeline. Legal challenges ahead Both projects could still face challenges, according to Bruce Huber, an associate professor of law at the University of Notre Dame who specializes in environmental, natural resources and energy law. The Keystone XL pipeline requires state approval, and Nebraska landowners fought a yearslong legal battle with TransCanada over the project. The company withdrew its application with the state's Public Service Commission in November 2015 after the State Department decision. Nebraska activists are likely to renew their protests, Huber said. Trump has less room to maneuver when it comes to the Dakota Access pipeline, he added. Should the Army Corps of Engineers' current environmental review pave the way for a new route, that plan will likely to face a lawsuit, Huber said.

Of the total spill, about 3,100 barrels leaked into the nearby Ash Coulee Creek, a small waterway that feeds the Little Missouri River, a tributary of the Missouri River. The spill has been contained. Last week, she noted that pipeline equipment did not detect the spill, possibly because the 2,400 barrel-per-day line runs intermittently. The leak occurred just 150 miles from the site of protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline, a crude line whose planned route was under the Missouri River. The Little Missouri feeds the main river upstream of the Dakota Pipeline crossing. The spill happened as pipeline companies such as Energy Transfer Partners, which saw the Dakota Access halted in December by the U.S. government, are trying to convince critics that their systems are the safest way to move crude and other products. The incident underscores concerns of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose land is adjacent to the planned pipeline route, and others who have said that a leak from the Dakota Access could contaminate drinking water or desecrate sacred lands. So far, the total number of hazardous liquids pipeline spills in 2016 is on track to fall short of 2015. As of Nov. 30, there were 354 spills, versus 462 for all of in 2015, according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). However, the percentage of spills releasing larger volumes of liquids has been higher this year, the data shows. About 16 percent of pipeline releases in 2016 involved 100 or more barrels of product, versus about 13 percent last year. The percentage involving 1,000 barrels or more has been slightly higher as well for 2016, at 3.4 percent, versus 3 percent last year. The two largest leaks this year have involved crude pipelines. In September, Sunoco Logistics, the operator of the Dakota Access, spilled 8,600 barrels of oil from its Permian Express II pipeline near Sweetwater, Texas. The company had previously been fined for violating welding practices on that line. In October, Enterprise Products Partners released over 7,600 barrels of oil from its Seaway Crude pipeline near Cushing, Oklahoma. Belle Fourche reported a 1,958 barrel leak of refined products on its system in Campbell County, Wyoming in 2011, and less than a month later suffered a 1,000 barrel spill of crude oil on its line near McKenzie, North Dakota.

Natasha Geiling Twitter Apr 16, 2018, 8:00 am SHARE Facebook Twitter Email SMS WhatsApp Share US veterans and Native Americans hold hands in prayer and solidarity on the road near Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on December 4, 2016 outside Cannon Ball, North Dakota. In the last few years, state lawmakers across the country have proposed bills that would impose harsh penalties on environmental protest, particularly protests aimed at delaying pipeline construction or shutting down existing pipeline infrastructure. In energy-rich states like Oklahoma and North Dakota, lawmakers have successfully passed bills prohibiting certain kinds of protest, from protests that block highways or traffic to protests that trespass onto property containing energy infrastructure. If passed, the bills would make it illegal to conspire to protest in certain instances, like when a protest would require trespass or some other kind of civil disobedience. Then came the crackdown. The current wave of state-level anti-pipeline protest legislation has largely been seen as a response to the Standing Rock protests of 2016, which brought thousands of indigenous and environmental groups to North Dakota in an attempt to stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The successful protests against the Dakota Access pipeline have inspired the protests now being staged against pipelines in Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. But they have also inspired backlash from the fossil fuel industry and allied political groups. The ALEC model bill included a provision for charges to be brought against an organization that is found to have conspired with individuals to disrupt critical infrastructure. Advertisement Now, in Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota, legislators have taken their anti-pipeline protest bills a step further than ALEC. Protesters in Pennsylvania would face similar charges for conspiring to enter a prohibited area under a bill introduced on March 26. In most instances, these bills cover crimes already penalized under state legal codes. Trespass is already illegal in these states, and prosecutors frequently charge protesters with conspiracy. What sets these bills apart, Cherry notes, is their narrow focus on energy infrastructure, as well as the proposed severity of criminal penalties."}, {"URL": "http://www.inquisitr.com/3748605/standing-rock-protest-is-just-the-latest-to-be-suppressed-with-violence/", "Timestamp": "20180919002751", "Sentences": "Eric Scott Pickard The Standing Rock protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline has, in recent days, been targeted by violence. Though there have been many incidents of injuries at the Standing Rock protest, among the most dramatic is the case of Sophia Wilansky, an environmental activist from New York. According to The Guardian, Wilansky reports being struck at close range with a concussion grenade. The injury is so severe that she may lose her arm, and in the best case scenario, will have very limited functionality in that arm. The escalation of violence at the Standing Rock protest, and the low level of mainstream media coverage of the protest itself, is deeply troubling. But, if we turn to the history of the United States, it is sadly far from unprecedented. Below are but a few dramatic examples in American history of protest movements being suppressed with violence. Many of these miners were immigrants from Greece, Serbia, and Italy, and they were striking for a 10-cent raise, an eight-hour work day, and the right to trade outside of the company-owned store, a company owned by the Rockefeller family. All of these demands were consistent with existing Colorado law, but these laws remained unenforced. The companies had initially hired private security to suppress the protest, something that has also occurred at the Standing Rock protest when private security forces unleashed attack dogs on protesters. By April 20, however, the strike had dragged on for months, and striking miners around Ludlow were encamped with their families around the mining sites, similar to at Standing Rock. The Colorado National Guard had been called in, and that day a confrontation occurred, described in some depth in a piece in The New Yorker. In an attempt to evict the camp, the National Guard set it ablaze and exchanged gunfire with the strikers. By dawn, 66 men, women, and children lay dead. Two of the women and 11 children were found burned to death in an infirmary. Law enforcement plans to evict the Standing Rock protest camp December 5. Wounded Knee, 1973 In an incident of particular relevance to the Standing Rock protest, members of the American Indian Movement occupied Wounded Knee at the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota for 71 days in 1973. The American Indian Movement had staged several occupations in the previous years in protest of the failure of the federal government to uphold treaties signed with indigenous tribes. Second, Pine Ridge was among the poorest places in the United States. The protesters surrendered on the condition that their issues would be addressed. On February 17, a protester named Jimmy Lee Jackson was shot and killed by an Alabama state trooper at a peaceful demonstration near the county courthouse. In response, a peaceful march was scheduled from Selma to the state capitol of Montgomery on Sunday, March 7. The march got as far as the Edmund Pettus Bridge over the Alabama river on their journey. There they were met by local police and Alabama state troopers, who ordered them to turn around. When they refused, law enforcement fired tear gas into the crowd and charged them with clubs. In the ensuing violence, more than 50 protesters were hospitalized, according to Black Past. Protests had been going for several days on the campus and in the city of Kent proper, and the Ohio National Guard had been called in. On May 4, the National Guard troops lined up along a hill above the location of the protest and called on the students to disperse. When the students refused, the Guardsmen threw tear gas into the crowd. Reports indicate that the protesters threw the tear gas canisters back, perhaps along with stones. The National Guard then opened fire with live ammunition into the crowd, killing four and wounding nine, according to CBS News. These above are only a few of the many such incidents throughout the United States history. The Standing Rock protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline has now joined their ranks.

Natasha Geiling Twitter Apr 16, 2018, 8:00 am SHARE Facebook Twitter Email SMS WhatsApp Share US veterans and Native Americans hold hands in prayer and solidarity on the road near Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on December 4, 2016 outside Cannon Ball, North Dakota. In the last few years, state lawmakers across the country have proposed bills that would impose harsh penalties on environmental protest, particularly protests aimed at delaying pipeline construction or shutting down existing pipeline infrastructure. In energy-rich states like Oklahoma and North Dakota, lawmakers have successfully passed bills prohibiting certain kinds of protest, from protests that block highways or traffic to protests that trespass onto property containing energy infrastructure. If passed, the bills would make it illegal to conspire to protest in certain instances, like when a protest would require trespass or some other kind of civil disobedience. Then came the crackdown. The current wave of state-level anti-pipeline protest legislation has largely been seen as a response to the Standing Rock protests of 2016, which brought thousands of indigenous and environmental groups to North Dakota in an attempt to stop construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The successful protests against the Dakota Access pipeline have inspired the protests now being staged against pipelines in Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and elsewhere. But they have also inspired backlash from the fossil fuel industry and allied political groups. The ALEC model bill included a provision for charges to be brought against an organization that is found to have conspired with individuals to disrupt critical infrastructure. Advertisement Now, in Louisiana, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota, legislators have taken their anti-pipeline protest bills a step further than ALEC. Protesters in Pennsylvania would face similar charges for conspiring to enter a prohibited area under a bill introduced on March 26. In most instances, these bills cover crimes already penalized under state legal codes. Trespass is already illegal in these states, and prosecutors frequently charge protesters with conspiracy. What sets these bills apart, Cherry notes, is their narrow focus on energy infrastructure, as well as the proposed severity of criminal penalties."}, {"URL": "http://earthfirstjournal.org/newswire/2017/06/15/the-standing-rock-sioux-claim-victory-and-vindication-in-court/", "Timestamp": "20180918230836", "Sentences": "Monkeywrenching Security Zines Read.

Instead, Boasberg asked attorneys to appear before him again and make a new set of arguments about whether the pipeline should operate. The tribe faces a mixed result: The ruling may establish some important precedents, particularly around environmental justice and treaty rights. Energy Transfer Partners, which owns and operates the pipeline, did not respond to a request for comment before publication. A representative for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers could not be reached. The Dakota Access pipeline runs 1,100 miles across much of the Great Plains, connecting the Bakken oil formation in North Dakota to a refinery and second pipeline in Illinois. Oil began flowing through the pipeline earlier this month. By late October, Standing Rock had become the largest and most high-profile Native protest in the United States in four decades. First, he said, the Standing Rock Sioux are assured certain hunting and fishing rights in their most recent treaty with the U.S. government. This emphasis on consideration points to the broader nature of the legal fight: This case is not about how the pipeline may harm Standing Rock, but whether the Corps adequately studied and reported on those harms before approving it in the first place. According to federal regulation, every major project constructed near a poor community, community of color, or Native American reservation must be studied on environmental-justice grounds. The Corps shrugged off many of these rules, arguing that no affected group lived within a half-mile of the pipeline route. The Corps was technically correct. The Dakota Access pipeline runs 0.55 miles north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. With the project so far along, she said it was unclear if any procedural problem could convince Boasberg to temporarily shut down the project. The tribe was not successful on every claim. The judge ruled that the Corps did not violate administrative law when it quickly approved the pipeline earlier this year. The complicated legal history of the Dakota Access pipeline has stemmed from one important conflict: The pipeline mostly runs across private land, allowing Energy Transfer Partners to quickly secure permission and construct most of it last year. But it also must cross the Missouri River, a federal waterway controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. But less than two months later, in early September, the Obama administration stepped in and asked Energy Transfer Partners to voluntarily stop work on the project. President Barack Obama announced the result of this review in early December 2016, when the administration revoked the permit entirely. It also ordered Energy Transfer Partners and the U.S. Army Corps to study whether the pipeline could be re-routed. Finally, almost two months later and on his fifth day in office, President Donald Trump reversed this order and granted approval for the pipeline.

Morton County Sheriff's Office The clash comes days after organizers held coordinated demonstrations across the country to protest a 1,170-mile oil pipeline that has generated the largest American Indian protest movement in modern history. Thousands of people have flocked to North Dakota, where the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe argues that the proposed pipeline could permanently contaminate its water source, the Missouri River, as well as desecrate sacred sites. Energy Transfer Partners, which is behind the pipeline, has said that it has taken measures to prevent such leaks and that the pipeline is far safer than transporting oil with trucks or trains.

A group of 31 environmental organizations sent a joint letter to the White House asking President Obama to halt construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a 1,168-mile oil pipeline that would connect Bakken oil to refineries in Illinois.

During the protest, almost 400 were arrested after zip-tieing themselves to the White House fence. In January, Trump had breathed new life into the pipeline project that had been stopped under Obama, asking TransCanada to submit a new application. The pipeline still has to be approved by the Nebraska Public Service Commission and local landowners, but granting the permit clears the path for final approval. Keystone XL would be another escalation in furthering an unfolding climate disaster, piping an additional 830,000 barrels of oil a day from the Alberta tar sands into the U.S. for processing. Oil from tar sands is some of the dirtiest, most carbon polluting oil on the planet. This pipeline would also trample on treaty rights of the Sioux, going through treaty lands and near several other tribal reservations. Keystone XL would cross the Ogallala Aquifer, which is one of the country's largest sources of freshwater. A spill in the aquifer would threaten the drinking water for millions of Americans as well as the livelihood of local ranchers and farmers. Hundreds of thousands of people have participated in active resistance to Keystone XL and DAPL. More than a thousand sat in at the White House in mass arrests to stop Keystone XL in just one of many protest actions in recent years. Thousands heroically stood up to vicious police assaults on the Standing Rock Reservation to stop DAPL. Hundreds of Native tribes sent representatives to Standing Rock in an unprecedented action to protect Standing Rock Sioux treaty rights and the water and land. The resistance contributed to helping stop production of Keystone XL for years and for more than a year for DAPL, which shamefully now is being completed. Map shows the Keystone XL Pipeline route (long dotted line) going through the Ogallala Aquifer in Nebraska. This natural underground water reservoir is one of the largest in the world. Contaminating the aquifer from leaks in the pipeline is a real and dangerous possibility. They have promised to resist this in the courts, as well as with campaigns and in the streets. Approval of Keystone XL and DAPL is part of a savage war on the environment that this regime has radically escalated, with the goal of eliminating any restraints on capitalist profit-making and plunder of resources, and arrogantly expanding U.S. global domination, including over energy resources. This system and those who rule over it are not capable of carrying out economic development to meet the needs of the people now, while balancing that with the needs of future generations and requirements of safeguarding the environment.

Some opponents of the controversial tar sands pipeline have suggested this, but more and more people inside the oil industry are saying time has passed by the project. TransCanada, the company seeking to build the pipeline, acknowledged Friday that the project might be abandoned. The legal courtlike hearings to determine whether the 275-mile route will be approved by the Nebraska Public Service Commission are scheduled from Aug. 7 to 11 in Lincoln. A company spokesman said he could not say whether oil producers are turning away from the XL, as is being reported, because the information is proprietary. But Matt John of TransCanada said that talks with producers continue and the company remains optimistic the 36-inch pipeline from Alberta to a junction at Steele City, Nebraska, will be built. Much has changed since the Keystone XL was first proposed in 2008. Meanwhile, U.S. production of oil has taken off, rising 77 percent between 2008 and 2016 due to the advent of fracking. And other pipelines have been proposed and built to transport oil. And its Keystone pipeline, which crosses eastern Nebraska, has been hauling crude since June of 2010. At one time the XL was going to haul 100,000 barrels of U.S. oil a day from fields in Montana and North Dakota. But pipeline capacity from North Dakota has increased 500 percent in the past decade. Three other pipelines from Canada have been proposed, and some analysts think that, given the opposition in the U.S. to the Keystone XL and the expected legal battles, at least two of them are on a faster track than the nine-year-old XL, and will fulfill any need for new pipelines. He said that while there could be an oversupply of pipelines to the mid-2020s, there is a need for heavy crude oil on the Gulf Coast. He added that of the three leading pipelines, the Trans Mountain likely had the most upside, since it would service new markets in Asia. With a worldwide glut of oil, there are just cheaper and easier sources of oil elsewhere. Forecasts for oil production in the oil sands regions have fallen dramatically since oil prices plummeted in 2014. XL critics, including in the oil industry, point out that TransCanada has bet on some losers in the past. The company was picked by then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to build an 800-mile natural gas pipeline there. But by 2014, natural gas was cheap and plentiful and the project was dead. John, the TransCanada spokesman, said those projects were different, and the company still sees customer need for the Keystone XL. Nebraska dropped out of the multistate compact that was determined to build the dump in Boyd County. Time had passed it by, and other repositories were sufficient. Of course, things could change, oil analysts said. If the worldwide supply of oil is disrupted, particularly the flow of heavy crude oil from strife-torn Venezuela, oil prices would skyrocket, brightening the outlook for the Keystone XL. But right now, observers like Share, the oil industry magazine editor, say that oil producers are shying away from signing up the 20-year contracts required to use and, more importantly, finance the pipeline. 402-473-9584 Sign up for World-Herald news alerts Be the first to know when news happens.

The activists tell an emotionally charged tale of greed, racism and misbehavior by corporate and government officials. But the real story of the Dakota Access Pipeline was revealed in court documents in September, and it is nothing like the activists' tale. In fact, it is the complete opposite. Some Fargo restaurants to get closer watch from inspectors The record shows that Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the pipeline, spent years working diligently with federal, state and local officials to route the pipeline safely and with the fewest possible disruptions. The contrast between the protesters' claims and the facts on record is stunning. In fact, project leaders participated in 559 meetings with community leaders, local officials and organizations to listen to concerns and fine-tune the route. The company asked for, and received, a tougher federal permitting process at sites along the Missouri River. This more difficult procedure included a mandated review of each water crossing's potential effect on historical artifacts and locations. Protesters claim that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to consult tribal leaders as required by federal law. The record shows that the corps held 389 meetings with 55 tribes. Corps officials met many times with leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which initiated the lawsuit and the protests. Complete coverage of the Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters claim that the Standing Rock Sioux pursued meetings with an unresponsive Army Corps of Engineers. Court records show that the roles in that story were in fact reversed. The corps alerted the tribe to the pipeline permit application in the fall of 2014 and repeatedly requested comments from and meetings with tribal leaders, only to be rebuffed over and over. Tribal leaders ignored requests for comment and canceled meetings multiple times. At a planned meeting the next month, the tribe took the pipeline off the agenda and refused to discuss it. This stonewalling by tribal leaders continued for a year and a half. Typical of the misinformation spread during the protests is a comment made by Jesse Jackson, who recently joined the activists in North Dakota. Man dead from apparent gunshot wound following Moorhead apartment standoff He did not mention, possibly because he did not know, that the company is paying to relocate the tribe's water intake to a new spot 70 miles from the location of the contested pipeline crossing. The court record reveals that the Standing Rock Sioux refused to meet with corps officials to discuss the route until after site work had begun. It documented the legal and proper approval process the corps used to permit all of the contested construction sites the tribe claimed were improperly permitted. It even documented evidence that the corps had exceeded the minimum legal requirements during its earnest and lengthy efforts to receive the input of tribal leaders on the pipeline.

This story was originally published by High Country News and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration. As of this week, Bakken oil is expected to flow through the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. This development comes as court proceedings continue over the high-profile battle over the pipeline that drew thousands of protestors to North Dakota last year. As law enforcement officers and Indigenous activists faced off near the construction site, the conflict played out in real time on social media, capturing international attention. A ruling is likely still several weeks away. The tribes have tried for temporary restraining orders to stop the flow of oil until the case is decided, but judges have rejected those as well. Dakota Access, LLC, is required to update the court weekly on whether the pipeline operations have begun; on March 20, the company said they expected oil to flow this week.

Although the Obama administration had put DAPL on hold in December and called for further environmental review, then-President-elect Donald Trump vowed to push the project through once he took office. And recent legal proceedings remind us how difficult it is for tribes to argue for religious freedom in court. RFRA has an unreliable track record for tribes in court. Congress created the law in 1993 in part as a response to two cases in which courts sided with the government. In 1988 Lyng vs. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association allowed the Forest Service to construct a logging road in California that would have disrupted an area sacred to several tribes. In 1990 Employment Division vs. Smith allowed two Native Americans in Oregon to be fired for failing a drug test because they had used peyote as an element of religious ceremony. The most recent major failure was the case of the Snowbowl ski resort in Arizona in which reclaimed wastewater was being used to make snow on mountains sacred to several tribes. The tribes argued a violation of RFRA and ultimately lost. RFRA has an unreliable track record for tribes in court. RFRA has, however, worked for corporations such as Hobby Lobby. Part of the challenge for tribes, says University of Colorado law professor Charles Wilkinson, is one of translation. In court in February, Judge James Boasberg reportedly questioned how a pipeline would desecrate the Missouri River if the oil itself never touched the water. The most lasting impact of the Dakota Access battle might be greater federal attention to the process through which the U.S. government is supposed to consult tribal governments about proposed infrastructure projects that might impact those nations, says Wilkinson. A 38-page memo from former Obama administration Interior Solicitor Hilary Tompkins in December described in detail the ways in which the government failed to consult tribes that may be affected by the pipeline. That report requested further action from several federal agencies by April 2017, in establishing better consultation processes.

Others say they will stay and fight the Army Corps of Engineers, which decided last week to allow completion of the 1,172-mile pipeline. The drilling began last week. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has joined a motion by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe to halt the drilling. Horses still run free in the camp. Small packs of dogs dart about, tussling in the snow, their barks drowned out by the incessant whine of a snowmobile that wends its way through the slushy mess. Everything is white, brown, gray. The only flashes of color come from weatherworn tribal flags, banners that were jubilantly raised last summer and now, some in tatters, snap to and fro in the ever-changing wind. One day soon, all of this will be gone: the tepees packed away, the yurts pulled down, the abandoned tents and sleeping bags and boxes of belongings scraped up by bulldozers into waiting dumpsters and hauled off to landfills.

Some activists have called for more protesters to come out to the site, but the Standing Rock tribe has discouraged that, asking that opposition be directed at the local level and at a March 10 march planned for Native American rights in Washington. The tribe welcomed the 200 or so Native tribes that gathered here in late summer and fall to help their cause, and it welcomed the national and international support that followed.

TransCanada, the pipeline company, later issued a short statement that did not say whether it would move forward with construction, leaving people on both sides of the issue unsure of how to react. Over the course of two presidencies, Democrats and environmentalists have stood against the pipeline at every turn, making it a potent emblem of a broader battle to stave off climate change and protect drinking water, an effort that included the mobilization of thousands of protesters last year to oppose a different pipeline in North Dakota. Just as persistently, Republicans, business groups and labor unions have long pressed the Keystone XL proposal as a proxy for wider goals of creating jobs and expanding the energy sector. The newly approved route for the pipeline is slightly longer and brings potential challenges for the company, which would need to negotiate new easements with landowners not along the preferred route. TransCanada had already paid many landowners along the preferred route for access to their properties. TransCanada officials declined an interview request. Later, President Barack Obama used a case pending before the Nebraska Supreme Court as a reason to delay deciding on a federal permit. Mr. Obama later rejected that permit, citing climate change, but Nebraska opponents remobilized this year when Mr. Trump resurrected the project. But supporters of the project have long touted its economic benefits, and seemed to win over the majority of the Nebraska Public Service Commission, the regulatory board that voted 3-2 to approve the alternate route. But in between, the alternate route veers east to follow the path of an existing pipeline, a switch that regulators say could make emergency responses to either pipeline more efficient. Opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline, including many farmers and ranchers, had packed the small hearing room on Monday for the announcement. When the vote was tallied, some landowners learned that their land would no longer be on the pipeline route and voiced relief. Others discovered that a path through their property had been approved. Even before the decision, some questioned whether there would still be enough interest among oil shippers to support the pipeline. But TransCanada reiterated its support of the project in early November. But now the company must consider the new route, the potential for new legal challenges and a different political landscape.

But on Tuesday, Trump signed a series of directives aimed at speeding up the pipeline's approval process. Those reviews are seen by many government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as environmentalists, as cornerstones to ensuring the environment is taken into account when new construction projects are ordered. The project is a proposed 1,172-mile pipe that would shuttle half a million barrels of North Dakota-produced oil to refining markets in Illinois. Proponents of the pipeline say it would lessen dependence on foreign oil while creating jobs and growing domestic industry. As proposed, the pipeline would pass through North Dakota's Lake Oahe, a burial site sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux and a major source of drinking water for the community. But as I reported in December, it may have been too early to celebrate. Here's why environmentalists and people who live and work near the proposed pipeline are so concerned. Contaminated water is a massive health problem Should the Dakota Access pipeline leak or burst, the effects could be devastating. And leak pipelines do. An average of 121 accidents happened in both 2013 and 2014. In addition, people who had used contaminated water for bathing or laundry appeared to experience more skin problems, ranging from mild rashes to severe and lasting eczema and malignant skin cancers. Passed in 1970, NEPA basically ensures that the government considers the potential environmental effects of any federal project, like a new highway or airport, before building it. The Standing Rock Sioux say that the Dakota Access pipeline's review process was not done properly. In a lawsuit it filed in July against the Army Corps of Engineers, the tribe said the permit process was rushed and undertaken largely without its input. If the pipeline were to leak or burst, it would send oil deep into the Missouri River, the Standing Rock Sioux's primary source of water, which the tribe relies on for everything from bathing to drinking. For that reason, the tribe says the Army Corps of Engineers could violate not just one, but two laws: NEPA and the Clean Water Act. Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, waits to speak against the Dakota Access oil pipeline during the Human Rights Council at the UN in Geneva, Switzerland, on September 20. Trump also owned stock in Energy Transfer Partners, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission, The New York Times reported on Tuesday. The Times added that a Trump spokesperson said last month that Trump had sold all of his stock during the summer, yet Trump has failed to provide any documentation proving the sale.

I spoke with Dave Rosencranz, the Dakotas Area manger for the Federal Bureau of Reclamation, and he told me that currently the Standing Rock community is being served by two Missouri River water intakes but that the Fort Yates intake, which is nearest the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing, is slated to be shut down. He told me the Mobridge intake and treatment plant are already operating and serving a part of the Standing Rock community, but will hopefully soon be serving all of it.

(Reuters) - A Minnesota regulator on Thursday approved a certificate of need for Enbridge Inc to rebuild its Line 3 oil pipeline, angering environmentalists but offering hope to Western Canadian oil producers that have struggled to move crude oil to refiners. An activist opposing the Enbridge Line 3 oil pipeline, dangles from a steel structure erected outside the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission office in St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S., June 28, 2018. Shares of Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge closed up 3.7 percent in Toronto. Pipeline bottlenecks have steepened a price discount for Western Canadian heavy crude this year. Refiners in Minnesota and surrounding states say Line 3 is necessary to increase crude supplies. Shouts from Native Americans and environmental activists interrupted the meeting. Environmental groups and some indigenous communities oppose the project over concerns about spills and impact on tribal wild rice harvesting areas. The Standing Rock tribe led opposition in 2016 to the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, one of the most bitterly contested energy projects in years. It was eventually built. The coalition of Line 3 opponents is likely to formally request that the commission reconsider its approval, said Joe Plumer, lawyer for White Earth Nation. He said he continues to expect the rebuilt pipeline to begin service in the second half of 2019. Line 3, which began service in 1968, operates at half its capacity. Its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day. Several commissioners voiced doubts that demand for crude oil and refined products such as gasoline would grow enough to warrant the pipeline. The rebuilt Line 3 will follow the existing pipeline path partway through Minnesota, before veering south to bypass Leech Lake reserve and avoid a need to shut down the pipeline for up to one year during construction. The path of a short stretch near Fond du Lac reserve will be determined by negotiations between the tribe and Enbridge. Fond du Lac lawyer Seth Bichler told the commission that the tribes preferred a longer route to the south that would avoid more sensitive land. Recognized parties, including Enbridge, environmental and indigenous groups, have 20 days from the time a written order is issued - likely in a couple of weeks - to ask the commission to reconsider. Line 3 also requires 29 additional permits from local, state and federal levels, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton said in a statement.

The US Army says alternative routes need to be considered for an oil pipeline that was to cross native lands and place water sources at risk. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is declaring victory after the United States Army announced Sunday (04.12.2016) that it will not allow construction to begin on a planned pipeline project through Native American lands. But with the unprecedented decision likely to be reversed by the incoming administration of president-elect Donald Trump, environmentalists are torn over whether to tell protesters at the massive protest camp that has built up in a tribal area over past months to stand down. The Dakota Access Pipeline was approved several months ago, with a plan to carry crude from the Bakken oil fields in western North Dakota to Southern Illinois. Environmentalists said the pipeline threatened water supplies Since summer, a large camp of protesters has grown at the reservation - it now numbers thousands of people. Most recently, several hundred veterans joined the protest. Last week, Trump had said that he supports finishing the pipeline, which is nearly complete aside from the section through the Indian reservation. But the army's decision is not final, and could be easily reversed by the next administration. Trump owns stock in the company, but has insisted that will not affect his decision on the project. Company refuses to reroute For some, the government's denial set an unsettling precedent, as Energy Transfer Partners had undergone all necessary reviews and permitting processes. Kevin Cramer, North Dakota's single congressional representative and a Trump supporter, suggested that Trump will reverse the decision after he is inaugurated. Studies for alternative routes will likely take several months. Activists point to the wide reach of social media for getting the word out. Romantic notions around Native American culture may also have helped garner support for the struggle The protest also linked social justice and environmental concerns, tapping a broad base of activists, both young and old. Also the burgeoning climate protection movement was activated, as the pipeline represents fossil fuel development. In the long term, the camp won't be going anywhere, Molina concluded, as an eco-village is being built on tribal land as a permanent model for living sustainably in the face of fossil fuel extraction and devastation.

That comes a day after pipeline opponents plan a rally in Lincoln and pipeline construction workers gather for a barbecue in Omaha. The 275-mile route submitted by TransCanada is the same pathway that was approved by a different state agency, the Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality, back in 2013. So expect some drama next week, along with plenty of legal objections from lawyers representing landowners and groups opposed to the pipeline. And expect some uncertainty. This is the first time the low-profile commission, which typically rules on issues concerning telephone and cellphone service, has ever sat in judgment over an oil pipeline. It will, without a doubt, be the highest-profile action the PSC has taken, drawing national attention. Rulings earlier this week by a retired judge from Lincoln who will be the hearing officer severely restricted what issues can be presented. Those rulings may serve to shorten the hearings, which are scheduled to extend as late as 9 p.m. each day. Flowers did allow discussion about the impact on property values and soil disturbance in laying the 36-inch pipeline, which would be buried 4 feet deep to allow farming and grazing to resume above it. Attorneys will get to cross-examine each witness, as would happen in a court hearing. However, the length of each day will be dictated by the amount of testimony and cross-examination that day. So hearings could end earlier, and the hearings might not take all five days. Labor unions that support the pipeline will testify last.

Multiple fires had been set to debris on the bridge, and people were throwing Molotov cocktails at police. Two officers received minor injuries after being hit by logs and other debris, according to the Morton County Sheriff's Department. The bridge standoff remained Friday, but protesters had thinned out in the early afternoon. Lelani Running Bear, of Standing Rock, sat on a hill next to the bridge, watching the protesters and police. She eyed a group of demonstrators who were revving their trucks and blasting loud music. People at the main camp reported injuries among protesters who were at the scene of the clash on Thursday. Police used pepper spray, bean bag and sponge rounds, as well as a Taser. One person was left with rib cage bruises from bean bag bullets, and another young woman apparently had a bone in her arm rebroken. A horse was reportedly shot and killed by police, according to several protesters. However, no remains were recovered. At Backwater Bridge, people set numerous fires to vehicles and other debris, including nine vehicles and construction equipment. The burnt-out vehicles remained there Friday. Morton County Sheriff's Office indicated 69 vehicles were towed from the scene. During altercations on Thursday, some protesters urged people to remain peaceful and prayerful, while others threw logs, water bottles and rocks at officers. Braun said many elders at the camp are calling for the youth to stand down. Johanna Holy Elk Face, who lives in Denver but is originally from Standing Rock, was among the protesters arrested Thursday. She was taken to Morton County jail, but released after a couple of hours. Holy Elk Face said police wrote numbers on both of her arms after she was arrested. One number was used to identify her belongings, she said. Authorities also reported two incidents of shots fired Thursday afternoon, but one may have been a flare gun used to set a vehicle on fire, according to Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier. One woman allegedly fired a handgun three times toward police and was arrested. An armed man, who was allegedly run off the road by protesters, was not shot in the hand as initially indicated by the Morton County Sheriff's Department. Protesters have alleged that the man was a Dakota Access Pipeline security contractor and pointed to insurance documents they say were found in the truck he was driving. Many, who were housed Thursday night in various county jails, including Burleigh, Morton, Cass, McLean and Mercer, were processed at the Morton County Courthouse throughout Friday. While every protester taking part in the raucous demonstration of the Dakota Access Pipeline on Thursday could have been arrested, Capt. Bryan Niewind, of the North Dakota Highway Patrol, said that only 142 were taken into custody. As of 4:40 p.m. Friday, about 108 people had been charged. Of those, 11 are residents of North Dakota and the remainder are from out of state. More serious charges were issued against Sydney Nicole Johnson, of Chillicothe, Ohio, who was charged with reckless endangerment. Alexander Briggs, of Troy, N.Y., was charged with criminal trespass. Holy Elk Face said some protesters started fighting with each other, and she got pushed. Holy Elk Face was arrested Thursday afternoon.

The spill came from a six-inch pipeline built in the 1980s, which transports 1,000 barrels of oil per day. The oil spill contaminated the Ash Coulee Creek, but did not reach the Little Missouri River, according to Bill Suess, a spill investigation manager for NDDoH. The cause of the pipeline spill is under investigation. The oil spill happened some 170 miles northwest of Cannon Ball, North Dakota, the site of the gathering of American Indian and allies resistance to the Dakota Access pipeline. The spill personifies exactly the reason they have fought for many months to stop the Dakota Access pipeline. Previously, he served as editor of the Native News Network.

American billionaires are going to get every ounce of oil & coal & gas out of the ground, and the environment be damned as far as they are concerned, before they turn to renewable energy. While the rest of the world is looking at America and wondering what kind of mass psychosis we are suffering from that we not only are so far behind them in recognizing the problem of global warming, but that we are so self destructively ignorant as to elect a man who says climate change is a hoax invented by the Chinese. America has bought the booby prize at the ballot box, and now they will pay for it with the destruction of their land by the very people they gave away their allegiance to. Greed, ignorance, and hatred and fear are the attributes of the so called civilized American populace, that the rest of the world will know them by. Susan 2 years ago Thanks Levi for keeping us undated. TribalMember and Proud of it. 2 years ago This is very disheartening to hear about, which was first posted on the Sacred Stone Camp Facebook page as well as the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Facebook page. The creek on my way to work is now freezing over but it is one which during these past few months, had been given many good thoughts with an arm stretched out towards it while driving past daily. It is a sad, mournful time to know that the creatures which once lived in the waters that become contaminated can no longer exist.

Last week, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault and the tribal council voted to disband the camps. On Tuesday, President Trump signed orders to try to fast-track not only the Dakota Access pipeline construction but also to restart the Keystone XL. Activists across the nation immediately protested. Journalist Jenni Monet, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna in New Mexico, has been covering the Standing Rock situation since last summer and has been at the camps since early December. I asked Monet to describe how the water protectors are taking this succession of events. The memos, while more symbolic than substantive, have helped set a tone in his administration, promoting a fast-tracked system toward implementation of such energy projects, as opposed to a thorough Environmental Impact Statement study and review process that is only beginning with regard to the Dakota Access pipeline. The tribe feels any violation of this step is unlawful and disregards treaty rights that have been acknowledged by the U.S. Army. Among the network of encampments, it was business as usual, with people chopping wood and cleaning up the massive amounts of debris that others have left behind. Perhaps two dozen people walked to the Backwater Bridge blockade to pray, a demonstration that lasted less than an hour. And by late afternoon, it appeared that several cities worldwide had heeded this call. As seen on Facebook, live streams captured mass demonstrations from coast to coast. In Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and New York, to name a few. And so, the tribe has been fully prepared for a Trump challenge. As early as the first week of January, Chairman Archambault along with state and environmental officials began expressing concern over a known flood plain come spring where the majority of water protectors remain camped out, including the Oceti Sakowin and Rosebud camps. Yet, the founder of the Sacred Stone camp and Standing Rock tribal member, LaDonna Allard, has said that she will keep her camp open. According to Allard, the entire encampment, where as many as 1,500 people have lived at one time, is held on lands owned privately by her and her extended family. You are welcome to come back and you are welcome to come stand with us. The tribe has been fully prepared for a Trump challenge. But it seems the majority of water protectors are seeking ways to stay. The 44-year-old California man arrived in August battling drug addiction. That must be a low point for morale and organization. I have seen this movement at its height, in terms of people power. And with the number of people who remain at the camps presently, I often find myself wondering whether the dynamics were similar to before the movement grew, in the early summer months. I can only speak to the fact that the winter months have brought a sense of survival I have not yet witnessed until now. Propane trucks arrive on Fridays and the lines are long to fill them up. People stand sometimes three hours or longer to wait to fill their small tanks to last them for the week. One delivery arrived in the morning and the supplies were gone within a couple of hours. Despite the executive memos and the call to leave, there are many people in the camps who are making plans to move elsewhere, either to Sacred Stone or onto private lands in the surrounding area. The notion is that as long as the DAPL crews remain, so too will the water protectors. No Paywall. No Ads. Just Readers Like You. You can help fund powerful stories to light the way forward.

Many activists traveled to Washington, D.C., from Standing Rock, where they had been camping out for months in opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline. Many are statutory and the legislation that created them cannot be swept aside by an executive order. Trump said that both pipeline projects would be subject to renegotiation. In an Oval Office signing before reporters, the president hinted at a possible new wrinkle. He said he would want any new projects to make use of American steel, though that requirement is not mentioned in his executive order. The orders will likely have an immediate impact in North Dakota, where the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners wants to complete the final 1,100-foot piece of the 1,172-mile pipeline route that runs under Lake Oahe. The pipeline would carry oil from the booming shale oil reserves in North Dakota to refineries and pipeline networks in Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other Native American groups have been protesting the project, which they say would imperil their water supplies and disturb sacred burial and archaeological sites. The Army Corp of Engineers called a halt to the project in December to consider alternative routes. The tribe is expected to return to court in a bid to block the project. The camp is in a flood plain, and heavy snow could pose dangers when it starts melting. TransCanada, the Calgary-based project owner, has said it would be interested in reviving the pipeline. Originally, TransCanada had planned to get about 65 percent of the steel pipe from U.S. manufacturers but other supplies from Canada. We build the pipelines, we want to build the pipe. President Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. During the daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer discussed the timeline for the Keystone XL pipeline project. (Reuters) As news of the move surfaced Tuesday morning, oil industry officials hailed it as overdue. Environmentalists, by contrast, vowed to continue to fight the two pipelines. Americans have tended to favor the Keystone XL project even as Obama rejected it. Earlier Post-ABC surveys found that Americans widely expected the project to create a significant amount of jobs, but that they were divided on whether it would pose a significant environmental risk.

Donald Trump's spokesman says the self-proclaimed billionaire will consider restarting a project to push an oil pipeline under a Native American tribe's water supply. Trump planned to meet with North Dakota Representative Kevin Cramer, a fellow Republican who criticized Sunday's decision by the US Army Corps of Engineers to deny the final permit for the pipeline.

Nov. 23, 2016 President-elect Donald J. Trump, however, has taken a different view of the project and said as recently as last week that he supported finishing the 1,170-mile pipeline, which crosses four states and is almost complete. Mr. Trump owns stock in the company building the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, but he has said that his support has nothing to do with his investment. There was no immediate response from Energy Transfer Partners, but its chief executive, Kelcy Warren, has said that the company was unwilling to reroute the pipeline, which is intended to transport as much as 550,000 barrels of oil a day from the oil fields of western North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois. Reaction was swift on both sides, with environmental groups like Greenpeace praising the decision.

Now, a group of advisers to President-elect Donald Trump on Native American issues wants to free those resources from what they call a suffocating federal bureaucracy that holds title to 56 million acres of tribal lands, two chairmen of the coalition told Reuters in exclusive interviews. The tribes have rights to use the land, but they do not own it. They can drill it and reap the profits, but only under regulations that are far more burdensome than those applied to private property. Trump's transition team did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The plan dovetails with Trump's larger aim of slashing regulation to boost energy production. It could deeply divide Native American leaders, who hold a range of opinions on the proper balance between development and conservation. Many Native Americans view such efforts as a violation of tribal self-determination and culture. Reservations governed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs are intended in part to keep Native American lands off the private real estate market, preventing sales to non-Indians. An official at the Bureau of Indian Affairs did not respond to a request for comment. The legal underpinnings for reservations date to treaties made between 1778 and 1871 to end wars between indigenous Indians and European settlers. Tribal governments decide how land and resources are allotted among tribe members. One idea is to limit sales to non-Indian buyers, said Ross Swimmer, a co-chair on Trump's advisory coalition and an ex-chief of the Cherokee nation who worked on Indian affairs in the Reagan administration. On Sunday, amid rising opposition, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday said it had denied a permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline project, citing a need to explore alternate routes. The Trump transition team has expressed support for the pipeline, however, and his administration could revisit the decision once it takes office in January. Tribes and their members could potentially reap vast wealth from more easily tapping resources beneath reservations. In 2008, the Bureau of Indian Affairs testified before Congress that reservations contained about 20 percent of untapped oil and gas reserves in the U.S. Deregulation could also benefit private oil drillers including Devon Energy Corp., Occidental Petroleum, BP and others that have sought to develop leases on reservations through deals with tribal governments. Those companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump's transition team commissioned the 27-member Native American Affairs Coalition to draw up a list of proposals to guide his Indian policy on issues ranging from energy to health care and education. The backgrounds of the coalition's leadership are one sign of its pro-drilling bent. At least three of four chair-level members have links to the oil industry. ETP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The fourth co-chair, Eddie Tullis, a former chairman of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Alabama, is involved in casino gaming, a major industry on reservations. Clahchischilliage and Tullis did not respond to requests for comment. As U.S. oil and gas drilling boomed over the past decade, tribes struggled to capitalize. A 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office found that poor management by the Bureau of Indian Affairs hindered energy development and resulted in lost revenue for tribes. Over the next decade, some 2.5 million acres of land were removed from tribal control, and 12,000 Native Americans lost their tribal affiliation. Mullin said the finalized proposal could result in Congressional legislation as early as next year. Washburn said he doubted such a bill could pass, but Gabe Galanda, a Seattle-based lawyer specializing in Indian law, said it could be possible with Republican control of the White House and the U.S. House and Senate. Legal challenges to such a law could also face less favorable treatment from a U.S. Supreme Court with a conservative majority, he said. Trump will soon have the chance to nominate a Supreme Court justice to replace Antonin Scalia, a conservative member who died earlier this year. Additional reporting by Richard Valdmanis.

A 21-page brief argues that the disturbance, which occurred in October, was not intentional. Julie Fedorchak, the chair of the commission, had accused Dakota Access of violating two provisions of its construction order. The firm adjusted the pipeline route, but did not file any certifications with the state, and it resumed construction on the adjusted route without securing approval, she said. But the deals are on hold now that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has denied an easement for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River at Lake Oahe. The agency now plans to prepare an environmental impact statement and identify potential new routes, a process that could take several months. According to Fedorchak, the artifacts that were disturbed in October were cairns. Those are stone formations or stone features that tribes use to mark important places, including burial grounds and sacred sites. In early September, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe notified a federal judge of similar stone features at another construction site . But a request for an injunction to protect the area was denied and the land was bulldozed by Dakota Access over the Labor Day holiday weekend.

Read analysis. A federal judge declared the DAPL permits to be illegal, and ordered the Corps to take a fresh look at the risks of an oil spill and the impacts to the Tribe and its Treaty rights. That is not what the Army Corps did. The Tribe has worked in good faith every step of the way to develop technical and cultural information to help the Corps fully understand the consequences of permitting this pipeline. They took our hard work and threw it in the trash. The Tribe will be reviewing this decision closely, and determine how best to proceed in close consultation with our membership, staff, and advisors. Previous Updates: Dec. 4, 2017 Court Opinion on Conditions Today, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, citing the recent Keystone oil spill in South Dakota, imposed several interim measures over the ongoing operation of the Dakota Access pipeline. The Court ordered three different measures, all of which were requested by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. First, the Court ordered the Corps and DAPL to work with the Tribes to complete oil spill response plans at Lake Oahe. Up to now, the Tribe has been kept in the dark about spill response planning and was not involved in the process of developing plans to address spills at Lake Oahe. The Tribe has to be involved in the selection of an auditor. Finally, DAPL must file regular reports on any incidents or repairs on the pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the Corps in July 2016, arguing that the pipeline destroyed sacred sites and threatens the water quality of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation that sits downstream of the site where the pipeline crosses the Missouri River in North Dakota. From the very beginning of our lawsuit, what we have wanted is for the threat this pipeline poses to the people of Standing Rock Indian reservation to be acknowledged. In a 28-page opinion, the court weighed two factors to determine whether or not the pipeline should be shut down. The court answered that question in the affirmative. Second, it assessed the disruptive consequences if the pipeline were shut down. However, the court found that the first factor was sufficient to rule against shutting down the pipeline. In its legal briefs, the Tribe had asked that if the pipeline were not shut down, then the court should impose additional measures to reduce the risk of oil spills to protect the Tribe. Because the district court case remains live, and the remand process is underway, this is not an appealable decision at this time. The Tribe intends to focus on the remand process and has a technical team of experts assisting it in providing input. The Corps has invited the Tribe to provide input into the remand, and that process is currently underway. The Corps has stated that process should be complete by April of next year. When Energy Transfer Partners proposed a new 1,200-mile oil pipeline from the Bakken oil fields to the Midwest, it chose a route crossing the Missouri River just yards upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Within days of his inauguration, however, Donald Trump ordered the permits granted. The Tribe filed a lawsuit to challenge this decision, but construction was completed while the case was proceeding. In June, just weeks after pipeline operations had begun, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled for the Tribe that the Army Corps had not complied with environmental review laws before issuing permits for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River. The court ordered separate briefing to assess whether the pipeline should be shut down while the remand process is going on. The decision on Oct. 11 addresses that question. Even Earlier Updates: Tribes Ask Court to Shut Down Pipeline The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, joined by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, filed an extensive legal brief on August 7, 2017, explaining why the pipeline must be shut down during the new environmental review process. The Tribes were supported by several amicus parties, including a group of Tribes and Tribal organizations, including the National Congress of American Indians, and a group of law professors and experts on the National Environmental Policy Act. Proposed amicus briefs were also filed by the North Dakota Petroleum Council and a coalition of industry groups. Additional resources: What the June 14 court ruling means and in-depth background on this litigation. In a 91-page decision, Judge James Boasberg ruled that the federal permits authorizing the pipeline to cross the Missouri River just upstream of the Standing Rock reservation, which were hastily issued by the Trump administration just days after the inauguration, violated the law in certain critical respects. Normally, when a federal agency violates the law by not looking at environmental risks well enough, the appropriate remedy is to invalidate the underlying permit. Without a permit, the pipeline cannot operate. Over the course of the summer, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe will be making our best arguments to the Court that the Judge should shut down the pipeline pending the completion of a lawful environmental review. Oil is expected to start flowing through the Dakota Access Pipeline today. The Judge still has the power to halt the pipeline. On behalf of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Earthjustice filed a motion for summary judgment on Feb. 14 on the major legal claims in the lawsuit filed against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to prevent the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe near tribal lands. All of the briefs in this case have now been filed. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is deeply concerned about the construction of the major crude-oil pipeline that passes through its ancestral lands. Our lawsuit raises three critical claims, and asks the court to throw out the federal approvals. These environmental reviews have been prepared for decisions as mundane as off-leash dog areas and allowing jet skis in parks. No one disputes that the Tribe has important Treaty rights that guarantee the integrity of its reservation. This means that the federal government and its agencies cannot take any federal action that harms the Standing Rock reservation or the water in the Missouri River on which the people of Standing Rock depend. The Obama administration made a carefully considered decision that these Treaty rights needed to be respected in connection with an oil pipeline immediately upstream of the reservation. The Trump administration ignored that advice, and acted as if the Tribe does not exist. And finally, there are limits on the extent to which one administration can reverse the decisions of its predecessor. While federal agencies can change their minds about matters of policy, the courts will set aside reversals that are not fully justified and explained. Additional details on the key merits of this case. Read an account from Earthjustice attorney Jan Hasselman on seeking the preliminary injunction, the Court's ruling on the request, and the remarkable announcement issued by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Justice and Interior. See: Standing With Standing Rock. In the key documents section of this FAQ. From The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Setting The Record Straight. The Tribe participated fully in the NEPA process. The Tribe sought to protect its rights when no one else would. In December 2016, the Corps correctly found that those issues needed further consideration through an EIS process. On his second full day in office, the Trump administration overruled the Corps and ordered the permits to be granted. See full document. Timeline of Events: July 27, 2016 The Tribe files a lawsuit in federal district court in Washington, D.C., where it was assigned to U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg. August 4, 2016 The Tribe asks the Court for a preliminary injunction since the pipeline is already under construction and would be finished before the case could be formally decided. August 24, 2016 Judge Boasberg holds a hearing on the motion in Washington, D.C. Over 500 people participated in an action outside the federal courthouse in support of the Tribe. The Judge indicated that he would rule in roughly two weeks. On Sept. 4, the Tribe files an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order to block the construction until a decision is reached on the injunction motion. Sept. 6, 2016 Judge Boasberg holds a hearing on the emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. The Judge issues a temporary restraining order for the pipeline corridor nearest the Missouri River but declines to halt construction on the portion of the pipeline route that had recently been identified as sacred tribal burial ground. Oct. 5, 2016 Oral arguments on the emergency motion for injunction are held at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A ruling was not issued, keeping the temporary halt to construction in place until the Court issues a decision. Both the appeal and the district court litigation will proceed, but the injunction covering work in the pipeline corridor has ceased. In the interim, the Army will not authorize constructing the Dakota Access Pipeline on Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe. Oct. 20, 2016 The Army Corps conducts a site visit to the area bulldozed over Labor Day to determine whether Dakota Access violated federal law by knowingly damaging a tribal sacred site. Under federal law, if Dakota Access is found to have knowingly damaged a historic or cultural resource with the intent of sidestepping the National Historic Preservation Act, the Corps cannot issue the easement. No determination has been finalized.

The pipeline rupture spilled about 176,000 gallons of oil, about 130,000 gallons of which flowed into Ash Coulee Creek. It appears no oil got into the Little Missouri, and no drinking water sources were threatened, according to Bill Suess, an environmental scientist with the North Dakota Health Department. The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over. The spill was in a remote area of the southwest part of the state, far from any major population centers. It fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. The most recent figures available are that about 37,000 gallons of oil had been recovered as of Sunday. A landowner initially discovered the spill about 16 miles northwest of the town of Belfield on Dec. 5. The pipeline was shut down immediately after the leak was discovered. Owen said sloughing of a hillside might have ruptured the pipe, but a definitive cause is still being investigated. True Cos. has a history of oil field-related spills in North Dakota and Montana, including a January 2015 pipeline break into the Yellowstone River. There have been much larger spills in North Dakota. For example, in September 2013, a Tesoro Corp. pipeline break spilled more than 840,000 gallons of oil into a wheat field near the northwestern town of Tioga. The 6-inch steel Belle Fourche Pipeline is mostly underground but was built above ground where it crosses Ash Coulee Creek. It was built in the 1980s. The Dakota Access pipeline is much larger at 30-inches to be buried 90-115 feet below Lake Oahe. Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners says the line will have modern leak detection equipment, and that workers monitoring the pipeline remotely in Texas could close valves within three minutes if a breach was detected. The route skirts the northern edge of the Standing Rock Reservation, which straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border. The Standing Rock tribe argues that putting the pipeline under the lake imperils drinking water for more than 8,000 tribal members and millions downstream. ETP and other pipeline advocates maintain that transporting oil through pipelines is safer than shipping it by truck or train. The Fight With the West Is Isolating Russia.

Native American tribes, led by the Standing Rock Sioux, have been protesting the pipeline project. They fear it would pollute the Missouri River and harm sacred cultural lands and tribal burial grounds. The letter from the district commander of the Army Corps, Col. John W. Henderson, said the emergency services and facilities needed to protect demonstrators camped north of the Cannonball River during the harsh North Dakota winters could not be provided. He said anyone found on the land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing. The project has spurred months of clashes between the police and demonstrators. The most serious injury happened early Monday. An explosion during a protest badly damaged the left arm and hand of woman who grew up in the Bronx, Sophia Wilansky, 21. Her father, Wayne Wilansky, said that someone from the police lines had thrown a device he described as a grenade; the police suggested that fellow demonstrators had caused the explosion, and said officers did not use concussion or flash grenades at any time. On Monday, the police confronted hundreds of protesters. Nearly 300 people were treated for injuries resulting from the use of police force, according to the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. The pipeline project was delayed in September when the Obama administration temporarily blocked it from crossing under the Missouri River. President Obama called on both sides to show restraint and revealed that the Army Corps of Engineers was considering an alternative route for the project.

A woman prays in front of the North Dakota State Capitol building. In December, the US Army Corps of Engineers rejected the permit that the project needed for its completion. But on Tuesday, Trump signed a series of directives aimed at speeding up the pipeline's approval process. Those reviews are seen by many government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as environmentalists, as cornerstones to ensuring the environment is taken into account when new construction projects are ordered. The project is a proposed 1,172-mile pipe that would shuttle half a million barrels of North Dakota-produced oil to refining markets in Illinois. Proponents of the pipeline say it would lessen dependence on foreign oil while creating jobs and growing domestic industry. As proposed, the pipeline would pass through North Dakota's Lake Oahe, a burial site sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux and a major source of drinking water for the community. But as I reported in December, it may have been too early to celebrate. Here's why environmentalists and people who live and work near the proposed pipeline are so concerned. Contaminated water is a massive health problem Should the Dakota Access pipeline leak or burst, the effects could be devastating. And leak pipelines do. An average of 121 accidents happened in both 2013 and 2014. Story Continues In addition, people who had used contaminated water for bathing or laundry appeared to experience more skin problems, ranging from mild rashes to severe and lasting eczema and malignant skin cancers. Passed in 1970, NEPA basically ensures that the government considers the potential environmental effects of any federal project, like a new highway or airport, before building it. The Standing Rock Sioux say that the Dakota Access pipeline's review process was not done properly. In a lawsuit it filed in July against the Army Corps of Engineers, the tribe said the permit process was rushed and undertaken largely without its input. If the pipeline were to leak or burst, it would send oil deep into the Missouri River, the Standing Rock Sioux's primary source of water, which the tribe relies on for everything from bathing to drinking. For that reason, the tribe says the Army Corps of Engineers could violate not just one, but two laws: NEPA and the Clean Water Act. Trump also owned stock in Energy Transfer Partners, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission, The New York Times reported on Tuesday. The Times added that a Trump spokesperson said last month that Trump had sold all of his stock during the summer, yet Trump has failed to provide any documentation proving the sale. Signs left by protesters demonstrating against the Energy Transfer Partners Dakota Access oil pipeline sit at the gate of a construction access road where construction has been stopped for several weeks due to the protests near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S. September 6, 2016. But as Bill McKibben wrote in The New Yorker, officials rerouted it when people there raised concerns that it could jeopardize the community's water supply.

The construction gets back on track just as protests spread nationwide from the North Dakota homelands of the Standing Rock Sioux and crystalize a new phase in the ongoing quest for indigenous rights. The pipeline fight remains combustible. In early 2016, most Americans, including the news media, were largely unaware of what was unfolding in North Dakota, transfixed as they were by the presidential campaign. The images of animals attacking peaceful protestors called to mind those of police with dogs going after African American civil rights protestors in the South only a few decades ago. Instead of deterring new pipeline opponents from joining them, the violence perpetrated on the protestors continued and brought new protestors streaming into North Dakota. He joined a group that took supplies to Standing Rock last October. Another tribe, the Cheyenne River Sioux filed a new case challenging the pipeline that summarizes the worries about the possible drinking water contamination from leaks. Not everyone wants to wait for the courts, however. Many of the people who remain at the site are moving only to safer grounds from areas that will that see seasonal spring flooding after the snow melts. This has never been about presidents of the United States or agencies. Trump is likely motivated more by his commitment to boost domestic oil and gas production than by animus against Native Americans. It could also portend the opening of another, darker chapter of conflict between Native Americans and the federal government.

Both were released from custody at the Hennepin County Jail Monday. A 27-year-old woman has also been accused of burglary and obstructing legal process. Police haven't released details of her role in the incident.

The two protesters were suspended in the air above Section 120 and one protester in a No. 4 Brett Favre Vikings jersey -- Mayo -- shimmied down the banner. Six rows of fans were cleared below the protesters. Rescue workers used rappelling gear to navigate the truss above the stadium, where they eventually convinced the protesters to climb down a ladder connected to the truss. The protestors told police negotiators they wanted the media present as they descended from the rafters. They were not made available to reporters.

They are being trapped and attacked. A spokesman for the sheriffs department said that law enforcement was spraying water because protesters were lighting fires on and around the bridge. One person was arrested, according to the sheriffs department . One hundred sixty-seven people were injured and seven were taken to the hospital, according to Jade Begay, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network. The tribe fears that the pipeline, which is planned to cross under the river less than a mile from the Standing Rock Reservation, will threaten their water source and argue that construction has already disturbed sacred burial grounds. Pipeline construction is almost completed in North Dakota, but the company building it, Energy Transfer Partners, still lacks a final permit to drill under the river. On Tuesday, 15 November, the company went to court seeking to have a judge force the government to allow it to begin drilling immediately. The trucks have been in place for several weeks, and law enforcement has erected a barricade behind them, forcing all traffic to take an approximately 20-mile detour. Begay said that activists did light two bonfires to keep people warm and make soup and tea. Other fires were sparked by law enforcement weapons, she added. The activists successfully moved one of the trucks before law enforcement responded with tear gas, water cannons, and other weapons, Begay said.

After the Obama administration denied the company a key permit to finish construction, Native American activists warned that the win was only temporary and that Trump, an investor in the pipeline corporation, would seek to quickly advance the project next year. Some indigenous advocates and environmental groups have focused their efforts to hurt the pipeline company's profits on an approaching 1 January deadline that the operator, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), cited in court records. Protesters march along the pipeline route during a protest against the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in St. Anthony, North Dakota, U.S. November 11, 2016. Shippers contacted by the Guardian either did not respond to inquiries or declined to comment on the terms of their contracts with Energy Transfer. Regardless of the significance of the January date, opponents of the project argued that the continuing suspension of the project is already having a big impact on the ETP's bottom line. Earlier this month, the Swedish bank Nordea said it would not back the pipeline if the corporation violated the demands of the Standing Rock tribe. Tim Donaghy, senior research specialist with Greenpeace, which has petitioned banks to abandon DAPL, noted that reports of extreme police violence against Native Americans have further fueled the divestment efforts. Police use a water cannon on protesters during a protest against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, U.S. November 20, 2016. Global oil prices began to collapse in 2014 after shippers committed to DAPL, and production in the Bakken Shale oil field has fallen, which has created major hardships for drillers, according to the recent Ieefa report. That means the existing pipeline infrastructure may be adequate to handle regional oil production, and that if the contract deadline does expire, shippers could be eager to pull out or renegotiate favorable terms. Dallas Goldtooth, organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, who has been a leader on the ground at Standing Rock, said a permanent cancellation of the project could have long-term implications for the industry. The company should not be trusted, she said, noting that the construction site was being monitored to ensure that DAPL workers do not start drilling under the Missouri river, which provides the tribe's water supply.

Many activists traveled to Washington, D.C., from Standing Rock, where they had been camping out for months in opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline. Many are statutory and the legislation that created them cannot be swept aside by an executive order. Trump said that both pipeline projects would be subject to renegotiation. In an Oval Office signing before reporters, the president hinted at a possible new wrinkle. He said he would want any new projects to make use of American steel, though that requirement is not mentioned in his executive order. The orders will likely have an immediate impact in North Dakota, where the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners wants to complete the final 1,100-foot piece of the 1,172-mile pipeline route that runs under Lake Oahe. The pipeline would carry oil from the booming shale oil reserves in North Dakota to refineries and pipeline networks in Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other Native American groups have been protesting the project, which they say would imperil their water supplies and disturb sacred burial and archaeological sites. The Army Corp of Engineers called a halt to the project in December to consider alternative routes. The tribe is expected to return to court in a bid to block the project. The camp is in a flood plain, and heavy snow could pose dangers when it starts melting. TransCanada, the Calgary-based project owner, has said it would be interested in reviving the pipeline. Originally, TransCanada had planned to get about 65 percent of the steel pipe from U.S. manufacturers but other supplies from Canada. We build the pipelines, we want to build the pipe. President Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. During the daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer discussed the timeline for the Keystone XL pipeline project. (Reuters) As news of the move surfaced Tuesday morning, oil industry officials hailed it as overdue. Environmentalists, by contrast, vowed to continue to fight the two pipelines. Americans have tended to favor the Keystone XL project even as Obama rejected it. Earlier Post-ABC surveys found that Americans widely expected the project to create a significant amount of jobs, but that they were divided on whether it would pose a significant environmental risk.

He announced that the United States Army Corps of Engineers had rejected the permits needed to finish the Dakota Access pipeline project, which would have put an oil pipeline through treaty lands promised to the Sioux in the 1800s. The order effectively halts all construction going forward until further environmental reviews for alternative routes are conducted. The indigenous people of the camp broke out into tribal victory dances. Welden Johnson, a member of the Colorado River Indian tribes, had traveled to Standing Rock to show solidarity with the Lakota Sioux people. At night, fireworks burst overhead, lighting teepees as the crowd cheered. The victory at Standing Rock serves as a bright moment in what has been a dark year for civil rights movements and people of color across the world. Isolationist movements like Brexit, the election of Donald Trump and the resurgence of white nationalism in the U.S. have put the sovereignty and safety of refugees and indigenous people around the world in jeopardy. The Standing Rock resistance, for many progressives, represents a tangible victory at a time when protest has seemed ineffective. Some of the indigenous here are skeptical, after centuries of abuse, that the federal government has suddenly come to their rescue. But even as the future of the Standing Rock struggle remains uncertain, the Lakota people have demonstrated, through resilience and unity, the way forward for resistance movements as racist, xenophobic and authoritarian power flexes its might. Over the months, hundreds of people blistered their palms constructing longhouses and yurts in time for the winter chill. They washed dishes in murky water, chopped wood and woke throughout the night to stoke wood stoves in meeting halls so that dozens of people could sleep without freezing. The resistance at Standing Rock represents a coalition of unexpected allies. It's the first time in over a hundred years that the seven Sioux tribes have gathered together, and although the Sioux and the Crow Nation have had a centuries-old rivalry based on land wars, the Crow visited in November with gifts of buffalo meat. It hasn't been just the indigenous in this fight. In the past week week, Oceti Sakowin camp expanded rapidly to accommodate a flood of non-native visitors and volunteers, growing by hundreds each day. On Saturday, 700 veterans arrived to take part in the protest and stand as human shields between water protectors and police, who have reportedly used tear gas, concussion grenades and water cannons to suppress the water protectors at the front lines. The veterans set up ground over the weekend, building their own accommodations on the north side of camp and registering to serve at the medical tent. Over 2,000 veterans are still anticipated to arrive before Monday, the deadline for an evacuation notice put out by the governor of North Dakota. The fight has just begun But even now that victory has been declared, that tide could still turn. Already, visitors who came to stand in solidarity are packing it in to head home. But not everyone at Standing Rock is convinced that this is the end of the pipeline's path through treaty land. The Dakota Access pipeline company could continue to drill, choosing to incur fines by ignoring the Army Corp of Engineers. Some fear Trump, who at one point had a stake in the company building the pipeline, will reverse the decision when he takes office in January. It was never true, but the rumors spread.

Brian Walsh, an environmental scientist with the South Dakota department of environment and natural resources, said the spill was relatively minor and was caused by a mechanical failure at a surge pump. Standing Rock Sioux tribe chairman Dave Archambault II said the spill is another sign that the courts should intervene. The company and the state made no announcements about the spill after it occurred. Walsh said the department only releases public notices of spills when there is an imminent threat to a waterway or public health. A spokeswoman told the Associated Press that the corporation maintains that the pipeline is safe and that the leak was contained in the proper manner. The Associated Press also reported that no other Dakota Access spills have been documented in any other states.

Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger This summer, Tim Mentz Sr. took to YouTube to tell the world about the destruction of his cultural heritage. A former tribal historic preservation officer of the Standing Rock Sioux, Mentz wore a baseball cap, rimless glasses and two thin braids of graying hair. He was upset and spoke rapidly about the area behind him, an expanse of the Great Plains cut by a new 150-foot-wide road. Two days before, Mentz had testified to the D.C. District Court to report the area that lay in the path of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) corridor holds 82 cultural features and 27 graves. By the next day, DAPL construction workers graded the area. Behind where Mentz stood in the video was a place known as the Strong Heart Society Staff, where a sacred rattle or staff was placed within stone rings. Here members of the elite warrior society would come to make pledges. As an anthropologist who has worked with Native Americans for more than a decade to document their sacred places in the paths of new power plants, power lines, water pipelines and more, the battle in North Dakota is all too familiar. Consultation with tribes too often breaks down because federal agencies are unwilling to consider how Native Americans view their own heritage. Irreplaceable heritage If completed, the Dakota Access Pipeline would run from North Dakota to Illinois for nearly 1,200 miles, carrying up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day. DAPL would meander across the landscape, through farms, around cities, buried underground and across more than 200 waterways. The passage of the pipeline over and under waterways requires permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This federal authorization in turns requires compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The stand-off between Native Americans in North Dakota and an oil pipeline project developer and police forces has inspired protests across the country. The NHPA does not guarantee preservation. For many years, Native Americans would have had little input on a project such as DAPL. But in 1992, Congress amended the NHPA to formally include traditional cultural properties. The amendments directed federal agencies, in carrying out their responsibilities under the NHPA, to consult with Indian tribes that attach religious and cultural significance to these sacred places. Beyond consultation In North Dakota, federal and state review and compliance measures for DAPL were combined. Engineers rerouted DAPL to avoid all but nine sites. Archaeologists serve an important role in documenting historic properties. But they tend to view the world through the lens of science and history. They search out buried villages, pottery shards, bones, broken stone tools. Traditional cultural properties in the U.S. can often be archaeological sites, artifacts that ancestors once touched and places that mark ancestral homes. But just as often they can be a mountain where spirits dwell or a spring where water is gathered for ceremonies. They can be a traditional area for collecting plants or animals that sustain and heal communities. They can be origin places where ancestors emerged onto the earth or named places recalled in ancient tongues. Zuni elders Octavius Seowtewa and John Bowannie, and archaeologist Sarah Herr, look at a shrine archaeologists misidentified. Chip Colwell, Author provided This is why documenting traditional cultural properties requires not the work of archaeologists but Native Americans as well. On one project I conducted with the Hopi tribe to detail cultural resources along a 470-mile power line, we needed weeks of research to identify more than 200 plant species that the tribe uses in its traditional religious and healing practices. When it comes to traditional practices, Native Americans see what archaeologists overlook. Tribal surveys For DAPL, a tribal survey was not undertaken. In North Dakota the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers tried to engage in consultation dozens of times, but the Standing Rock Sioux largely refused because the federal agency only wanted to consult on a narrow corridor at water crossings instead of the entire pipeline. Once, though, consultation did occur at Lake Oahe on March 8, 2016. Current designs call for the pipeline to go under this now controversial waterway, which the Sioux want protected. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials admitted they were unaware of some of these sites. Chip Colwell, Author provided On Sept. 21 and then again on Oct. 20, according to an email I received from the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Office, delegations that included law enforcement, Standing Rock Sioux officials and tribal and state archaeologists went to the areas that Mentz suggested contained 82 sites and 27 burials. Two bones were recovered, but analysis showed them to be from a horse, cow, or bison. It would seem that the main sites Mentz agonized over had escaped physical destruction. However, tribal input would be needed to determine if the sites, so close to the corridor, could still suffer from indirect and cumulative impacts. Not too late Because consultation broke down and so little of the pipeline has received tribal survey, we must wonder how much has been missed. Nearly 90 percent of the pipeline has already been completed. This is an unfortunate but common occurrence. Last month I went out with traditional leaders of the Zuni tribe in New Mexico to identify traditional cultural properties under the NHPA in the path of a massive network of water pipelines. When we arrived, we found dozens of construction workers busily laying the new pipe. An archaeological survey was already completed; the construction had begun with the consent of the federal agency.

The Oglala Sioux Tribe has filed a lawsuit calling for the Army Corps of Engineers to stop construction of the pipeline until an environmental impact statement is completed. Tom Stromme, Bismarck Tribune Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Fearing contamination of its drinking water, the Oglala Sioux Tribe has entered the legal fray against the Dakota Access pipeline. Attorneys working for the tribe filed a lawsuit Monday in U.S District Court in Washington calling for the Army Corps of Engineers to halt construction of the controversial oil pipeline until an environmental impact statement is completed. The Oglala Sioux filed their complaint the same day that a federal judge in Washington, D.C., denied a similar request from the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. Situated on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in southwest South Dakota, the Oglala Sioux Tribe draws its drinking water from the Missouri River, as do more than 200,000 Native and non-Native American people in the state. The tribe gets its water from the Mni Wiconi Rural Water Supply System, which draws water from the Missouri River. Owned and operated by the tribe, the Mni Wiconi rural water system is one of the largest in North America, measuring more than 4,000 miles and serving about 55,000 people in western South Dakota, according to the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. Starting from an intake at the Oahe Reservoir near Fort Pierre, the system stretches 150 miles to Pine Ridge, where it provides drinking water for an estimated 21,500 tribal members. The Mni Wiconi water system also supplies water to the Rosebud Sioux and Lower Brule Indian reservations, as well as non-Native communities including Fort Pierre, Murdo, Kadoka, Wall, Philip and Midland. In 2015, the system supplied those communities with a total of about 78.4 million gallons of water. On Dec. 4, under the Obama administration, the Army Corps ordered a complete environmental impact statement on the pipeline project. But when the Trump administration took over, the Corps reversed its decision and granted the final easement to allow the completion of pipeline construction near the site of a massive protest movement outside the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation in North Dakota. Bad precedent. Also in Washington, the Standing Rock Sioux asked the U.S. District Court to overturn permits issued for the pipeline. Tribal lawyers filed for a summary judgment on the permits issued by the Corps. The tribe said it is seeking the judgment in hopes of getting a decision before the pipeline starts operating.

The tribe, which has fought to stop the pipeline since last year, won a major victory last month when the government denied Energy Transfer Partners LP the right to run the pipeline under Lake Oahe, a water source upstream from the reservation. A weathered, inverted America flag catches the wind in a campsite in the Dakota Access Pipeline protest camp near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. The tribe had recently called for protesters to leave after the Army Corps of Engineers agreed to an environmental review last month, saying the battle had moved beyond the camp and into the courts or back rooms for negotiations with the government. The tribe also warned that the camp itself might contaminate the river if hit by heavy flooding in March, when waters are expected to rise. On Tuesday, Standing Rock leaders said they would meet in the coming days to plan next steps. Some said they feared fresh violence after past clashes between protesters and law enforcement officers. Since the exit of the Standing Rock Sioux, the camp has been less organized, with no regular sunrise prayers and communal kitchens that now only serve food sporadically.

Kevin Cramer The North Dakota Public Service Commission is defending its complaint against Dakota Access Pipeline in connection with the disturbance of a tribal site. The wealthy backers of the pipeline already admitted that construction crews dug up tribal artifacts and waited 10 days to notify the state. The commission has since responded to the firm's attempt to avoid accountability. A December 16 memo, first reported by the Associated Press, notes that Dakota Access has repeatedly told the public that it has fully complied with applicable laws. In November, Julie Fedorchak, the chair of the commission, accused Dakota Access of violating two provisions of its construction order. The firm adjusted the pipeline route, but did not file any certifications with the state, and resumed construction on the adjusted route without securing approval, she said. According to Fedorchak, the artifacts that were disturbed were cairns. Those are stone formations or stone features that tribes use to mark important places, including burial grounds and sacred sites. In early September, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe notified a federal judge of similar stone features at another construction site. But a request for an injunction to protect the area was denied and the land was bulldozed by Dakota Access over the Labor Day holiday weekend.

It said this was partly to protect the general public from violent confrontations between protesters and law enforcement that have occurred in the area. Those who stay could face prosecution for trespassing, the Corps said in a letter to tribal leaders on Friday. Organizers told a news conference on Saturday at the main protest site where about 5,000 people are camped that they had no intention of moving. There are smaller camps on land not subject to the planned restrictions, including an area south of the Cannonball River where the Corps said it was establishing a free-speech zone. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple, a Republican, on Saturday said he supported the decision and the federal government, which allowed the protesters to become entrenched, must lead in the camp's peaceful closure. Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault said he received notice on Friday about the decision in a letter from Colonel John Henderson, an Army Corps district commander. Archambault said the best thing the federal government could do for safety is deny the easement for the pipeline. Archambault said he did not see the letter as a forced eviction and the tribe would continue to exercise its First Amendment rights to free speech. The tribe is working on a location on reservation land should people choose to go there, he said. The companies say the pipeline would carry Bakken shale oil more cheaply and safely from North Dakota to Illinois en route to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries. The 1,172-mile (1,885-km) project is mostly complete except for the segment planned to run under Lake Oahe less than half a mile north of Standing Rock. The Obama administration in September postponed final approval of a permit required to allow tunneling beneath the lake, a move intended to give federal officials more time to consult with tribal leaders.

Distribute. Fallen Warriors Obituaries to fallen warriors. Journal. At around 7:00 AM, about 30 people holding signs and banners gathered on a dirt road leading to the construction site, blocking workers and work vehicles from driving down the road for about half an hour. The workers, all of whom were brought in from out of state, were attempting to bore hole drill under the Santa Fe River to create a path for the pipeline. Police arrived after a few minutes, ordered the protesters out of the road, and shoving demonstraters in the process. Despite the order, protesters continued down the road towards the work site. Around half of the protesters entered a piece of property adjacent to the work site and approached workers with signs and banners, then came back to the road where everyone gathered to block a large water truck from entering the site. The water is necessary for bore hole drilling, and preventing the water from entering the site meant stalling construction yet again. Police again approached, and one protester was pushed into a barbed wire fence by an officer, but the blockade held strong for an hour and a half, with a banner crossing the two-lane road. It is believed that other vehicles and equipment were also unable to access the site due to the blockade. During this hour-and-a-half-long standoff, some protesters moved to another side of the site and blockaded yet another work truck for about an hour. The blockades ended with no arrests. If completed, the 515-mile Sabal Trail pipeline, partly owned by Spectra Energy, would carry fracked gas through Alabama, Georgia, and Florida, threatening wildlife and water sources.

As the Standing Rock Sioux and allies battled the crippling cold, the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (USACE) handed the native community a victory by denying the permit for the final construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. The USACE said they will conduct an environmental impact assessment and consider possible alternative routes. The plans for forced removal and blockades were eventually abandoned as the camps swelled to an estimated 10 to 20,000 people during the weekend of December 3rd and 4th. Among the thousands of supporters were veterans who had traveled from around the country to stand in solidarity and defense of the water protectors. Although fireworks rang out above the camps following the Army Corps decision, there was also a sense of hesitation. Water protectors remained uncertain over whether the fight had really been won or if the decision was simply a ploy to delay an inevitable conclusion. It quickly became apparent that the fight was not over as word spread that the company behind the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, would continue with their plans to complete the project. ETP has also filed a lawsuit in an attempt to force the Army Corp of Engineers to allow construction. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg set a court hearing for February, a move that has water protectors concerned. By February, President-elect Trump will be in office and could potentially fast track approval for the final construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Trump has already shown he is friendly to the oil industry and until recently, was invested in Energy Transfer Partners. Perry quickly joined the boards of the oil companies only weeks after leaving office. With all these legal and political developments, it is easy to forget about the battle being waged on the ground and the water protectors who remain at the camps. Following the Army Corps decision to block the permit, Standing Rock Sioux tribal chairman Dave Archambault II asked supporters to go home. Archambault said the fight was shifting to a legal battle and asked supporters not to put their lives at risk by traveling to the camps under such harsh weather conditions. People have come from all over the world- from many nations- from many traditions. Prayers in hundreds of languages were spoken around that fire. Dances that are hundreds of years old, passed from generation to generation, were danced around that fire, & as the last coal of this fire goes out, the smoke goes into the air, & swirls, & the heat that it warmed us with together in these days is now cold & has gone back deep into the Earth. The Sacred Stone Spirit Camp made their own post to clarify that some people were choosing to stay behind and continue the fight. The elders were told in ceremony it was time to put out this specific fire because the prayers had been heard. We just want to make sure people are safe. As the fight against DAPL evolves, the water protectors have been given a harrowing reminder of what they are fighting against. On December 5, a pipeline leaked 176,000 thousands of crude oil only a couple hours away from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Interestingly enough, the Belle Fourche pipeline uses the same type of electronic safety equipment that is supposed to keep the DAPL from leaking. For the water protectors, the spill is just another in a long list of reasons why the Black Snake known as the Dakota Access Pipeline must not be completed.

Now, the Corps has reversed course. Robinson Meyer Feb 1, 2017 On January 2, 2017, protesters rally against the Dakota Access Pipeline in a march behind the 128th Rose Parade in Pasadena, California. Specifically, at the direction of the acting secretary of the army, the Corps will permit the pipeline to be built under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. It will not remove the last legal hurdle, however. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said Tuesday that it would sue to block the pipeline if the Corps follows through on their announcement. Some kind of environmental-impact review for the Dakota Access pipeline is required by the National Environmental Policy Act, a federal law passed under President Nixon. Energy Transfer Partners, the company building the pipeline, has not issued a statement. The apparent reversal continues the saga over the project, which has become a rallying point for Native civil rights and a deepening crisis for federal rule of law. He has never offered evidence he has divested himself of it. The Dakota Access pipeline is a proposed 1,100-mile conduit that will connect the oil fields of North Dakota to the ports and refineries of southern Illinois. But it also crosses Lake Oahe, a federal waterway and a major reservoir of the Missouri River. The Standing Rock Sioux reservation is west of Lake Oahe, and they depend on it as a water source. Since the spring, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has argued that neither Energy Transfer Partners nor the Army Corps of Engineers told the tribe about plans for the project, as the law requires. The Army Corps of Engineers used a national permit designed for wetland areas to approve the pipeline, meaning that the project never got a full environmental-impact review. The tribe and the Army Corps of Engineers tussled over whether this was legal throughout the summer. Three months later, in early December, the Army Corps of Engineers announced that it had made a mistake. The Dakota Access pipeline would get a two-year environmental-impact review after all. The army now appears to be fulfilling that command. The Army Corps appears to not yet have formally issued the easement allowing the construction. Instead, two different congressmen from the state said that the acting secretary for the army informed them that he will order the easement. Throughout the process, legal experts have stressed that if the president follows proper procedure, he has relatively little power to change the fate of the pipeline. After the Corps announced that the pipeline would get a full environmental review, they stressed this point. Now that seems to be exactly what has happened. Under President Obama, the Army Corps of Engineers decided it needed to give the pipeline an environmental-impact review; under President Trump, it immediately ruled the opposite. At some point, politics contravened legal responsibility in this case. Americans might want to know when that happened. We want to hear what you think about this article.

For months, members of the Sioux tribe and their supporters have camped out, fighting the pipeline they say could be hazardous and damage the water supply of their reservation nearby. Photo essay: 'Prayers have been answered' Tribal leaders worry the decision to change direction may not be permanent, especially with the incoming Trump administration, as well backers of the pipeline seeking to push the project ahead. Grassroots activists, who have turned the protest site into a mini-city, prepared to withstand freezing temperatures during what was expected to be an even lengthier standoff, were cautious about the scope and durability of their victory. The Army Corps of Engineers said it will not grant a permit to allow the proposed pipeline to cross under the lake. Officials said after discussion with the tribe and Dakota Access it became clear that more work had to be done on the project. The decision comes three weeks after her office announced it was delaying the decision after protests from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters. Darcy said the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an environmental impact statement with full public input and analysis, delivering both an immediate reprieve and political statement that could aid in future showdowns with President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration. As far as they're concerned, the White House's directive does not change past court decisions to green light the project. North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, a Republican, said last week after a meeting with the transition team that Trump supported completing the 1,172-mile long proposed pipeline, that would transport 470,000 barrels of oil a day across four states. A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday's decision. id)); This is big-government decision-making at its worst. I look forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us. Opponents ready for next fight The decision by the Corps of Engineers would be useful in a court challenge, according to Jan Hasselman, an Earthjustice staff attorney representing the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. The pipeline protests are at a critical point. This is how we got there. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who actively opposed the pipeline, praised the administration's decision. May Boeve, the executive director leading environmental action group 350.org, celebrated the decision but also sounded a warning against any future plans to reverse it. From threat of removal to celebration Earlier this week, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple ordered the protesters to leave the campsite by Monday, citing the harsh weather conditions as a reason why they needed to decamp. The US Army Corps of Engineers had warned that come Monday, activists who refused to leave the campsite could be arrested, then backtracked, saying the agency had no plans to forcibly remove those who stay. Instead of backing away, the protesters came out in full force and showed no signs of backing down, even inviting over 2,000 veterans to join their already robust presence.

Company Engaged in Deceit and Fraud in Acquiring Land Easements, Lawsuit Claims Some two dozen landowners in Morton County, North Dakota, have filed a lawsuit this month in U.S. District Court against Dakota Access. The Associated Press writes: Those suing say Dakota Access engaged in unfair tactics and fraud while negotiating to lay pipeline on private land, resulting in compensation that was as much as nine times lower than what other landowners got. Landowners also allege they were told if they didn't agree to the offered amount, they faced losing money or getting nothing either because their land would be condemned through eminent domain or the pipeline would be moved elsewhere. The company has until about the end of the month to file its response in court. Water Protectors at the protest campsite have noticed desperation and declining morale due to the new Republican president, according to Billings Gazette. Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome.

The Court did not determine whether pipeline operations should be shut off and has requested additional briefing on the subject and a status conference next week. The Court ruled against the Tribe on several other issues, finding that the reversal allowing the pipeline complied with the law in some respects. The pipeline would carry up to 570,000 barrels a day of crude oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to Illinois where it links with another pipeline that will transport the oil to terminals and refineries along the Gulf of Mexico.

As temperatures dipped to minus 20 and another storm threatened to shut down roads for as much as a week, the fragility of the camp became clear. Tepees rely on firewood to stay warm but forests are hundreds of miles away. Historically, plains Indians sought refuge in wooded lowlands along rivers with an ample supply of firewood and shelter from the wind. Many such lowlands, like those along the Missouri River, have been flooded by dams like the one that forms Lake Oahe.

Nov. 23, 2016 President-elect Donald J. Trump, however, has taken a different view of the project and said as recently as last week that he supported finishing the 1,170-mile pipeline, which crosses four states and is almost complete. Mr. Trump owns stock in the company building the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, but he has said that his support has nothing to do with his investment. There was no immediate response from Energy Transfer Partners, but its chief executive, Kelcy Warren, has said that the company was unwilling to reroute the pipeline, which is intended to transport as much as 550,000 barrels of oil a day from the oil fields of western North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois.

Trump, a former investor in Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based firm behind the pipeline, took executive action in his first week in office to expedite the project. On Wednesday, workers began drilling to complete the pipeline across the Missouri river. The JTTF revelation comes at a time when there have been increasing concerns at Standing Rock about law enforcement surveillance, police violence and the targeted arrests and prosecutions of activists. Since the summer, law enforcement officials have made roughly 700 arrests, in some cases leading to serious felony charges and possibly lengthy state prison sentences. Following recent indictments, at least six activists are now facing charges in federal court. Rumors about JTTF have caused further stress among the activists.

In November, a JTTF officer also showed up to the hospital room of Sophia Wilansky, a 21-year-old who was seriously injured during a standoff with law enforcement at Standing Rock, according to her father, Wayne Wilansky. The FBI took her clothes and still have not returned them, he said in an interview this week. Witnesses have said they believe she was hit by a police concussion grenade.

This is not the first time the JTTF has been tied to an investigation of civil rights protesters. Records from Minnesota suggested that the taskforce monitored a Black Lives Matter demonstration. For indigenous leaders who have vowed to continue fighting the pipeline on the ground, the FBI investigations and ongoing federal prosecutions have become increasingly worrisome.

The incident began at about 9 a.m. Sunday when the Marion County Sheriff's Office received a report of someone shooting at the pipeline and the equipment in the 12500 block of State Road 200 near Dunnellon. The driver did not stop, so a pursuit began. Soon, the Florida Highway Patrol joined the chase, which covered about 20 miles, DeCarlo said. A FHP trooper then performed a PIT maneuver that spun the truck before it crashed into an embankment on the east side of U.S. 41. The driver then got out of the truck and threatened officers with a weapon, DeCarlo said. Officers then shot and killed the man, said DeCarlo. The stretch of U.S. 41 where the shooting occurred was closed for several hours as law enforcement processed the scene. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement was investigating the incident, as is standard in police shootings. CCSO spokeswoman Heather Yates said, per policy and protocol, the officers involved in the shooting, who will not be identified, will be placed on administrative leave while undergoing evaluations. The FDLE will take over the investigation, she said. The pipeline is a project of Sabal Trail Transmission, a joint venture between Spectra Energy, NextEra Energy and Duke Energy. Spectra Energy spokeswoman Andrea Grover said in an email she is aware of the events that occurred in Marion and Citrus counties Sunday morning and no Sabal Trail workers were working at the time of the incident. Construction of the Sabal Trail pipeline has spurred mass protests in recent months by those who believe the pipeline and its contribution process are harmful to the environment and the Floridian aquifer. Earlier last week, two protesters were arrested in Marion County after crawling into the pipeline, marking a total of 26 Sabal Trail protest arrests in Florida. The pipeline is expected to bring about a billion cubic feet of natural gas to the state everyday and will branch into Citrus and Martin counties for existing power plants.

Eric Bergeson The Drive with Jack Sunday News State Dakota Access attorneys fighting tribes' religion argument Dakota Access attorneys fighting tribes' religion argument Saturday, April 01, 2017 7:22 a.m. CDT Energy Transfer Partners BISMARCK, N.D. - The developer of the Dakota Access pipeline is opposing an attempt by Sioux tribes to argue the project should be halted because it interferes with their religious practices. Energy Transfer Partners has asked a federal judge to reject an attempt by the tribes to amend their lawsuit to include the religion argument. The tribes sued last summer on other grounds, including that it threatened cultural sites and water supply. The tribes raised the religion argument in February, after the Trump administration cleared the way for final pipeline construction. ETP maintains the argument was made too late in the legal process. Federal Judge James Boasberg has already refused to allow the religion argument as a basis for stopping the pipeline from being finished. ETP says it's preparing to put the full line into service."}, {"URL": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-keystone-insight-idUSKBN17L2HK", "Timestamp": "20180918222033", "Sentences": "But Trump and the firm will have to get through Nebraska farmer Art Tanderup first, along with about 90 other landowners in the path of the pipeline. They are mostly farmers and ranchers, making a last stand against the pipeline - the fate of which now rests with an obscure state regulatory board, the Nebraska Public Service Commission. The group is fine-tuning an economic argument it hopes will resonate better in this politically conservative state than the environmental concerns that dominated the successful push to block Keystone under former President Barack Obama. They contend the pipeline will provide mainly temporary jobs that will vanish once construction ends, and limited tax revenues that will decline over time. They face a considerable challenge. Now Tanderup and others are gearing up for another round of battle - on a decidedly more local stage, but with potentially international impact on energy firms and consumers. The latest Keystone XL showdown underscores the increasingly well-organized and diverse resistance to pipelines nationwide, which now stretches well beyond the environmental movement. Another ETP pipeline in Louisiana has drawn protests from flood protection advocates and commercial fishermen. Faded signs around the farm still advertise the concert Willie Nelson and Neil Young played here in 2014 to raise money for the protests. Keystone offers a path to get heavy crude from the Canada oil sands to refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast equipped to handle it. TransCanada has route approval in all of the U.S. states the line will cross except Nebraska, where the company says it has been unable to negotiate easements with landowners on about 9 percent of the 300-mile crossing. The commission has scheduled a public hearing in May, along with a week of testimony by pipeline supporters and opponents in August. Members face a deadline set by state law to take a vote by November. TransCanada declined to comment in response to Reuters inquiries seeking a more precise number and description of the jobs, including the proportion of them that are temporary - for construction - versus permanent. Trump has been more specific, saying the project would create 28,000 U.S. jobs. The study indicates those jobs would be temporary, including some 16,100 at firms with contracts for goods and services during construction, and another 26,000, depending on how workers from the original jobs spend their wages. The firm will pay property taxes on the pumping stations along the route, but not the land. Art and Helen Tanderup talk about where the Keystone XL Pipeline will cut through the farm that has been in his wife, Helen's family for more than 100 years near Neligh, Nebraska, U.S. April 12, 2017. The alliance plans to target the commissioners and their electoral districts with town halls, letter-writing campaigns, and billboards. During the televised ceremony where Trump awarded the federal permit for the pipeline, he promised to weigh in on the Nebraska debate. Love, the White House spokeswoman, said she did not know if Trump had called Nebraska officials. The commission members - one Democrat and four Republicans - have ties to a wide range of conflicting interests in the debate, making it difficult to predict their decision. According to state filings, one of the commissioners, Democrat Crystal Rhoades, is a member of the Sierra Club - an environmental group opposing the pipeline. Another, Republican Rod Johnson, has a long history of campaign donations from oil and gas firms. The others are Republicans with ties to the farming and ranching sectors - including one member that raises cattle in an area near where the pipeline would cross. All five members declined requests for comment. PREPPING THE WITNESSES TransCanada has been trying since 2008 to build the 1,100-mile line - from Hardisty, Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska, where it would connect to a network feeding the Midwest and Gulf Coast refining regions. The firm had its federal permit application rejected in 2015 by the Obama administration. The Ogallala aquifer supplies large-scale crop irrigation and cattle-watering operations. Steskal dug his boot into the ground on his property, kicking up sand to demonstrate his biggest concern about the pipeline. TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said the company has a good environmental record with its existing Keystone pipeline network in Nebraska, which runs east of the proposed Keystone XL. The company, however, has reported at least two big pipeline spills in other states since 2011, including some 400 barrels of oil spilled in South Dakota last year. The Domina Law Group is helping the opposition by preparing the landowners, including the Tanderups and Steskals, for the August hearings, much as they would prepare witnesses for trial. Eminent domain allows for the government to expropriate private land in the public interest. But Jorde said he thinks TransCanada would struggle to meet that threshold in Nebraska.

Many activists traveled to Washington, D.C., from Standing Rock, where they had been camping out for months in opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline. Many are statutory and the legislation that created them cannot be swept aside by an executive order. Trump said that both pipeline projects would be subject to renegotiation. In an Oval Office signing before reporters, the president hinted at a possible new wrinkle. He said he would want any new projects to make use of American steel, though that requirement is not mentioned in his executive order. The orders will likely have an immediate impact in North Dakota, where the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners wants to complete the final 1,100-foot piece of the 1,172-mile pipeline route that runs under Lake Oahe. The pipeline would carry oil from the booming shale oil reserves in North Dakota to refineries and pipeline networks in Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other Native American groups have been protesting the project, which they say would imperil their water supplies and disturb sacred burial and archaeological sites. The Army Corp of Engineers called a halt to the project in December to consider alternative routes. The tribe is expected to return to court in a bid to block the project. The camp is in a flood plain, and heavy snow could pose dangers when it starts melting. TransCanada, the Calgary-based project owner, has said it would be interested in reviving the pipeline. Originally, TransCanada had planned to get about 65 percent of the steel pipe from U.S. manufacturers but other supplies from Canada. We build the pipelines, we want to build the pipe. President Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. During the daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer discussed the timeline for the Keystone XL pipeline project. (Reuters) As news of the move surfaced Tuesday morning, oil industry officials hailed it as overdue. Environmentalists, by contrast, vowed to continue to fight the two pipelines. Americans have tended to favor the Keystone XL project even as Obama rejected it. Earlier Post-ABC surveys found that Americans widely expected the project to create a significant amount of jobs, but that they were divided on whether it would pose a significant environmental risk.

'script', 'twitter-wjs'); Jun 15, 2017 The Standing Rock tribe and its supporters protested the construction of the pipeline near the tribe's land and under its water supply at a lake it considers sacred. Boasberg did not immediately rule on whether the flow of oil, which started through the pipeline on June 1, should be stopped. The pipeline's construction spurred months of protests and dozens of arrests over its location near the Standing Rock Reservation and particularly its crossing under the Missouri River at Lake Oahe, the tribe's water supply and an area it considers sacred. The tribe filed suit in July 2016 after the Corps concluded that a cursory environmental assessment of the pipeline project was sufficient and released a finding of no significant impact. The EPA said the Corps' assessment did not sufficiently consider the impacts on water resources, and the Corps later agreed to that more in-depth review. In one of his first acts as president, Donald Trump issued a presidential memorandum directing the Corps to expedite the pipeline's approval. But Boasberg said the Corps was looking only at the project's construction, not the potential for a spill. Furthermore, the treatment fell short of the Corps' duty to determine whether the project would have a disproportionate impact on minority and low-income populations, as the agency is required to do by law. Boasberg cited Council on Environmental Quality guidance on environmental justice, and case law under the National Environmental Policy Act. Losing the ability to do so could seriously and disproportionately harm those individuals relative to those in nearby nontribal communities. The pipeline's builder, Dakota Access LLC, part of Energy Transfer Partners, has already faced leaks along the pipeline. Trump has repeatedly cited the Dakota Access project start as proof of his administration's progress on lifting government restrictions on development. And I took none. Actually, none. But Boasberg's ruling makes clear that Trump's signature was not the final word on the Dakota Access pipeline.

We especially thank all of the other tribal nations and jurisdictions who stood in solidarity with us, and we stand ready to stand with you if and when your people are in need. With this decision we look forward to being able to return home and spend the winter with our families and loved ones, many of whom have sacrificed as well. We look forward to celebrating in wopila, in thanks, in the coming days. We hope that Kelcey Warren, Governor Dalrymple, and the incoming Trump administration respect this decision and understand the complex process that led us to this point. When it comes to infrastructure development in Indian Country and with respect to treaty lands, we must strive to work together to reach decisions that reflect the multifaceted considerations of tribes. Treaties are paramount law and must be respected, and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward. We are not opposed to energy independence, economic development, or national security concerns but we must ensure that these decisions are made with the considerations of our Indigenous peoples. To our local law enforcement, I hope that we can work together to heal our relationship as we all work to protect the lives and safety of our people. I recognize the extreme stress that the situation caused and look forward to a future that reflects more mutual understanding and respect. Again, we are deeply appreciative that the Obama Administration took the time and effort to genuinely consider the broad spectrum of tribal concerns. ar an sliabh December 7, 2016 No. They always just came in when it was basically over, did whatever, then left without even publicly briefing their findings. In this case, all the Department of Justice would have had to have done was to file an injunction based on the suspicion of the use of excessive force, which in the United States presents a federal civil rights violation and allows the Department of Justice to investigate. They did not do that, despite the obvious excessive force used, often by private persons acting as private security. They could have done it right after the first day of violence and prevented much harm, and alleviated much of the lost trust in government as a whole. This administration overall absolutely sucked at handling emergencies, natural or man-made. I was thinking it was a bit too active for Obama alright. Lord of Mirkwood December 8, 2016 I am just deathly worried about what Trump could do. These several days have been ones of jubilation for the good people over here. And it likely will.

But going ahead with the pipelines would mark a bitter defeat for Native American tribes and climate activists, who successfully blocked the projects earlier and vowed to fight the decisions through legal action. Trump campaigned on promises to increase domestic energy production. Even though Canada is already the biggest source of U.S. crude imports, boosting the flow from a close ally is seen in Washington as a way to improve U.S. energy security. TransCanada Corp said it would resubmit an application for a permit for Keystone XL after Trump signed an order saying the company could re-apply. The application will be reviewed by the U.S. State Department, which has 60 days to reach a decision. The orders look set to undo victories won by protesters in North Dakota against Energy Transfer Partners, which has nearly completed construction of the Dakota line. Despite the advanced phase of the project, the Obama administration in December denied the company a permit to tunnel under the Missouri River. At one point, nearly 10,000 people had flocked to federal land in North Dakota, including 4,000 veterans after protests turned violent at times. The main protest camp has dwindled to several hundred after the Standing Rock tribe asked activists to leave when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied the easement.

About 1 million barrels a day are currently produced in North Dakota. The more than 800,000 bpd Keystone XL pipeline would bring heavy crude from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The project was conceived nearly a decade ago, but since then the U.S. shale revolution has redefined oil flows, with domestic refiners finding themselves awash with supply and needing fewer imports. Environmental activists campaigned against the Keystone XL pipeline for more than seven years, eventually winning a victory when Obama rejected the project in 2015. TransCanada shares closed up 2.7 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Trump said on Tuesday in Washington that Keystone XL would create 28,000 jobs, but that figure is at odds with a 2014 U.S. State Department environmental study that said the project would create 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs. U.S. President Donald Trump holds up a signed executive order to advance construction of the Keystone XL pipeline at the White House in Washington January 24, 2017. The Army Corps earlier this month said it would begin an environmental assessment that could delay the project further. In Cannon Ball, North Dakota, protesters, many of whom have stayed at the camp for months, said they would continue fighting to protect the environment.

The incident occurred in October of 2016 when Fallis was protesting the building of the pipeline and law enforcement officers tackled her. As she fell to the ground and struggled as officers attempted to handcuff her, three gunshots allegedly went off and no one was injured. Officers removed a gun from her hand and arrested her.

Trump signs oil pipeline executive actions 03:02 Story highlights The decision to advance the pipelines would cast aside decisions by President Barack Obama's administration Trump during his campaign said he would streamline the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed executive actions to advance approval of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines. The decision to advance the pipelines cast aside efforts by President Barack Obama's administration to block construction of the two pipelines, while making good on one of Trump's campaign promises. Trump also issued executive actions declaring oil pipelines constructed in the US should be built with US materials, streamlining the regulatory process for pipeline construction and shortening the environmental review process. Trump during his campaign said he would streamline the approval of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was stalled for years in the Obama administration until Obama denied approval for the pipeline's construction altogether in November 2015. Read More And Trump said for the first time in December that he supported construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which stalled last year amid protests opposing its construction on Native American lands. The Obama administration denied the company a permit it needed to complete the pipeline late last year. Protesters of the pipeline projects quickly condemned the decisions Tuesday. Meanwhile, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a Democrat from North Dakota where the Dakota Access Pipeline is being built, welcomed the move, as did Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia. Trump's approval of both pipelines are early signs of how his administration will take a drastically different approach to energy and environmental issues. Beyond approving the pipelines, Trump has also vowed to slash environmental protection regulations and has nominated several skeptics of the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change to key Cabinet posts dealing with environmental issues. New wave of protests expected Environmental groups and their progressive allies have already begun to mobilize against Trump's directive. The documents signed by Trump are online now but were not provided directly to the tribes or their legal advocates. Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law organization that represents the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, told CNN they were prepared to act if Trump seeks to cut off the environmental review ordered by the Obama administration in December. Desiree Kane, who spent seven months at the Oceti Sakowin Camp as a media volunteer, told CNN she ready to answer the call.

Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) was granted formal permission to proceed with laying the pipeline under a North Dakota reservoir on Wednesday. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says the pipeline endangers its drinking water. Also on Thursday, the Cheyenne River Sioux filed a legal challenge, asking a federal judge to stall the project's completion while a lawsuit against the pipeline continues. The final section of the project is a crossing under Lake Oahe that would carry North Dakota oil through the pipeline to Illinois. Entry and exit holes had already been drilled into the pipeline and oil was stored inside in anticipation of the project's completion. The Army had begun further study of the river crossing after contamination fears raised by the Standing Rock tribe, but it notified Congress on Tuesday that it would stop the study and grant ETP permission to continue work. The decision came after Donald Trump formally backed the project last month in one of his first acts as US president. Thousands of predominantly Native American protesters have boycotted the pipeline's construction in the state of North Dakota. The 1,172 mile (1,886km), four-state project is almost finished except for the one-mile stretch under Lake Oahe, where demonstrators have set up protest encampments. The Obama administration announced in September that it would not allow the project to proceed, but Mr Trump overturned the decision.

The Army Corp of Engineers declined to grant Energy Transfer Partners, the corporation building the pipeline, the easement necessary to cross under Lake Oahe, and they called for environmental impact studies for alternative routes. This is big-government decision-making at its worst. I look forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us. The short-term victory against the pipeline effort was won by putting bodies on the line to occupy territory. The unintended consequence of celebration could be that those bodies become a scarce resource.

President-elect Donald Trump has said he supports finishing the project. Trump owns stock in the company building the pipeline but has said his support has nothing to do with his investment. What started as a small but fierce protest in a remote spot along the Missouri River months ago has evolved into an epic standoff involving hundreds of tribes, various celebrities, and activists. About 250 military veterans joined the protest Sunday. Environmental groups that protested alongside the tribes also rejoiced at the decision. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its allies in the environmental and activist movements had said they were doing just that: using Lake Oahe in North Dakota as a place to take a stand by setting up camps and obstructing roads to block the Dakota Access Pipeline and its owner, Energy Transfer Partners. The pipeline, if completed, would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal in Illinois. At 30 inches in diameter, it could transport an estimated 470,000 barrels of oil per day. Army officials said the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an environmental-impact statement with full public input and analysis, a process likely to take many months. Energy Transfer Partners had said it was unwilling to reroute the project. The federal government had ordered people to leave the main encampment, which is on Army Corps of Engineers land, by Monday. But demonstrators said they were prepared to stay, and authorities said they would not forcibly remove them. About 250 members of the group Veterans Stand for Standing Rock gathered earlier Sunday about a mile from the Oceti Sakowin, or Seven Council Fires, camp. Art Grayson, 29, of Cambridge, Mass., a Navy veteran and Harvard graduate student, told the Associated Press that he came to the camp as part of the veterans group because he thought the demonstrators could use his help. Grayson said he flew to the state, then met with other veterans and rode the final leg of the trip from Bismarck in a pickup truck. Jo-Ellen Darcy said she based her decision on a need to explore alternate routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing. Her office had announced on November 14, 2016 that it was delaying the decision on the easement to allow for discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation lies 0.5 miles south of the proposed crossing.

The state's Department of Environment and Natural Resources posted a report in its website's searchable database, but it didn't take any other steps to announce it to the public, despite an ongoing lawsuit by four Sioux tribes seeking to shut down the pipeline. Brian Walsh, an environmental scientist with the agency, said Wednesday that the state doesn't issue news releases on spills unless there is a threat to public health, a fishery or a drinking water system. He said there was no such threat with the Dakota Access leak, which happened nearly 100 miles east of the Missouri River's Lake Oahe reservoir, which is the tribes' water supply. The oil was contained on site by a plastic liner and containment walls and quickly cleaned up. Some oil-contaminated gravel will be disposed of at an area landfill, he said. Such incidents have happened with other pipelines in South Dakota, and the Dakota Access leak didn't come as a surprise, according to Walsh. The state is happy with the response of Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners and won't issue a fine, he said. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which was the initial plaintiff in the lawsuit, said the leak proves that the pipeline is a threat to its water and cultural sites. Nobody listened to us. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had planned additional study but scrapped the idea after President Donald Trump earlier this year pushed for completion of the pipeline that had been stalled by months of protests and lawsuits. Energy Transfer Partners maintains that the pipeline is safe. Spokeswoman Vicki Granado didn't immediately reply to phone and email requests for comment Wednesday. She said earlier that the pipeline is expected to be fully operational by June 1. No other spills have been reported along the pipeline in South Dakota, according to Walsh.

Credit: Andrew Lichtenstein Getty Images Advertisement The company building an oil pipeline that has been subject to sustained public protests said on Thursday it has resumed drilling beneath a North Dakota lake despite a last-ditch legal challenge from a Native American tribe leading the opposition. The project was put on hold under the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama, but new President Donald Trump, a Republican, helped put it back on track. The federal government this week cleared way for the project to resume, leading the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to file a court challenge on Thursday seeking a temporary restraining order to stop the 1,170-mile (1,885-km) pipeline. But Energy Transfer Partners said it has begun drilling under Lake Oahe, which is part of the Missouri River system. It expects the Dakota Access Pipeline to begin service in approximately 83 days, according to a company spokeswoman. Drilling under Lake Oahe will be completed in 60 days, and the company will require another 23 days to fill the pipeline to Patoka, Illinois, the spokeswoman said. Native American tribes and climate activists have vowed to fight the pipeline, fearing it will desecrate sacred sites and endanger a source of the country's largest drinking water reservoir. Public opposition has drawn thousands of people to the North Dakota plains, including high-profile political and celebrity supporters. Large protest camps popped up near the site, leading to several violent clashes and some 600 arrests. Supporters say the pipeline will be a safer mode of transportation for the oil than rail or trucks. Legal experts have said the tribe faces long odds in convincing any court to halt work on the pipeline. To obtain the temporary retraining order, the tribe must convince the judge there will be immediate harm suffered and prove that it has a strong overall case should its suit to halt the project completely go o trial.

For months, members of the Sioux tribe and their supporters have camped out, fighting the pipeline they say could be hazardous and damage the water supply of their reservation nearby. Photo essay: 'Prayers have been answered' Tribal leaders worry the decision to change direction may not be permanent, especially with the incoming Trump administration, as well backers of the pipeline seeking to push the project ahead. Grassroots activists, who have turned the protest site into a mini-city, prepared to withstand freezing temperatures during what was expected to be an even lengthier standoff, were cautious about the scope and durability of their victory. The Army Corps of Engineers said it will not grant a permit to allow the proposed pipeline to cross under the lake. Officials said after discussion with the tribe and Dakota Access it became clear that more work had to be done on the project. The decision comes three weeks after her office announced it was delaying the decision after protests from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters. Darcy said the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an environmental impact statement with full public input and analysis, delivering both an immediate reprieve and political statement that could aid in future showdowns with President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration. As far as they're concerned, the White House's directive does not change past court decisions to green light the project. North Dakota Sen.

May Boeve, the executive director leading environmental action group 350.org, celebrated the decision but also sounded a warning against any future plans to reverse it. From threat of removal to celebration Earlier this week, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple ordered the protesters to leave the campsite by Monday, citing the harsh weather conditions as a reason why they needed to decamp. The US Army Corps of Engineers had warned that come Monday, activists who refused to leave the campsite could be arrested, then backtracked, saying the agency had no plans to forcibly remove those who stay. Instead of backing away, the protesters came out in full force and showed no signs of backing down, even inviting over 2,000 veterans to join their already robust presence. Now with a victory for the Sioux tribe and their supporters, Standing Rock has become a protest symbol.

Mapes Seattle Times environment reporter As winter bears down on the Great Plains, a showdown also looms as thousands of veterans from around the country head to North Dakota vowing to be human shields between police and opponents trying to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which leases the lands for grazing, has also ordered the camp closed to all public access as of Dec. 5. Both explained that the threat of winter to public safety required their action. However, if campers stay, it is at their own risk, officials say. Winter temperatures can plunge into single digits during the day and below zero at night. Snow and cutting wind also arrived this week. About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects. And here's what we're reading related to the controversy. March 28: What the completed Dakota Access pipeline means for key players. Feb. 22: Preparing to leave, Standing Rock protesters ceremonially burn camp. Feb. 1: Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back. Emergency services to the camp will not be guaranteed per the evacuation order from Gov. Jack Dalrymple, unless approved on a case-by-case basis by the state Highway Patrol or the Morton County sheriff. Protesters vow to stay, and some 2,000 veterans are expected to arrive Sunday to join the fight by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its allies against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Developer Energy Transfer Partners of Houston has yet to obtain the easement it needs from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to cross under the river and finish the project. No construction or drilling work is under way on either side of the river, said Gary Sanders, sheriff for Emmons County, across the river from the protest camp. The only people on site now at the drilling pads are security, as Dakota Access waits for the easement to let it get drilling under the river, Sanders said. Opponents want to stop the project altogether. Some fear more violence, even death, as confrontations have escalated, most recently on Nov. 20 when police clashed with demonstrators, sending 26 people to the hospital. Some 300 people were treated for chemical contamination and hypothermia after being tear-gassed, hit with pepper spray and rubber bullets, and sprayed with fire hoses in freezing weather. Lonnquist said she fears worse to come. But being on that bridge and watching them purposely give us hypothermia not once but for six hours, I would grab a patient by the jacket and just crunch through a sheet of ice. Veterans Stand for Standing Rock will take its direction from tribal elders, said Marshal Hunter of Seattle, who coordinated veterans scheduled to leave from Seattle on Friday night in a convoy to North Dakota. A Navy veteran, Hunter, 53, works at Boeing as a computer-systems administrator, and lives in Edmonds. There is not an issue with peaceful protest. But Hunter said the show of force against demonstrators is way out of line. The leader of Washington State Veterans for Standing Rock is Jim Petersen, 60, a Navy veteran from Bellingham. He had been thinking about going to Standing Rock for some time, but the Nov. 20 clash, where police used water hoses, pushed him over the edge. So many veterans around the country have volunteered for this trip after the national call went out that another is already being organized for Dec. 10. The effort may become a rolling deployment as long as the Standing Rock Sioux want the help. Veterans participating are instructed to bring no weapons or ammunition and to remain nonviolent no matter what comes. In the past, it has called in reinforcements from Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming in addition to cities and counties throughout North Dakota to defend the pipeline project. Meanwhile more support from Washington tribes, fighting fossil-fuel projects of their own, continues to pour into the camp. A delegation of tribal leaders, drummers and singers from the Quinault Indian Nation, including tribal president Fawn Sharp, is to arrive Monday.

Anyone found on the land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing. Back in October, Woodley was arrested for criminal trespassing while protesting the construction of the project.

That's because a two-thirds share of the 370-acre parcel is owned by the federal government in trust for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which has not authorized people to live there, according to the notice. The notice says her beneficial interest does not release her from trespass liability. In a video posted online Thursday night, Allard countered that she believed the tribe had given authorization through a resolution passed in support of the camp. The council voted 11-0 in favor on June 8, 2016. The trespass order comes as the tribal council attempts to implement a January resolution to remove all Dakota Access Pipeline protesters from the Cannon Ball area. A meeting is scheduled for 6 this evening in Cannon Ball to reconsider the resolution. The BIA is giving people 10 days to show why they should not be found in trespass. In the alternative, people can avoid being found in trespass by leaving and removing personal property. The BIA has the right to seize all property, according to the notice. However, it is not yet clear what kind of enforcement the agency would take. In recent days, many in the Sacred Stone Camp have moved their yurts and dwellings to higher ground in the same lot. Some protesters living at the Oceti Sakowin camp also are moving to Sacred Stone, because the Oceti Sakowin camp is under an evacuation order by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers effective Wednesday. The corps also owns some of the Sacred Stone camp land because of acquisitions to manage the Lake Oahe reservoir. The trespass notice is effective for a year and can only be appealed if the BIA issues a finding of trespass against someone. Joye Braun, one of the first campers at the Sacred Stone camp, said Friday that she does not see the camp moving. A legal fight continues against the pipeline in federal district court.

He also met with local law enforcement, he said. Tauli-Corpuz previously called on the US to halt construction of the DAPL. The protests camps eventually attracted more than just Standing Rock Sioux Tribe members and those of other Native American tribes. In addition to tribal water supply concerns, the Missouri River is a source of drinking water to millions in the US. The DAPL also represents a continued dependance on fossil fuels, opponents say, which contributes significantly to global climate change. Thousands of people flocked to the area to support the DAPL opposition, leading to hundreds of arrests by at times aggressive, heavily-armed law enforcement. The Standing Rock Sioux has sued the Army Corps of Engineers and Energy Transfer Partners in federal court. The tribe has argued that the DAPL also threatens its sacred cultural and religious sites in the area. The defendants in the lawsuit dispute these claims. Via RT.

He'd never organized a protest before, Pomer said. Indigenous, labor, environmental and veterans' groups were involved in the effort, she added, pointing out that many participants have also been to the site of the Standing Rock protest in North Dakota. The pipeline projects have become among the country's most potent symbols of the clash between an oil and gas industry seeking to maintain the old order of energy production and the climate change movement pushing for a different direction. The Dakota Access project more recently became a national rallying point not only for environmental groups but for Native American tribes who said it threatened grounds they hold sacred. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has set up a camp to protest the pipeline, and the battle over it has become violent at times, with protesters clashing with police.

About 50 officers stood across from the protesters, and the crowd eventually dispersed. Morton County sheriff's office spokesman Rob Keller said officers near the campsites about 50 miles south of Mandan observed protesters attempting to build a wooden bridge over a body of water Thursday morning in an effort to reach Turtle Island, a hill where protesters claim burial sites are located.

So far there have been no mass encampments on the Nebraska prairie, no tense standoffs with the police, no highway blockades. But Jane Kleeb, a leader of the pipeline opposition, said the more muted tactics in Nebraska should not be mistaken for a lack of organization or tepid sentiments. Opponents here managed to delay Keystone XL for years during the Obama administration, challenging state permitting rules and drawing national attention to the pipeline.

As Nebraska emerges once again as a national pivot point for Keystone XL, the matter is already settled for most landowners along the route.

Ronald Weber, who owns land in the same county as Mr. Johnston, said he wished the route had avoided his property. Neither Mr. Weber nor Mr. Johnston said how much they were paid by TransCanada, which proposed Keystone XL, but both said the company had treated them fairly.

Mr. Van Housen, who grows corn and raises cattle, is adamantly opposed to Keystone XL, which would run beneath his fields. He says he might testify against the project at hearings this summer and, if it is approved, participate in protests.

He voted for Mr. Trump for president, knowing full well that his candidate supported the pipeline and that Hillary Clinton did not. Along the route, some holdout landowners voted for Mr. Trump, others for Mrs. Clinton, and still others for none of the above. Mr. Van Housen says he cannot reasonably expect to agree with the president on every issue.

Mr. Carlson said he feared that a leak in the pipeline would imperil the groundwater he uses to drink and irrigate his crops. Many politicians here believe the construction jobs and tax revenue make the project worthwhile. Doug Zimmerman lives along the route of a different oil pipeline built by the company, in use since 2010, and says he has had no problems. If TransCanada wanted to put in another pipeline on his land, he says he would be fine with that. But the route still traverses the aquifer, unnerving other landowners. The family ties run deep.

On Friday morning, thousands of indigenous nations and environmental activists descended on Washington, D.C. for what they called the Native Nations Rise march and rally. The 1.5 mile march from the US Army Corps of Engineers headquarters to the White House was the culmination of a week-long event that included cultural workshops and panels. Fighting against the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a controversial 1,172 mile-long pipeline that will eventually carry crude oil through North Dakota to Southern Illinois. Indigenous activists and their allies began fighting the pipeline in 2015, but their most serious set back took place immediately after the inauguration when President Trump signed executive orders to advance approval of the pipeline. This week, a federal judge signed an order refusing to halt the construction. Megan, who is 19-years-old and Navajo, traveled to Washington, D.C. from Arizona to help spread the word about the concerns of indigenous peoples. Rachel, 19-years-old, drove to the rally from Columbus, Ohio. It is unclear what will happen next and if the tribes have any more legal avenues to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline.

Similar to the Standing Rock Sioux, the Lunaape worry that a potential pipeline leak would pollute drinking water and sacred sites. The pipeline is capable of carrying 400,000 barrels of oil per day. The company, which announced the project three years ago, has not yet applied for the permit that would define their exact pipeline route. Members of the Lunaape want others in New Jersey to join their fight against the project. NBC New York reports that the Lunaape have displayed anti-Pilgrim pipeline signs alongside teepees that were initially erected to recognize the efforts of the Standing Rock Sioux, who are protesting the heavily contested Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. The tribe has been hosting teach-ins about the pipeline at their encampment. Dozens of people have already attended. Mahwah has issued a summons for their occupation, even though the town is officially against the pipeline and agrees that its route through Ramapo Valley Reservation is unacceptable. The coalition is calling on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to oppose the project. Cuomo and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation also denied a key permit to the Constitution Pipeline Project in April. Christie, however, is more of a wildcard. Although the Garden State is a solar power all-star, Christie is a fan of pipelines and a vocal supporter of the controversial Keystone XL.

The criminal gang was compared by police to an octopus with tentacles across Europe and its members were related by blood or marriage. The investigation began when three women were caught trying to break into a property in Munich in January 2016. It has led to arrests in Croatia and Spain as well as in Germany. Reinhold Bergmann, police commissioner for organised burglary, told reporters that the gang could have dozens of other tentacles operating in other countries such as Belgium, France and Italy. They claimed to be teenagers but police discovered they had forged identification papers and were linked to a wider gang originating in Croatia. Another two are on the run. Arrests have also been reported in Spain. Mr Bergmann said the group used young women to carry out the burglaries because they were discreet and less likely to face jail. They were even traded around different parts of the criminal family, which police say has some 500 members and is highly hierarchical. It was impossible to estimate the scale of losses sustained by burglary victims, police said, but it was likely to reach millions of euros. Police found alleged gang leaders living in luxury marble-floored villas in Zagreb. Croatian police have seized jewellery, other valuables and hundreds of thousands of euros in cash and are trying to trace their owners. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

Throughout the summer and fall, thousands of people from across the nation and around the world flocked to North Dakota to stand in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. This list includes well-known actors and actresses, such as Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, and Shailene Woodley. Until early December, tensions at the protest camps and nearby on the front lines only continued to increase. Mass arrests occurred, and many protestors were maced, hosed down with water canons in sub-freezing temperatures, and tased. Some were even shot with rubber bullets. A dramatic change took place over the first weekend in December of 2016, when over 2,000 veterans arrived at the Standing Rock protest camps. On December 4th, the U.S. Army Corps denied an easement to the parent company of the DAPL, Energy Transfer Partners. The victory was celebrated by activists present and elsewhere. However, a statement by the company soon made it clear that the oil company had no intention of re-routing the pipeline. Since the easement was denied, the world has heard little of the protestors or the DAPL. Once again, that changed just days after Donald Trump became the new President of the United States. The business tycoon-turned-politician signed an executive order that will allow the corporation to finish drilling across the Missouri river. The lack of regard for the environment or the indigenous people has once again inspired veterans to return to North Dakota. Reportedly, dozens if not hundreds of brave men and women are making plans to venture to the Sacred Stone camp to serve as human shields for those who are striving to preserve the Missouri River and its resources for future generations. Reportedly, they are hopeful that their presence makes it harder for police and government officials to try and remove hundreds of protesters who remain camped near the construction site. Credit: Indianz.Com When veterans camped out at the site in December, many put their skills to use by performing a wide range of service, such as cleaning up the camp, volunteering in the kitchen, assisting as medical support, and protecting those on the front lines from police. This is because many regret their involvement in the Iraq war. In December, the arrival of the veterans proved to be a game-changer.

Credit: Getty Images This story was updated Jan. 24, 2017, to reflect President Trump's presidential memorandum to advance construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. After months of largely peaceful protests by thousands of demonstrators from across the country who congregated at a camp near Cannon Ball, N.D., to help bring the Dakota Access pipeline to a halt, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has asked the pipeline opponents to go home. The tribe said it plans to continue its action against the pipeline in the courts, but the protest camp has run its course. It also said the tribe may call on federal law enforcement officials to help them remove protesters from all of the camps and to block their re-entry if they haven't left in 30 days. Opposition leaders said they had not immediately decided whether to retract their call to clear the camp. Several hundred protesters have remained in the camp through the winter, down from the high of nearly 10,000 in early December. The process could delay construction by a year or more and could involve rerouting the pipeline. It is still unclear what the Trump administration will do. Residents expressed frustration over a highway closure near the camp that significantly increased the driving time to Bismarck, where many residents work, shop and receive medical care. Residents also expressed concern over the Cannon Ball gym, which has been used as an emergency shelter for pipeline opponents. The community uses the gym for sporting events, meetings and funerals, and it is in need of cleaning and repair. When asked about the Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines at a press briefing on Monday, Sean Spicer, Trump's press secretary, said Trump may attempt to overrule the Army Corp's decision to halt the pipeline.

The camp area has seen frequent and sometimes violent clashes between protesters and police. North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum said the state could start lining up additional contractors as early as Thursday. Who would pay the cost could be decided later, he said. Doering said local authorities are hoping for a presidential disaster declaration to open up the prospect of federal aid. Burgum on Wednesday issued an evacuation order to complement the Corps deadline, though he said arresting people would be a last resort.

Native American tribes, led by the Standing Rock Sioux, have been protesting the pipeline project. They fear it would pollute the Missouri River and harm sacred cultural lands and tribal burial grounds. The letter from the district commander of the Army Corps, Col. John W. Henderson, said the emergency services and facilities needed to protect demonstrators camped north of the Cannonball River during the harsh North Dakota winters could not be provided. He said anyone found on the land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing. The project has spurred months of clashes between the police and demonstrators. The most serious injury happened early Monday. An explosion during a protest badly damaged the left arm and hand of woman who grew up in the Bronx, Sophia Wilansky, 21. Her father, Wayne Wilansky, said that someone from the police lines had thrown a device he described as a grenade; the police suggested that fellow demonstrators had caused the explosion, and said officers did not use concussion or flash grenades at any time. On Monday, the police confronted hundreds of protesters. Nearly 300 people were treated for injuries resulting from the use of police force, according to the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. The pipeline project was delayed in September when the Obama administration temporarily blocked it from crossing under the Missouri River. President Obama called on both sides to show restraint and revealed that the Army Corps of Engineers was considering an alternative route for the project. But Kelcy Warren, chief executive of the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, told The Associated Press it would not consider a different route. Though the project has been delayed by legal disputes, the pipeline is nearly complete.

File photo. Much of this information is neither accurate nor fair. It is the job of our three-person elected commission to handle all such matters according to state law. A 13-month review process included public-input meetings held across the state. The final route was legally approved and permitted by the state of North Dakota. The location for the crossing of the Missouri River was approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. And the easement was forwarded to the assistant secretary for signature. There are some essential facts in this unfolding situation. First and foremost, not one person from the tribe attended any of the meetings and hearings publicly noticed by state regulators over the course of two years. Those opponents who cite the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie to dispute who owns the lands conveniently ignore the later treaty of 1868. All of these facts were validated by a U.S. District Court judge in Washington, D.C., who ruled against a request for an injunction. While the right to disagree with projects such as the Dakota Access Pipeline absolutely exists, and those who disagree are welcome to exercise their right to free speech to declare that, it never should be acceptable to ignore straightforward facts and trample on a legal process that was followed carefully. It is unacceptable that the facts of the permitting process not only were omitted in much of the discussion among those who disagreed with the pipeline but were twisted in order to paint the state of North Dakota and federal government as reckless and racist. Nothing could be further from the truth. Apparently the chairman saw no reason to discourage their plans. This movement to protest the pipeline eventually grew into a collection of more than 5,000 people illegally camping on federal land. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided to allow this unpermitted presence, a decision it later would regret. From there, what began as a peaceful protest turned into an almost-daily harassment of pipeline workers and area residents. Roads were blocked; land leased by private individuals for ranching was trespassed on; property was damaged, including several head of cattle and horses slaughtered in the field; and privately owned construction equipment was vandalized. These acts were lawless and anything but peaceful. In response, law enforcement became involved in a four-month-long ordeal trying to keep state and county highways open and to protect private property. They were not always successful. To date, more than 500 arrests have been made, most of them for trespassing on private property and unauthorized public spaces. But some arrests were also for violent, threatening and destructive behavior. But many were actually professional agitators recruited by large environmental activist organizations to intimidate people to drop their support for the project. This subgroup hurled rocks and debris at law enforcement and harassed their families. This particular pipe is state-of-the-art when it comes to safety. It will be buried 92 feet below the bottom of the Missouri River. It will be double the strength of the pipe buried on land. And it will have sophisticated flow-monitoring devices on both sides of the river with automatic shut-off valves. When complete, the pipeline will deliver one-half of the petroleum production from the Bakken region to markets throughout the U.S. And it will be much, much safer from an environmental standpoint than the alternative modes of truck or rail transportation. Again, the pipeline does not cross reservation land. Nevertheless, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced Dec. 5 that, despite its own conclusions that this route achieves the least environmental impact, it will further delay the process by requiring additional study. This truly tramples on a legal and orderly process in favor of intimidation and mob rule. If we allow these tactics to succeed, we will only encourage those who have chosen illegal means over the rule of law to achieve their goals. Environmental activist organizations, which never before showed much interest in North Dakota, used a massive social-media machine to drive misinformation about the pipeline and protests and to accuse law enforcement and the National Guard of criminal mistreatment of protesters. Nothing could be further from the truth. Now that winter, including several feet of snow and subfreezing temperatures, has settled into our state, law enforcement and several neighboring communities have gone above and beyond to help rescue and shelter people who came unprepared. Public schools have been opened as shelters, and law enforcement repeatedly has given warnings to safely leave camp ahead of major storms. We are proud of the restraint and the professionalism of our law enforcement officers. Attacks on their conduct have been totally inaccurate, and I hope time will help reveal the facts surrounding this ongoing situation and that reason will prevail.

Boasberg is considering a request by the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes to order the Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw permission to lay pipe under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. The pipeline has prompted months of protests and hundreds of arrests. Ducheneaux said the judge appeared to be questioning the sincerity of the tribes' beliefs and stressed there was no other source of clean water available near the tribe's reservation. Authorities cleared a protest camp where opponents of the Dakota Access oil pipeline had gathered for the better part of a year, searching tents and huts and arresting dozens of holdouts who had defied a government order to leave. When they filed the lawsuit last summer, the tribes argued that the pipeline threatens Native American cultural sites and their water supply. Their religion argument is new, however, and both the Corps and the company building the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, argue that the delay in raising it is a reason for Boasberg to reject the argument. Most of the Dakota Access pipeline opponents abandoned their protest camp Wednesday ahead of a government deadline to get off the federal land, and authorities moved to arrest some who defied the order in a final show of dissent. The camp has been home to demonstrators for nearly a year as they... Representing the pipeline, lawyer David Debold noted that the lake has only existed since the 1950s and questioned how the purity of its water could be part of longstanding tribal religious beliefs. Earlier this month, Boasberg declined the tribes' request to order an immediate halt to the pipeline construction, ruling that as long as oil wasn't flowing through the pipeline, there was no imminent harm to the tribes. Boasberg's decision on the matter won't be the end of the court battle, as no final decision has been made on the merits of the tribes' overall claims. Both tribes also have asked Boasberg to overturn the federal permission for the Lake Oahe crossing and to bar the Corps from granting permission in the future. The judge won't rule until at least April. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of pipeline opponents who sided with tribal opposition to the pipeline camped on federal land near the drill site for months, often clashing with police. There have been about 750 arrests in the region since August. Authorities last week closed the camp in advance of spring flooding season and set up roadblocks to prevent protesters from returning. Work under Lake Oahe had been held up in the courts until President Donald Trump last month instructed the Corps to advance construction. The Army is involved because its engineering branch manages the river and its system of hydroelectric dams, which is owned by the federal government. Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners began drilling under the lake Feb. 8. The pipeline could be operating as early as Monday and no later than early April, according to Scherman.

The Post stated: If Ou had already been inside the U.S. border, law enforcement officers would have needed a warrant to search his smartphones to comply with a 2014 Supreme Court ruling. But the journalist learned the hard way that the same rules don't apply at the border, where the government claims the right to search electronic devices without a warrant or any suspicion of wrongdoing. ... Ou said he's unclear about why he was detained. Hugh Handeyside of the American Civil Liberties Union wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security expressing concerns over Ou's detention. 10:17 a.m. Federal officials said anyone found on the land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing. Musician Neil Young and his girlfriend, actor Daryl Hannah, posted a statement of support on Young's Facebook page: A few weeks ago we traveled to visit the Standing Rock Sioux In North Dakota. We arrived at this unprecedented historical gathering of over five hundred tribes and thousands of others standing on the front lines to protect water, to state the most basic human truth, to say water is life. Despite the painful history, today they fight peacefully for us all. ... All here together, with their non-native relatives, standing strong in the face of outrageous, unnecessary and violent aggression, on the part of militarized local and state law enforcement agencies and National Guard, who are seemingly acting to protect the interests of the Dakota Access Pipeline profiteers, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of tax-payer dollars, above all other expressed concerns. They stand against corporate security forces, the county sheriff and the National Guard. Standing while being hit with water cannons, mace, tear gas, rubber bullets. Standing without weapons and praying, the water protectors endure human rights abuses in sub freezing temperatures. Supplies arrive from all over as the social media universe shares the heartbreaking news to the world, that an American corporate media is not free to report. Thus, it is the ugliness of corporate America, seen around the world. PST Tuesday: In another disturbing update from Standing Rock, Reuters reports: North Dakota law enforcement will begin to block supplies from reaching protesters at a camp near the construction site of an oil pipeline project in an effort to force demonstrators to vacate the area, officials said on Tuesday. The order was effective immediately. As of Tuesday morning, however, no vehicles carrying supplies had been turned back, said Cecily Fong, a spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. 10:14 a.m. Archambault noted that the evacuation order, which the governor said he issued for the campers' well-being in the face of dangerous winter weather, came a week after police turned water hoses on protesters in sub-freezing temperatures. ... The governor did not specify how he intended to enforce his order other than by directing state and local agencies to refuse emergency assistance and other services to anyone who remained at the site. But Standing Rock Sioux spokeswoman Phyllis Young told a news conference Monday night the tribe would stand its ground. That is our camp. As Dalrymple noted, the weather is increasingly harsh. Many are gathered around fires for prayer and warmth. 2:06 p.m. PST Saturday: A critical new development in the situation in North Dakota unfolded late Friday when the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the abandonment of one of the main encampments at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The Army Corps, the main force behind the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, sent a letter to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, as NBC News reports: Citing increased violence between protesters and law enforcement and the increasingly harsh winter conditions, the Army Corps said it decided to close its land to the protesters who have been there since early April. This will shut down the Oceti Sakowin camp, which is one of the three camps located near the construction site. That's kind of supposed to already be all of America. 1:25 p.m. PST Friday: Thousands gathered at Standing Rock for peaceful prayer circles and demonstrations on Thanksgiving Day. After they crossed, protesters gathered in a prayer circle, marking the moment by holding hands and singing. She describes a humanizing scene, where despite the tension, police and protesters were able to converse without clashing. It was peaceful. The violent origins of Thanksgiving made yesterday's peaceful action all the more significant. 8:11 a.m. The jail is burdened. Monet also suggests that phone calls to authorities from supporters of the demonstrators are influencing authorities' decision-making. All this comes amid an increasingly loud public outcry against the militarized policing. Organized campaigns to contact the people and agencies responsible for sending officers and equipment to aid Morton County in the assaults on water protectors have in some cases been effective. The article has been published by media worldwide. He and his deputies were en route to Morton County when Gov. Steve Bullock raised concerns about the potential misuse of the interstate statute. The Emergency Management Assistance Compact obligates law enforcement around the country to fulfill requests for aid under any form of emergency or disaster. All that caused Sheriff Gootkin to change his mind. It was not an easy choice to make, Gootkin said. Then, he raised a question that has begun to rattle many communities across America lately. It really breaks my heart. Watch the full clip below (Aaron Murphy via Facebook): 11:49 a.m. PST Wednesday: Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., penned a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch earlier this week, imploring her to protect the demonstrators. It reads: Dear Attorney General Lynch, I am extremely concerned after hearing reports of dangerous clashes between police and protesters of the Dakota Access Pipeline project near Cannon Ball, ND. The reported use of water cannons for crowd control in sub-freezing temperatures is excessive and unnecessary, and I urge you to take action to protect the First Amendment rights ofprotestors, and the physical safety of all involved parties. Video of the incident appears to show that the water cannons were not simply being used for fire control, or even crowd control, but were often directed at small crowds or even individual protesters. Combined with the onset of wintry weather, water cannons are extremely dangerous and potentially lethal weapons, and I urge you to investigate their use on protesters. On November 14, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that additioual analysis of the Dakota Access Pipeline project is necessary and invited the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to engage due to potential impact of a pipeline leak on the Tribe's drinking water supply. Native American populations have struggled for decades under the complex burden of historical trauma, and I have witnessed and admired how these communities have turned to their cultural foundations to build strength against that burden. These tactics against protesters exercising their Constitutional rights threaten to add another layer of trauma to these communities. I urge you to do everything in your power to prevent further escalation of violence. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Fortune provides more information on Sunoco's acquisition of Energy Transfer Partners: Pipeline companies Sunoco Logistics Partners and Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), both of which are controlled by general partner Energy Transfer Equity, said on Monday they would combine in a corporate consolidation to cut borrowing and operating costs. The pipeline corporation will remain in the hands of Dallas billionaire Kelcy Warren. 6:32 p.m. PST Tuesday: A special gathering is slated to take place on Thursday at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The participants will honor and serve dinner to 500 Native American water protectors who have been demonstrating against the Dakota Access pipeline project. Truthdig will follow along as the Wopila Feast takes place. Watch for updates on Thursday. 2:42 p.m. PST Tuesday: The Standing Rock Medic & Healer Council has released new information about the condition of 21-year-old activist Sophia Wilansky, who was taken to the hospital and initially declared to be in critical condition after Sunday night's clash with law enforcement left her with a severely injured arm. Wilansky's father also provided a statement: A grenade exploded right as it hit Sophia in the left forearm taking most of the undersurface of her left arm with it. Both her radial and ulnar artery were completely destroyed. Her radius was shattered and a large piece of it is missing. Her medial nerve is missing a large section as well. All of the muscle and soft tissue between her elbow and wrist were blown away. The police did not do this by accident - it was an intentional act of throwing it directly at her. ... Sophia will have surgery again tomorrow as bit by bit they try to rebuild a somewhat functioning arm and hand. The first surgery took a vein from her leg which they have implanted in her arm to take the place of the missing arteries. She will need multiple surgeries to try to gain some functional use of the arm and hand. She will be, every day for the foreseeable future, fearful of losing her arm and hand. There are no words to describe the pain of watching my daughter cry and say she was sorry for the pain she caused me and my wife. I died a thousand deaths today and will continue to do so for quite some time. I am left without the right words to describe the anguish of watching her look at her now alien arm and hand. According to the list, currently, a total of 75 different law enforcement organizations have provided assistance to the Morton County Sheriff's Department. 11:02 a.m. ... Wilansky was evacuated and airlifted to a Minneapolis hospital. After hours of surgery, she posted on Facebook early this morning that her arm has not been amputated, but she will not know for another week whether amputation might be required. Wilansky is from New York City and has organized against the construction of pipelines, including the AIM Spectra pipeline, in New York and across the East Coast. Wilansky's father reportedly released images of her injury (warning: extremely graphic). According to the Standing Rock Medic & Healer Council, approximately 300 people were injured during Sunday's confrontation with law enforcement. In a statement issued on its Facebook page, the council wrote: These 300 injuries were the direct result of excessive force by police over the course of 10 hours. At least 26 seriously injured people had to be evacuated by ambulance to 3 area hospitals. Police continuously assaulted demonstrators with up to three water cannons for the first 7 hours of this incident in subfreezing temperatures dipping to 22F (-5.5C) causing hypothermia in the majority of patients treated. Chemical weapons in the form of pepper spray and tear gas were also used extensively, requiring chemical decontamination for nearly all patients treated and severe reactions in many. Projectiles in the form of tear gas canisters, rubber bullets, and concussion grenades led to numerous blunt force traumas including head wounds, lacerations, serious orthopedic injuries, eye trauma, and internal bleeding. Amnesty International is reportedly sending a fourth delegation to North Dakota in the wake of Sunday's violence, and the organization's U.S. executive director, Margaret Huangin, wrote a letter to the Morton County Sheriff's Department condemning police tactics. It is the legitimate right of people to peacefully express their opinion. Public assemblies should not be considered as the 'enemy'. Truthdig contributor Sonali Kolhatkar spoke with Nick Tilsen, executive director of Thunder Valley Community Development Corp. and a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe. Tilsen was present during Sunday night's confrontation. Water protectors, for nearly a month, have been held off from removing a barricade put in place for the protection of the Oceti Sakowin, Sacred Stone, and Rosebud encampments as threats of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Morton County Sheriffs clearing out camp mounted. People attempted to peacefully remove the barricade and were attacked for doing so. An elder went into cardiac arrest on the frontline. Many, many live videos show the opposite occurring. We call on them to TELL THE TRUTH. Secondly, we call on President Obama to create and sign an executive order that cancels the Dakota Access Pipeline like he did with the Keystone XL. We call on President Obama to not let Trump be the bad guy who handles this. We call on him to be the change he promised when he was campaigning to be President. We call on him to uphold his words of hope. 9:36 a.m. PST Monday: Truthdig correspondent Donald Kaufman reports on the clash between police and the water protectors. They are being trapped and attacked. According to Jade Begay, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network, 167 people were injured and seven were taken to the hospital. A spokesman for the sheriff's department said that law enforcement was spraying water because protesters were lighting fires on and around the bridge. 12:19 p.m. PST Thursday: Unicorn Riot has shared video footage of an arrest made in Bismarck, N.D., earlier Thursday: Police beat water protector in zip ties until bleeding from head, dislocate arm, then place bag over head as cops continue beating. Kaufman explains that Fallis' supporters allege that she was unjustly charged with attempted murder after police arrested her. Demonstrators in Mandan County today are demanding Red Fawn's release. Kaufman shared live video footage of the unfolding events: Scroll down to see more photos and videos of the demonstrations. 10:22 a.m. PST Thursday: Peaceful protesters gathered in Bismarck, N.D. early Thursday. Truthdig's Donald Kaufman is following the demonstrations and sending live updates. He also shared live video of the demonstrations on Truthdig's Facebook page: Scroll down to see more live updates embedded in the Evrybit story at the bottom of this page. It is the continuation of resistance to centuries of repression and oppression. Donald Kaufman wrote a firsthand account of what's happening on the ground at Standing Rock. 2:04 p.m. PST Wednesday: As today's demonstrations come to a close, take some time to learn more about the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's fight. Watch the short film below: 12:02 p.m. PST Wednesday: Donald Kaufman reports that Wednesday's action at the Bank of North Dakota has ended. For example, on Tuesday, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made an appearance at one of the camps. 10:22 a.m. PST Wednesday: Peaceful protesters, determined to halt construction of the proposed Dakota Access pipeline, rallied outside the Bank of North Dakota in Bismarck on Wednesday morning. The protesters chose the bank because, they allege, it funds treaty violations against the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Sanders also criticized Trump's pro-fossil fuel position.

But the fact that the officers have even tried to communicate with activists is alarming to free-speech experts who argue that anti-terrorism agents have no business scrutinizing protesters. Regan, who has regularly visited Standing Rock and is the executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center in Oregon, said she learned of three cases in which officers with the taskforce, known as the JTTF, tried to talk to activists in person. The three individuals, who include a Native American and a non-indigenous activist, asserted their fifth amendment rights and did not respond to the officers, according to Regan, who declined to identify them to protect their privacy and out of fear of retribution. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Construction equipment near the Dakota Access pipeline. Workers have begun drilling after the army corps granted the permit necessary. Trump, a former investor in Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based firm behind the pipeline, took executive action in his first week in office to expedite the project. On Wednesday, workers began drilling to complete the pipeline across the Missouri river. The JTTF revelation comes at a time when there have been increasing concerns at Standing Rock about law enforcement surveillance, police violence and the targeted arrests and prosecutions of activists. Since the summer, law enforcement officials have made roughly 700 arrests, in some cases leading to serious felony charges and possibly lengthy state prison sentences. Following recent indictments, at least six activists are now facing charges in federal court. Rumors about JTTF have caused further stress among the activists. Regan said she was able to confirm the identity of one of the JTTF officers, Andrew Creed, who attempted to contact an activist. In November, a JTTF officer also showed up to the hospital room of Sophia Wilansky, a 21-year-old who was seriously injured during a standoff with law enforcement at Standing Rock, according to her father, Wayne Wilansky. The FBI took her clothes and still have not returned them, he said in an interview this week. Witnesses have said they believe she was hit by a police concussion grenade. The timing of the FBI hospital visit in Minneapolis was upsetting, he added. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Activists at Standing Rock have faced blizzard conditions at the camp during the winter months. How Keystone XL and Dakota Access went from opposition to resurrection Read more The attorney said it also seemed likely that JTTF may have contacted other water protectors and said she worried they may not have realized their best option is to remain silent and contact a lawyer. This is not the first time the JTTF has been tied to an investigation of civil rights protesters. Records from Minnesota suggested that the taskforce monitored a Black Lives Matter demonstration. For indigenous leaders who have vowed to continue fighting the pipeline on the ground, the FBI investigations and ongoing federal prosecutions have become increasingly worrisome.

Many activists traveled to Washington, D.C., from Standing Rock, where they had been camping out for months in opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline.

In 1877, the U.S. government initiated the still ongoing process of chipping away and dividing the land it had granted to the people of the Lakota and Dakota nations, with significant reductions taking place in 1889 and then again during the 1950s and 1960s, when the Army Corps of Engineers built five large dams along the Missouri River, uprooting villages and sinking 200,000 acres of land below water. Because the Corps neglected to consult the Standing Rock Sioux, as it was required to do under the National Historic Preservation Act (Section 106), the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Interior, and the American Council on Historic Preservation all criticized the assessment, but the project was eventually approved. For the Standing Rock Sioux, the Dakota Access project poses two immediate threats. First, the pipeline would run beneath Lake Oahe, the reservoir that provides drinking water to the people of Standing Rock. But as the protests have intensified, and more outsiders, including members of more than 200 Native American tribes from across the North America, have become involved, Standing Rock has, for some, come to represent something much bigger than a struggle between a disenfranchised people and a government-backed, billion-dollar corporation. I am a mother and a grandmother. Young grew up on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. It was Young who got Clark Jr involved. In late summer, she was in Washington, D.C., lobbying for the military to promote an alternative (and scientifically dubious) clean energy source called low-energy nuclear reaction, when she heard of a military veteran who was a forceful advocate for environmental conservation. Clark Jr. was eager to help. He spent weeks trying to assemble a legal team for the Standing Rock Sioux, and even contacted Independent Diplomat, a nonprofit organization that helps governments navigate complex diplomatic processes. Lots of them. Wesley Clark Sr. retired from the Army in 2000 as a four-star general. His career began in the jungles of Vietnam, where he was shot four timesduring an enemy ambush near Saigon, and culminated in a posting as Supreme Allied Commander Europe during the Kosovo War. In 2004, he ran for the Democratic Party presidential nomination on platform that criticized the Iraq War and called for measures to combat climate change. On Sept. 11, 2001, he was living in New York City, and after seeing the towers fall, he decided to re-enlist. It was Clark Sr., the decorated war hero, who convinced him not to. As Clark Jr. recalls, his father foresaw U.S. military intervention in Iraq and warned that as a soldier he would be fighting a war that had nothing to do with defeating al Qaeda. Clark Jr. may never have served in combat, but when he talks about Standing Rock, he sounds like a battle-hardened general. A packing list virtually mirrors the ones issued to soldiers preparing to deploy to the field (minus the weapons). But there are also parts of the document that read like a revolutionary manifesto. The money, Clark Jr. says, will only be used for helping volunteers with transportation costs and then bailing those who are arrested out of jail. The following morning they will join members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, including Young, for a traditional healing ceremony. With an eye toward the media, old military uniforms will be donned so that if the veterans are brutalized by the police, they are brutalized not as ordinary citizens, but as people who once served the government they are protesting against. Bagpipes will play, and traditional Sioux war songs will be sung. The music will continue as everyone marches together to the banks of the Missouri, on the other side of which a line of guards in riot gear will be standing ready with rifles, mace, batons, and dogs. The goal is to make it to the drilling pad and surround it, arm in arm. Of course, as most veterans know full well, even the best plans go out the window the moment the shit hits the fan. It seems probable that the group will be met by fierce resistance from those charged with keeping people out of the construction site. Despite a recent decision by the Corps of Engineers to delay further work on the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners is still hoping to complete the project by January. The segment that will cross beneath the Missouri at Standing Rock is the last major piece of the puzzle. Nonetheless, Clark Jr. and Wood Jr. remain undeterred. If anything, the likelihood of approval only makes them more determined. After all, this is war.

Trump, a former investor in Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based firm behind the pipeline, took executive action in his first week in office to expedite the project. On Wednesday, workers began drilling to complete the pipeline across the Missouri river. The JTTF revelation comes at a time when there have been increasing concerns at Standing Rock about law enforcement surveillance, police violence and the targeted arrests and prosecutions of activists. Since the summer, law enforcement officials have made roughly 700 arrests, in some cases leading to serious felony charges and possibly lengthy state prison sentences. Following recent indictments, at least six activists are now facing charges in federal court. Rumors about JTTF have caused further stress among the activists. Regan said she was able to confirm the identity of one of the JTTF officers, Andrew Creed, who attempted to contact an activist. In November, a JTTF officer also showed up to the hospital room of Sophia Wilansky, a 21-year-old who was seriously injured during a standoff with law enforcement at Standing Rock, according to her father, Wayne Wilansky. The FBI took her clothes and still have not returned them, he said in an interview this week. Witnesses have said they believe she was hit by a police concussion grenade.

Proponents of the pipeline say that it will help the U.S. achieve energy independence, and that the pipeline would be far more efficient than oil transport by rail.

The pipeline was originally supposed to pass close to North Dakota's capital, populated mostly by residents of European descent, but that route did not pass muster in an environmental impact assessment.

There was no immediate response from Energy Transfer Partners, but its chief executive, Kelcy Warren, has said that the company was unwilling to reroute the pipeline, which is intended to transport as much as 550,000 barrels of oil a day from the oil fields of western North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois.

About 1 million barrels a day are currently produced in North Dakota. The more than 800,000 bpd Keystone XL pipeline would bring heavy crude from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The project was conceived nearly a decade ago, but since then the U.S. shale revolution has redefined oil flows, with domestic refiners finding themselves awash with supply and needing fewer imports. Environmental activists campaigned against the Keystone XL pipeline for more than seven years, eventually winning a victory when Obama rejected the project in 2015. TransCanada shares closed up 2.7 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Trump said on Tuesday in Washington that Keystone XL would create 28,000 jobs, but that figure is at odds with a 2014 U.S. State Department environmental study that said the project would create 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs. U.S. President Donald Trump holds up a signed executive order to advance construction of the Keystone XL pipeline at the White House in Washington January 24, 2017. The Army Corps earlier this month said it would begin an environmental assessment that could delay the project further.

The cause was being investigated. The pipeline transports crude from Alberta, Canada, to refineries in Illinois and Oklahoma, passing through the eastern Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri. It can handle nearly 600,000 barrels, or about 23 million gallons, daily. TransCanada says on its website that the company has safely transported more than 1.5 billion barrels of oil, or about 63 billion gallons, through the system since operations began in 2010. There have been over 200 significant leaks in these pipelines since the year 2000. The Project has been defending activists who oppose the Keystone XL pipeline, an extension of the Keystone project, because it passes close to tribal lands and could endanger their drinking supply. TransCanada said in its statement that it expected the pipeline to remain shut down as the company responds to the leak. It did not offer a time estimate. The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration didn't immediately return an email requesting additional information from The Associated Press. A leak and spill in southeastern South Dakota in April 2016 prompted a weeklong shutdown of the pipeline. TransCanada estimated that just under 17,000 gallons of oil spilled onto private land during that leak. No waterways or aquifers were affected. TransCanada said at the time that the leak was the first detected on the pipeline since it began operating, though there had been leaks at pumping stations. One of those leaks happened in southeastern North Dakota in May 2011, when 14,000 gallons spilled after a valve failed at a pumping station near the South Dakota border. The Keystone Pipeline is part of a 2,687-mile system that also is to include the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which has faced persistent opposition from environmental groups, American Indian tribes and some landowners.

The indigenous activists of Standing Rock, North Dakota, won a major victory on Sunday in their battle to halt the Dakota Access Pipeline. In an unprecedented move, the Department of the Army - under Obama's watch - said it would block construction below the Missouri River at Lake Oahe and force stakeholders to look for alternative routes. It's an enormous breakthrough. But it wasn't easy - and the decision could still be overturned under Trump. Huck met the activists holding fort at Standing Rock as they buckled down for winter and the hope of victory was still a distant dream. This is their story. A prayer march to sacred sites destroyed by pipeline construction the previous Saturday had been shut down by police, who surrounded the group as Lauren tried to get a young boy out of danger. All the guns were pointing at us. There was mace, there were riot shields and batons, and hundreds of police and armoured vehicles. She says they started hitting her head and hands as she tried to protect herself. She was pulled back into the crowd by friends, and managed to escape, but others were charged with crimes including rioting, trespassing and resisting arrest. Despite the fact that the company overseeing DAPL, Energy Transfer Partners, lacked the necessary permit to drill under Lake Oahe, and despite government departments requesting that they voluntarily halt construction in September, building continued as close to the water as workers could get. When Lauren returned to the frontline, a group had decided to physically block the pipeline route. All the long-term encampments at Standing Rock are on tribal-owned or -leased land. In the intervening decades, the land had been taken back without being formally ceded by the Sioux, who were ancestors of the current Standing Rock Sioux Nation. The police gave the protectors a deadline to clear the site, and when it passed, they moved in with hundreds of officers in riot gear, armoured cars and two helicopters. They blasted sound cannons and pepper spray, fired rubber bullets and beanbag rounds, set off concussion grenades and hit one man in the face with a taser barb. Three people locked themselves to a truck and a blockade was set on fire, creating billowing towers of black smoke. Lauren is explaining all this the following day, as the people gathering at Standing Rock catch their breath, crowdsource bail money and discuss next steps. Jasilyn Charger, front. But by August, Jasilyn became frustrated. We know how it feels not having a voice. There are more women warriors than there are men here. We know women all over the country who know how it feels to be raped. Youth council members are helping out around the camp, organising prayer gatherings and apprenticing themselves with medics and legal teams. Those supporting it argue that the new infrastructure will create jobs and decrease dependence on foreign oil, and they insist that pipes are deeply buried and strong enough to stay intact. As recently as 21 October, a Sunoco pipeline broke in Pennsylvania, spilling about 55,000 gallons of gasoline into the Susquehanna River, and residents living nearby were advised to reduce their water use. In mid-November, they announced that further consultation was needed before Energy Transfer Partners are granted permission to complete the pipeline. Protectors say that sacred sites have already been bulldozed in the DAPL construction process, that people were dragged out of religious ceremonies to be arrested, and that there was a failure to properly consult tribal elders as leaders of sovereign nations. Remy is camped at Oceti Sakowin and prefers to withhold his full name. The reservation, he says, was surrounded by seven coal-fired plants (of which six persist today) that have been linked to birth defects and asthma among the local population, who are still living in houses with no electricity or running water. Statistics bear this out. Originally, the proposed DAPL route crossed the Missouri about 10 miles upstream of the state capital of Bismarck, but the plan was rejected by the Army Corps for reasons that included the risk to the municipal water supply. For Remy, this is part of what it means to grow up in a Native American community. She sees the fight against DAPL as part of a larger struggle to uplift indigenous communities across the continent. We see the reservations as prisoner-of-war camps. We still carry that trauma. We want to live in peace. We want to go back to our heritage. Against this backdrop, the gathering of people from more than 300 Native American tribes at Standing Rock offers an opportunity for communal cultural and spiritual celebration, as well as defiance. Three times a day, the encampments gather for meals around a constantly burning sacred fire, with offerings made to the Creator, and elders and children served first. Traditions from across the continent are shared, and there are displays of horsemanship, regular sweat lodge ceremonies, singing and prayers. Linda Black Elk is an ethnobotanist and teacher at the nearby Sitting Bull College, who has been spending recent weeks documenting local plant life that is being endangered by the pipeline construction and supporting the medical teams at Standing Rock. This is what it feels like to be able to defend your land for your children, to be able to defend their culture from continued genocide. There are few home comforts here: sub-zero temperatures at night, little cellphone or internet reception, no running water or electricity. People want to get back to living closer to Mother Earth.

Photograph by Alyssa Schukar, The New York Times, Redux 4 Key Impacts of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipelines The controversial projects may affect animals, climate, and people. By Heather Brady PUBLISHED January 25, 2017 President Donald Trump signed executive orders early this week that restarted the effort to complete the Keystone XL pipeline across the Great Plains (see a map of the route) and the Dakota Access pipeline in the northern plains. The critically endangered whooping crane is at risk of flying into new power lines that would be constructed to keep oil pumping through the Keystone XL pipeline, the National Wildlife Federation has said. The Keystone XL pipeline route would go through most of the remaining locations of the swift fox, a tiny canid about the size of a house cat. There are nine threatened, endangered, and candidate species in the areas that the Dakota Access pipeline would run through, according to an environmental assessment by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published in May 2016. The assessment concluded that the pipeline does not pose a specific threat to any of their habitats. 2. How the Pipelines May Impact Oil Production If the Keystone XL pipeline is built, about 830,000 barrels of heavy crude oil per day will flow from Alberta, Canada, to the refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast, which are built to handle the kind of heavy crude oil that comes out of the tar sands. Those refineries need crude oil in order to function and to support the people who work there, and places like Mexico and Venezuela, which typically export oil to the U.S., are beginning to run out of it. Their father bought the motel in 2003 but has been in the hotel business since the early 1970s. Patel takes a photo of her father (at right) and his two siblings inside the Vincent Hotel as her sisters, Sita and Katki, look on. Patel and his father, Mahendra, stand in front of Hotel Zico in Mountain View, California. Kalia (right) talks to Victor Floyd, a veteran and resident of the Palms Inn in Santa Rosa, California. The center hosts regular social gatherings for residents and offers social services. His parents bought their first motel, in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles, in 1979. These steps are intended to help minimize the harm of an oil spill if one happens. The alternative to a pipeline also presents concerns. The State Department estimated that as of January 2014, 180,000 barrels of Canadian crude oil per day is being transported by freight trains. If no pipeline is built, that number will rise. Using trains to transport oil to refineries in the U.S. poses a safety concern because explosions can occur, killing people and damaging habitats nearby. The Dakota Access pipeline project was meant to address the growing amount of oil being shipped out of North Dakota by freight trains. 3. What the Pipelines Mean for Climate Many climate activists have opposed the pipelines on the suspicion that they may increase our reliance on, and use, of fossil fuels, and further delay investment in more renewable technologies. But the State Department said in a 2014 assessment that the Keystone XL pipeline would have no additional impact on greenhouse gas emissions because the oil would be extracted from tar sands in Canada at the same rate anyways, regardless of whether or not the pipeline was built. The EPA contested that finding, saying that extracting oil from the tar sands generates more greenhouse gases than extracting oil through more conventional methods and therefore contributes to a greater amount of greenhouse gas emissions over time. If more pipelines are built, more oil could theoretically be extracted at a faster rate, meaning greenhouse gases would actually be released more quickly. The volatile market also does not guarantee that demand will make the high cost of extracting oil from the tar sands worthwhile. But the protesters remain. Here, they camp near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Using trains slows down the process of getting the oil to refineries and ultimately to market, so it is better long-term for the environment, the groups said. No environmental impact report has been created for the Dakota Access pipeline, though the U.S Army Corps of Engineers said they would conduct an environmental impact survey when they halted the project in December 2016. The Dakota Access pipeline project has encountered fierce opposition in part because the threat of an oil spill and poisoned water sources could impact the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation is immediately downstream of the point where the pipeline will cross the Missouri River. Many tribe members are also concerned about burial grounds being disturbed during construction of the pipeline. Bulldozers have already removed some topsoil on ground that the tribe considers sacred. Both pipelines would create jobs during their construction. If the pipeline is not built, it could eventually endanger jobs at those refineries. Energy Transfer Partners says the Dakota Access pipeline would create up to 12,000 jobs during its construction. It would create around 40 permanent jobs."}, {"URL": "http://www.reuters.com/article/north-dakota-pipeline-idUSL3N1H14YJ", "Timestamp": "20180918224629", "Sentences": "This is among the biggest spills in the state's history, the AP report said quoting Health Department environmental scientist, Bill Seuss.

What You Can Do to Help 1. Join the Native Tribes March on Washington on Friday March 10. Over 360 tribes will march from the Mall to the Capitol building. Allies are welcome. Come peaceful, come respectful, show solidarity. 2. Avoid Exploiters That Feed Off NoDAPL. These people, sites, and groups divert funds, time, and effort from NoDAPL for their own profit or self promotion: Andras Corben Arthan, Earthspirit Community-Falsely claims to be doing Native ceremony. Sean Henry AKA Nanyu Shaabu Eil- Black supremacist claims to be a Native leader. Anne Wilson Schaef- Cult leader claiming to be Cherokee, long history of abusing followers.

There are many sites that have falsely reported deaths or attacks by police. This makes the public less likely to believe actual police abuses, which have been numerous. Many racist sites have also spread rumors falsely claiming violence by water protectors or there being armed or committing crimes. Always double check the facts before reposting anything on social media. 4. Divest from Banks Supporting the Pipeline. Many argue this is the best way to win, now that there is a would-be president with financial ties to the company building the Dakota Pipeline. The US banks listed below are invested in and will profit from Dakota Pipeline. Already numerous tribes and the City of Seattle have divested. If you have accounts with any of these, call, email, and write your bank and ask them to divest. State your concerns forcefully and respectfully and that you will close your accounts and urge others to do the same. Then follow up by doing so and tell your friends what you did, urging them to do the same. ph: 866-249-3302 Corporate Office: 420 Montgomery Street, San Francisco, CA 94104 SunTrust CEO William H.

The good news is that camps at Standing Rock, and in Florida, Minnesota, and Texas, are far from finished. If you still wish to go: DO NOT ask others to raise funds for you that could instead go to those already there. DO NOT use up the supplies there. Bring your own, including weather appropriate clothing, tents, and fuel. DO follow the directions of Native leaders onsite. This includes no drug or alcohol use, no drums or guitars.

It comes as North Dakota law enforcement backed away from a previous plan to cut off supplies to the camp - an idea quickly abandoned after an outcry and with law enforcement's treatment of Dakota Access Pipeline protesters increasingly under the microscope. Protesters include various Native American tribes as well as environmentalists and even actors including Shailene Woodley. State officials issued an order on Monday for activists to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, citing harsh weather conditions. The state's latest decision not to stop cars entering the protest site indicated local officials will not actively enforce Monday's emergency order to evacuate the camp issued by Governor Jack Dalrymple. Dakota Access Pipeline protesters square off against police between the Standing Rock Reservation and the pipeline route outside the little town of Saint Anthony, North Dakota, U.S., October 5, 2016. The 1,172-mile (1,885 km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, is mostly complete, except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. Veterans Stand for Standing Rock, a contingent of more than 2,000 U.S. military veterans, intends to go to North Dakota by this weekend and form a human wall in front of police, protest organizers said on a Facebook page. Organizers could not immediately be reached for comment. Dull Knife, a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe from the Pine Ridge Reservation of South Dakota, said he has been camping at the protest site for months. Morton County Sheriff's Office spokesman Rob Keller said in an email his agency was aware of the veterans' plans, but would not comment further on how law enforcement will deal with demonstrators. Former U.S. Marine Michael A. Wood Jr is leading the effort along with Wesley Clark Jr, a writer whose father is retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark. U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii and a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has said on Twitter she will join the protesters on Sunday. Local law enforcement said on Tuesday they planned a blockade of the camp, but local and state officials later retreated, saying they would only check vehicles for certain prohibited supplies like propane, and possibly issue fines. Dalrymple on Wednesday said state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and there had been no plans to block food or other supplies from the camp. He also warned protesters that while emergency responders will try to reach anyone in need, that would be contingent on weather conditions. That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps.

So after a day of joyous celebration last night, today we have to get ready for the next step. Already DAPL has issued a statement saying what was done last night won't deter them. The Tribe and their allies remain committed to waging the battle along several fronts. In the camps around the construction site, thousands of people, including citizens from 300 Native American Nations, remain gathered in a prayerful and peaceful community. Three thousand veterans joined advocates this weekend to stand with them against future construction. Monday afternoon, Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II participated in a webinar with financial investors to discuss the future viability of the DAPL. We thank the tribal youth who initiated this movement. We thank the millions of people around the globe who expressed support for our cause. Who knows what may happen under a pro-pipeline Trump administration, and as legal challenges against the DAPL work through the courts. Always. What happened yesterday was that the United States government said that the needs of our native population must be a priority. That was historic. Regardless of what happens with the Dakota Access Pipeline, that moment - that acknowledgement - can't ever be taken away. So as the water protectors celebrate being heard, many plan to stay vigilant in the camps until the last pieces of machinery are removed from the construction site, even though Tribe Chairman Archambault asked them to go home for the winter. Give thanks for the remarkable leadership of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation, their allied water protectors, and the millions of people around the world who have declared their solidarity in standing with Standing Rock.

Many protesters are preparing to leave the camp. The rising waters, and a federal eviction notice for Feb. 22, have forced their hands. Others say they will stay and fight the Army Corps of Engineers, which decided last week to allow completion of the 1,172-mile pipeline. The drilling began last week. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has joined a motion by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe to halt the drilling. Horses still run free in the camp. Small packs of dogs dart about, tussling in the snow, their barks drowned out by the incessant whine of a snowmobile that wends its way through the slushy mess. Everything is white, brown, gray. The only flashes of color come from weatherworn tribal flags, banners that were jubilantly raised last summer and now, some in tatters, snap to and fro in the ever-changing wind. One day soon, all of this will be gone: the tepees packed away, the yurts pulled down, the abandoned tents and sleeping bags and boxes of belongings scraped up by bulldozers into waiting dumpsters and hauled off to landfills. Josh Dayrider, a member of the Blackfeet Nation of Montana, has been at the camp off and on since early last year. We woke the world up by showing how the oil companies treat the land and the people. Tanya Olsen stood next to her mini-camper, pulling out a mattress that had been soaked by rising waters. She arrived here in November. I knew very little about pipelines. But what really caught my attention was the mistreatment of the Natives here. As she prepares to leave, Olsen says she takes solace from the impact the year-long protest has had on tribes. The yell is picked up and repeated from different corners of the camp for a minute or so, echoing up to a snowy bluff overlooking the encampment where state and local police sit in a fleet of law enforcement vehicles, monitoring comings and goings. Quiet returns. But he arrived at Reagan National Airport to learn that final approval had been granted while he was en route. Their teacher, Kim Warren, a tribal member, said she made regular visits to the main camp in the fall, believing the protest was a necessary and valuable one. As legal options dwindle and the prospect of a completed pipeline that could begin transporting more than 500,000 barrels of crude oil a day in two to three months appears more likely, its opponents are taking stock. Dallas Goldtooth has been one of the leading voices of the protest, filing regular Facebook Live feeds to share the most recent developments. An environmental activist who is an Isanti Dakota from Minnesota, he wants supporters to know that their participation has not been in vain, no matter what the outcome. The fight never stops. It builds. It moves. Some activists have called for more protesters to come out to the site, but the Standing Rock tribe has discouraged that, asking that opposition be directed at the local level and at a March 10 march planned for Native American rights in Washington. The tribe welcomed the 200 or so Native tribes that gathered here in late summer and fall to help their cause, and it welcomed the national and international support that followed.

But the fact that the officers have even tried to communicate with activists is alarming to free-speech experts who argue that anti-terrorism agents have no business scrutinizing protesters. Regan, who has regularly visited Standing Rock and is the executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center in Oregon, said she learned of three cases in which officers with the taskforce, known as the JTTF, tried to talk to activists in person. The three individuals, who include a Native American and a non-indigenous activist, asserted their fifth amendment rights and did not respond to the officers, according to Regan, who declined to identify them to protect their privacy and out of fear of retribution. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Construction equipment near the Dakota Access pipeline. Workers have begun drilling after the army corps granted the permit necessary. Trump, a former investor in Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based firm behind the pipeline, took executive action in his first week in office to expedite the project. On Wednesday, workers began drilling to complete the pipeline across the Missouri river. The JTTF revelation comes at a time when there have been increasing concerns at Standing Rock about law enforcement surveillance, police violence and the targeted arrests and prosecutions of activists. Since the summer, law enforcement officials have made roughly 700 arrests, in some cases leading to serious felony charges and possibly lengthy state prison sentences. Following recent indictments, at least six activists are now facing charges in federal court. Rumors about JTTF have caused further stress among the activists. Regan said she was able to confirm the identity of one of the JTTF officers, Andrew Creed, who attempted to contact an activist. In November, a JTTF officer also showed up to the hospital room of Sophia Wilansky, a 21-year-old who was seriously injured during a standoff with law enforcement at Standing Rock, according to her father, Wayne Wilansky. The FBI took her clothes and still have not returned them, he said in an interview this week. Witnesses have said they believe she was hit by a police concussion grenade. The timing of the FBI hospital visit in Minneapolis was upsetting, he added. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Activists at Standing Rock have faced blizzard conditions at the camp during the winter months. How Keystone XL and Dakota Access went from opposition to resurrection Read more The attorney said it also seemed likely that JTTF may have contacted other water protectors and said she worried they may not have realized their best option is to remain silent and contact a lawyer. This is not the first time the JTTF has been tied to an investigation of civil rights protesters. Records from Minnesota suggested that the taskforce monitored a Black Lives Matter demonstration. For indigenous leaders who have vowed to continue fighting the pipeline on the ground, the FBI investigations and ongoing federal prosecutions have become increasingly worrisome.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which has long opposed the part of the project near its home, has promised a legal fight. It didn't immediately respond to CNN's request Wednesday for comment. Trump executive action Read More Just a few weeks ago, President Donald Trump signed executive actions to advance approval of this pipeline and others, casting aside efforts by President Barack Obama's administration to block construction. Acting Secretary of the Army Robert Speer's moves to grant the easement and stop the preparation of an environmental impact statement were anticipated. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe said Tuesday the Obama administration had determined other locations for the pipeline should be looked into by the Army. The Standing Rock Sioux said they will argue in court that the environmental impact statement process was wrongfully terminated.

The decision gives the pipeline's developer -- Dakota Access, a subsidiary of Energy Transfer Partners -- right-of-way through government land at Lake Oahe Dam and Reservoir in North Dakota. The tribe has been concerned that digging the pipeline under Lake Oahe -- a section of the Missouri River in North Dakota -- would affect the area's drinking water, as well as the supply for 17 million people living downstream. The proposed underground route at Lake Oahe is half a mile upstream from the tribe's reservation. The sacred land at the center of the Dakota pipeline dispute The tribe and its allies have protested in North Dakota for months, blocking the path of the pipeline during peaceful demonstrations and clashes that have sometimes turned violent. Greenpeace said the President was looking out for the rich. The pipeline will stretch 1,172 miles through four states -- from North Dakota into South Dakota, winding through Iowa and ending in southern Illinois -- moving 470,000 barrels of crude oil a day across the Midwest. It is completed, except for the contested portion under Lake Oahe. Not all the Standing Rock Sioux are protesting the pipeline Like Dakota Access, the Keystone XL Pipeline had been the subject of environmental concern from activists, residents and indigenous tribes who worried that the pipeline would pollute as many as 2,500 aquifers. But pipeline supporters touted the jobs it would create and other economic benefits. In November 2015, Obama nixed the proposed pipeline, virtually ending the fight over the project that had gone on for much of his presidency. But Trump's executive actions on both pipelines signal how his administration will take a different approach to energy and environmental issues.

North Dakota is still processing those bills. That state expects an official tally of costs from the protests in July, said Cecily Fong, spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. North Dakota must reimburse Nebraska and other states under the national Emergency Management Assistance Compact, which offers help during governor-declared emergencies and disasters. The federal government provided no financial support for the response, Fong said. More than 1,800 government personnel responded to the protests, Fong said, including about 400 from other states. Protesters also left behind food, tents and other structures, and pits filled with human waste at their camps on Army Corps of Engineers land north of the Cannonball River during the winter, Fong said. Crews hauled away nearly 5,000 tons of trash. It's too early to tell whether Nebraska will experience similar protests should state regulators here approve construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, Kleeb said. The Nebraska Public Service Commission hosted a public hearing on the Keystone XL last week in York, and will hold at least one more hearing, in August, before reaching a decision as soon as Sept. 14. If approved, pipeline builder TransCanada expects the Keystone XL to be completed within two to three years. Bryan Tuma, assistant director of the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, said this state is monitoring the Keystone XL controversy as it unfolds and will request help from other states if necessary.

The Lakota Sioux people and their guests from around the globe built a veritable small city at Oceti Sakowin Camp in order to hold ground at Standing Rock, and now that the harsh North Dakota winter is settling in, they could be left with a bigger fight and fewer resources to fight it if the battle continues.

This is big-government decision-making at its worst. I look forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us. The short-term victory against the pipeline effort was won by putting bodies on the line to occupy territory. The unintended consequence of celebration could be that those bodies become a scarce resource. When the North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple announced, falsely, that Standing Rock would be forced to evacuate, reinforcements still came. Now, many of the Lakota Sioux and the Standing Rock resistance allies believe that all of the fanfare around the declared victory will just be another attempted deterrent, but this time using the illusion of success to convince the Sioux that their job is done, and that they can head home.

Vicki Anderson Granado, a spokeswoman for Energy Transfer Partners, the main developer behind the Dakota Access Pipeline, said the company doesn't comment on pending litigation. Dakota Access was still in the process of being served with the complaint, which means the legal answer will be due in about three weeks. The lawsuit is not the first time North Dakota landowners have complained about how land agents representing Dakota Access have treated them. Concerns also were raised to the North Dakota Public Service Commission when the pipeline was under review, with some landowners complaining about bullying tactics and threats of taking their land through eminent domain.

This has been happening for hundreds of years. Both are true. The scope of the resistance at Standing Rock exceeds just about every protest in Native American history. But that history itself, of indigenous people fighting to protect not just their land, but the land, is centuries old. Over the weekend, the situation at Standing Rock grew more contentious. On Sunday night, Morton County police sprayed the crowd of about 400 people with tear gas and water as temperatures dipped below freezing. Still, the broad strokes of each land infringement and each resistance stay essentially the same. In that tradition, the tribes gathered at Standing Rock today are trying to stop a natural gas pipeline operator from bulldozing what they say are sacred sites to construct an 1,172-mile oil pipeline. The tribes also want to protect the Missouri River, the primary water source for the Standing Rock Reservation, from a potential pipeline leak. Since April, when citizens of the Standing Rock Sioux Nation set up the Sacred Stone Camp, thousands of people have passed through and pledged support. Environmentalists and activist groups like Black Lives Matter and Code Pink have also stepped in as allies. Many people who have visited say that the camp is beyond anything they've ever experienced.

In 2015, when the Keystone XL pipeline was being debated, numerous Native American tribes and the Indigenous Environmental Network organized against it. The pipeline would have stretched 1,179 miles from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Also joining in were the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Resources Defense Council, and the Omaha, Dene, Ho-chunk, and Creek Nations, whose lands the pipeline would have traversed. President Obama vetoed Keystone XL. But even at the time, A. Gay Kingman, the executive director of the Great Plains Tribal Chairman's Association, warned that the reprieve would be temporary. In the case of the Dakota Access Pipeline, the Standing Rock Sioux have been able to attract support from hundreds of tribes all over the country, not just in places that would be directly affected. The tribes aren't just leaning on long-held beliefs about the importance of the natural world. They're also using long-held resistance strategies. Like the encampment itself. In the late 1800s more than 10,000 members of the Lakota Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes set up camp to resist the U.S. Army's attempt to displace them in search of gold. That camp took form at the Little Bighorn River in Montana. After the soldiers attacked the camp in June of 1876, the Battle of the Little Bighorn, widely known as (Gen. George) Custer's Last Stand, erupted. In defeating the Army, the tribes won a huge land rights victory for Native Americans. Enlarge this image Native American women demonstrate in 1973 on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, where roughly 200 American Indians occupied the town of Wounded Knee for the rights of indigenous people. Over the course of the 1973 occupation, two Sioux men were killed and hundreds more arrested. But the resistance, which lasted 71 days, underscored Native American civil rights issues in a way that many see reflected today in Standing Rock. If Native American resistance is an old story, that's because the systemic violation of indigenous land rights is an old story. And if history is any precedent, the resistance won't end at Standing Rock.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds. Demonstrators gather at a rally on June 29 at the Wisconsin-Minnesota border. (CNN)Environmental and Native American groups in Minnesota are gearing up to thwart the replacement of an aging pipeline that crosses the state. The Minnesota pipeline at the center of this latest battle is a replacement for an existing pipeline called Line 3. Built in the 1960s, Line 3 transports crude oil 1,097 miles from Edmonton, Alberta, across northern Minnesota to Superior, Wisconsin. Tribal and environmental groups opposed to the proposed Enbridge Line 3 project rally in September 2017 at the State Capitol in St. Paul, Minnesota. The company that operates the pipeline, Enbridge Energy, says the old pipeline needs to be replaced for safety reasons. In late June, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) unanimously approved the pipeline proposal. Enbridge said it has reduced the amount of oil flowing through the pipeline because of corrosion and other defects in the decades-old pipe. The replacement will allow them to transport more oil and address the safety concerns, the company said. A fight to protect resources Native American and environmental groups are concerned about the new pipeline's potential impact. Looking back on the stand at Standing Rock Paulson, who traveled to fight the DAPL and support the Standing Rock Sioux, says the proposed new pipeline crosses wild rice beds that are part of the creation story of his people. Not a done deal Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes said the Line 3 replacement proposal has prioritized Native American concerns from the start. Despite the MPUC's ruling that the pipeline is necessary, the Line 3 replacement is far from a done deal. Joseph Plumer, attorney for White Earth and the Red Lake bands of the Ojibwe tribe, talks about possible legal measures available to stop Line 3 on June 28 in St. Paul, Minnesota. Enbridge still must apply for 29 required federal, state, and local permits before they can begin construction, which could take months, a point that Minnesota Gov.

Opponents skirmished with law officers late Sunday and early Monday. Also gathering are law enforcement officers from the county, state and federal levels, who are patrolling the encampments surrounding the construction site. They have a job, too: to keep the peace. In a perfect scenario, these two goals would not be at odds with each other. The indigenous community and its allies would assemble and be heard, and the police would protect their right to do so. Rather than having their rights protected, peaceful protesters are being confronted and treated as if they are violent criminals. There is a difference between law enforcement reasonably protecting the public and confronting a group of people, including children, while outfitted in gear that would be more appropriate on a battlefield. Our observers saw lines of heavily armed officers and massive, military-grade vehicles when they traveled to the area. We have sent several letters to authorities expressing concern about the policing practices there, most recently when police sprayed a chemical irritant at close range at people standing in water while attempting to cross a creek near the construction site. Contrast this approach to what our teams saw at the presidential conventions this summer. While both Cleveland and Philadelphia deployed a massive amount of law enforcement, the authorities largely managed to exercise restraint without the kind of firepower we are seeing in North Dakota. Arrests at the conventions, when they did occur, were done in an orderly fashion, sometimes with officers even helping people over a fence before methodically and calmly arresting them. If only that were true. Sadly, the response to the people of the Standing Rock Sioux, like those in Ferguson and Baltimore, shows otherwise. The tendency to silence the voices of communities of color, including indigenous people, has long and shameful roots. Treating protesters as if they were enemies in combat unnecessarily escalates tensions and has a chilling effect on free expression. This is exactly the opposite of an effective police response, and one that we have seen used all too often against those whose viewpoints have been historically marginalized. Police should do their best to empower people to peacefully exercise their right to free speech. In any large gathering, there is always the chance that a small minority will seek to escalate a peaceful assembly into a violent confrontation. But it should not be assumed at the outset that a particular group as a whole will resort to violence. Not only do these tactics endanger more people than they protect, they are discriminatory when used to silence an entire community. Peaceful dissent is not a criminal act. Everyone in the United States should have the full enjoyment of their rights. No exceptions. All communities have a right to be heard. We reject the idea that any voice should be stifled. This can be removed when origin is fixed.

Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said he expects the Trump administration will rescind the environmental impact statement process and issue an easement for the Lake Oahe crossing. Cramer said he is hopeful Trump will take action on Dakota Access next week or shortly thereafter. The notice from the Army said it is accepting comments on the scope of the environmental impact statement through Feb. 20. The Army also said it will hold public scoping meetings that will be publicized at least 15 days in advance. Standing Rock leaders said the EIS should be more broad than currently proposed and should include the territory of the entire Great Sioux Nation, not just Lake Oahe and the northern border of the reservation. Comments will be accepted through Feb. 20. Vacation photographs often capture perfect moments in favorite places.

Imagine if you will an oil and gas pipeline company whose workers move into Army Corps of Engineers land in the middle of summer and establish an illegal campsite. Imagine next that said oil and gas pipeline company then sends out a nationwide call to action inviting non-employees from all parts of the country to join its employees at the campsite. Imagine that, over the next several months, thousands of such outsiders come and go to and from the illegal site, leaving behind piles of trash, large volumes of human waste, and dozens of abandoned cars, commercial vans, buses and trucks, many of which are broken down or out of gasoline. Next, imagine that said oil and gas pipeline company's management gets a little antsy about the situation around December, worried that the campsite in fact sits smack dab in the middle of a flood plain, a flood plain that drains into a nearby lake which serves as the drinking water supply for several Indian tribes and surrounding communities. Imagine that management understands that, when the spring thaws begin to come around the first of March, the resulting flood waters will carry whatever garbage, human waste and abandoned cars remain at the site right down into that nearby lake, thus polluting the drinking water for those surrounding communities. Now, imagine that several hundred of those outsiders choose to ignore the requests by management to leave, and instead stick around causing trouble and interfering with cleanup efforts until mid-February. Imagine that the oil and gas pipeline company refuses to clean up its own mess, and leaves that job to the Army Corps of Engineers. Imagine that, as the cleanup efforts finally begin, the weather suddenly becomes unseasonably warm, causing much of the snow and ice to begin to melt, turning the campsite into an ugly, muddy quagmire. Now, imagine the uproar that would be taking place in the national news media had an oil and gas pipeline company caused such a situation to exist. And imagine the legal hell that would rain down upon said oil and gas pipeline company in the form of fines, civil penalties and even criminal penalties from a multitude of local, state and federal government agencies in such a situation, especially if the site is not ultimately cleaned out before the spring floods begin in earnest. I am of course describing the current dire situation that exists at the protest site of the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the series of events that have led up to it. There is of course no national media uproar condemning the protesters who have created the current mess, or the conflict groups that helped to organize them, raised millions as a result of the conflict, but are contributing nothing to the cleanup. Nor is there any negative media mention of the dozens of celebrities who have visited the site to get a little free publicity over the last several months, or drawn attention to themselves by supporting the cause on social media, but who also are doing nothing to help with the clean up effort. Abandoned property used by people who temporarily occupied the Oceti Sakowin camp to protest the Dakota Access pipeline is piled in front of Dumpsters headed to the landfill. A massive cleanup is intended to prepare for possible spring flooding and prevent contamination. No mention of all the arrests of out-of-staters, or of the massive cost to Morton County. National media outlets have tended to portray these protesters - many of whom are professionals - as a peaceful and spiritual bunch. Local officials have been stunned by the hateful nature of the protesters and their supporters, who have deluged the county's phone lines with death threats. The local news media outlets - most notably the local Fox affiliate, KFYR, and Rob Port, a columnist for the Forum News Service who has done yeoman's work at the SayAnythingBlog - have been much more on top of the story, and willing to publish films and photos of the camp's real condition.

About 2,000 people remain in the camp, down from the nearly 5,000 who were there when the Army Corps announcement came. They are determined to keep their voices heard and stand guard as the political winds shift even stronger against them. They spoke of a resolve to stick together, to take care of each other, to remain vigilant until the fight is truly won. Despite the Army Corps' order for an environmental impact statement that could take months and may end in a reroute of the pipeline, Donald Trump has said when he takes office, he will ensure the pipeline gets built.

Tepees rely on firewood to stay warm but forests are hundreds of miles away. Historically, plains Indians sought refuge in wooded lowlands along rivers with an ample supply of firewood and shelter from the wind.

Trump campaigned on promises to increase domestic energy industry production and before taking office indicated he supported completion of the Dakota pipeline and revival of the Keystone XL project. In a statement, the Standing Rock Sioux said they would fight the decision. Trump also signed an action to expedite environmental review and approval of high-priority infrastructure projects that he hopes to get moving as part of his drive to rebuild U.S. airports, roads and bridges. The company has complied with all federal and state requirements and should be allowed to complete the project. Environmental activists broadly opposed the Keystone XL pipeline and campaigned against it for more than seven years. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in January said it would begin an environmental assessment that could delay the Dakota project further. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe won a key victory when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in early December turned down Energy Transfer Partners' request for an easement to tunnel under the nearby Missouri River. Standing Rock officials were not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. Shares of ETP, the company building the 450,000 barrel-a-day Dakota line, rose 3.5 percent in U.S. trading. Oil producers in North Dakota's Bakken region would likely benefit from the ability to move oil more quickly to the U.S. Gulf Coast by way of the 1,172-mile pipeline. The North Dakota Petroleum Council, the trade group for the state's oil producers who are relying on Dakota Access to expand their crude transport options, cheered Trump's order. Most of the Dakota pipeline was completed by the summer of 2016, except for a small section under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that forms part of the river. Trump on Monday met with leaders of labor unions, including the Building and Construction trades group and the Laborers International Union of North America, who have been vocal supporters of both pipeline projects. Both groups had endorsed Trump rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. election, but disagreed with her opposition to the Keystone pipeline. U.S. Energy Secretary nominee Rick Perry was until recently on ETP's board. Former President Barack Obama rejected Transcanada Corp's Keystone XL oil pipeline, which would bring Canadian crude from Alberta into the U.S. Gulf, in 2015 after environmentalists campaigned against the project for more than seven years. Transcanada did not immediate respond to a request for comment. Transcanada shares last traded up 2.4 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Check back for updates to this developing story.

Days after pipeline workers resumed drilling across the Missouri river, which provides drinking water to the tribe and flows a short distance from his house, Archambault explained why he has urged demonstrators to go home. Miles away, activists were doing the very opposite: organizing supplies, building new camps and vowing to stay in place until the pipeline is defeated. The past is present, Archambault explained, and the government stole more than just land. His grandmother was beaten for speaking her native language, so she did not pass it on to her children, he said, and youth were threatened with jail if they were caught practicing their religion. The chairman also recounted how his uncles were involved in the grassroots American Indian Movement and were attacked by the FBI.

MIKE MCCLEARY,TRIBUNE Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save After months of protests near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, the U.S. Army announced Sunday it would not approve an easement to allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to cross under the Lake Oahe section of the Missouri River. Among the considerations would be more information on the alternative routes, including the one crossing north of Bismarck, details on potential spills and impact on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's water intake and the extent of the tribe's treaty rights in Lake Oahe. Darcy indicated the corps' prior reviews and actions had complied with legal requirements, but this case required more analysis. The corps' decision followed several months of protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, along with members of Native American tribes from across the country and supporters from the environmental movement. Since August, people have camped along the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and staged protests at pipeline construction sites and in the Bismarck-Mandan area. The company has said the pipeline is a safer and more efficient method of moving oil from the Bakken than trucks and trains used now. In a statement Sunday afternoon, Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II thanked the Obama administration and all of the groups that have supported the months-long protest. Archambault said he hoped Kelcy Warren, CEO of pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners, Gov. Jack Dalrymple and the incoming Trump administration would respect the corps' decision. Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with Indigenous Environmental Network, could hardly contain his smile in a video posted to his Facebook page Sunday afternoon. Reaction from state politicians was swift and critical. The state politicians also quickly noted that the Trump administration could put any decision on the easement in question. Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., and Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., criticized the decision and said it could jeopardize future infrastructure projects. Hoeven also renewed his call to the federal government to provide additional funding and law enforcement to back up local efforts. Morton County law enforcement took steps to de-escalate tensions Sunday afternoon by relocating farther away from protesters north of the Backwater Bridge, a move announced before the corps decision became public. The move requires protesters to follow certain conditions, including staying off the bridge. Forum News Service contributed to this report.

This is in keeping with a legacy connected to genocide that began 500 years ago against the Indigenous of this hemisphere. The destructive and murderous train set in motion centuries ago continues to run, this time with Judge Boasberg as conductor and his Oct. 11 ruling that the Dakota Access Pipeline could continue to pump oil pending an environmental review by the Army Corps of Engineers. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the Corps in July, 2016 contending that the pipeline destroyed sacred Indigenous sites and threatens the water quality of the Standing Rock Reservation that sits only a half-mile or less from where the pipeline crosses the Missouri River in North Dakota. The Tribe has consistently filed motions to stop the flow of oil while litigation is ongoing. In the latest round of courtroom battles DAPL claimed that a pipeline shutdown would cause a major economic downturn. It was originally anticipated that the study would be completed by December, 2017. The Justice Department indicated it would take longer than expected to obtain spill modeling information from Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the Texas-based developer that owns DAPL. Obviously, ETP is in no hurry to provide that information. The longer the process, the more this works in favor of the oil company. The Corps now anticipates that the review and analysis will not be completed until April 2, 2018. What a windfall for ETP, as it will rake in millions of dollars in the meantime from the deadly pipeline. How convenient for DAPL when the judge chimed in a few days later, on Oct. 11, and confirmed that the oil can flow in the meantime. Consistently, Boasberg remains in the ideological hip pocket of the rapacious oil industry. To recount this sordid trajectory of judicial misfeasance keep in mind that in June , 2017 Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that the initial approval of DAPL failed to adequately consider its environmental consequences. The court ruled that the Army Corps had not fully complied with the environmental review laws before issuing permits to cross the Missouri River. It was expected that the judge would reach a decision sometime in September. Boasberg, who has been noted for stalling in this case, issued another determination on Oct. 11, agreeing with Energy Transfer Partners, that the pipeline should remain in operation and that the oil should continue to flow. From a legal perspective, standard procedure is that in such an operation the flow of oil would be stopped by the court pending the additional environmental analysis. But, lickspittle, bootlicking Boasberg has turned the system upside down in order to wallow in the slimy muck of injustice with Big Oil. Never mind that this is environmental disaster for the Indigenous of Standing Rock, never mind that the health problems of the Standing Rock Sioux will only be perilously exacerbated by the infamous pipeline as Boasberg carries on the work of the oil profiteers. Oil will continue to flow if this rogue jurist has his way. And they want it with tribal input. Or will he simply wait until April with his characteristic foot-dragging deliberation.

However, at Standing Rock in North Dakota, Indians from all over North America have been protesting for seven months in some ways never before seen. Protest in this case is related to process. Part of the process was for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the agency that approved the pipeline, to consult with tribes about how the pipeline would affect their reservations and treaty lands, sacred sites and cultural areas. According to documents filed in federal court, the Corps did just that numerous times. In response, officials adjusted the pipeline route. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe chose not to fully engage with pipeline officials until late in the process. The legal and ethical argument is about tribal sovereignty and the protection of natural resources. There is nothing new about such issues. However, what is novel is that the tribe and the outside protesters are working together. The Standing Rock reservation set up a protest camp and made a stand with the protesters. What also makes this Indian protest different from others is its manner and its reach. Theirs is a nonviolent protest that is speaking broadly, in such a way that non-Indians can see that these environmental and policy concerns affect them, too. An overwhelming number of them are women. This all stands in contrast to the American Indian Movement, which flourished in the early 1970s, culminating in the takeover of the Wounded Knee trading post on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and the shootout with federal agents nearby. That movement had few specific aims, a violent tendency and little non-Indian support. The Standing Rock protesters are making the argument that the pipeline threatens not just tribal land and resources but American land and resources. The protesters are making a stand on behalf of all Americans for better decisions for our energy future. This is their sacrifice and this is their new Thanksgiving gift. A non-Indian friend asked me recently, in response to protests about Indian mascots for sports teams, where is our Rev. We Indians are a plurality. There are more than 500 tribes in the United States and we all have different cultures, histories, landscapes and ways of organizing politically. We are united by the legacy, and current practices, of colonialism. Like African-Americans, we have fought for and won some of our civil rights. But we have always fought for something quite different from that, too. We have fought for the recognition that we are American and Indian, and that as Indians we belong to sovereign nations and have treaty rights that have always been our rights. We do not have, like the African-American civil rights movement, a single institution like slavery to define our struggle, and a hard date when that was to have ended. But the protest at Standing Rock does have something Dr. King possessed, and that is dignity in the face of dire opposition. We also have the same kind of ecclesiastical calling, a call from God or the spirits, to not only ennoble ourselves through protest but to ennoble the democratic republic that seeks to diminish us. There is something inside the protest to ponder. And it is grave. We have seen water protectors maced, arrested and fired upon with rubber bullets. David Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, wrote in The New York Times that this is proof that government, once again, is against us. That it is once again cowboys versus Indians. There is, of course, a history of conflict. This is ever more clear in the violent backlash against protesters in recent days. But to say that the story of the Dakota Access Pipeline is another iteration of that old western story is to repeat the mistakes of past protests and movements. We situate ourselves in a position of powerlessness. It absolves us of our own complicity in how the world of power around us has been shaped. It absolves our tribal leaders of their reluctance to show up for meetings and to fight diligently and thanklessly in the trenches of numb process. We have to show up to get up. Neither is irony.

Over the last eight months, the protesters said they have been maced, shot with rubber bullets and kept in dog cages by police. Most recently, a demonstrator was seriously injured in an explosion protesters say was caused by police. Police, in turn, have blamed the protesters for the explosion. Since 2014, Energy Transfer Partners has been developing the route for the Dakota Access pipeline, which was originally directed through the Missouri River, just 10 miles north of Bismarck, North Dakota. After the Army Corps of Engineers determined that the environmental risk was too high and could potentially endanger critical drinking water sources, the route was re-evaluated. Despite resistance from tribal leaders, the pipeline was redirected away from Bismarck and instead routed through the Standing Rock Reservation. The Army Corps recently released a statement demanding the protesters leave their camp, located just north of the Cannonball River, by Dec. 5. In their statement, the Army Corps said that their request is aimed at protecting the general public from violent confrontations between protestors and law enforcement and from the harsh weather approaching. Sandy Tolan, journalist and professor at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, has made several trips to Standing Rock this fall and has recently returned to continue covering the protest. He said he is impressed by the passion fueling the Standing Rock Movement. All throughout the country, rallies and protests have been popping up in support of Standing Rock, including here in Los Angeles. On Sunday, there was a march in Washington, D.C., to bring to light anti-pipeline sentiments. Despite national support, Tolan said the presence of law enforcement in Standing Rock is distressing. Hundreds of officers come out in riot gear. The size of this pipeline is significant, especially when considering the environmental impact and the global contribution to climate change. The Dakota Access Pipeline, which is planned to go on line early in 2017, will carry anywhere from 470,000 to 570,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois, according to Energy Transfer Partner's website. Despite little talk on environmental issues at during the election, President-elect Donald Trump has been loud and clear about his position on pushing investment into fossil fuels. While he hasn't specified on whether or not he is in support of the the Dakota Access Pipeline, he laid out his intentions to move forward with the Keystone Pipeline in his 100 Day plan. Although Trump recently sold off his stock in Energy Transfer Partners, his previous financial relationship with the oil industry has many people concerned about what his presidency could mean for the development of the pipeline.

(Rob Wilson) Agents with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be the latest agency assisting Morton County Sheriff Department deputies to guard Dakota Access pipeline construction as it prepares to drill under the Missouri River. Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier announced the aid of CBP officers Monday following the most violent confrontation yet near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. One activist, Sophia Wilansky, 21, may face the amputation of her arm. The courts are taxed. The jail is burdened. The 34 local law enforcement officers are stressed. All this comes amid an increasingly loud public outcry against the militarized policing. Organized campaigns to contact the people and agencies responsible for sending officers and equipment to aid Morton County in the assaults on water protectors have in some cases been effective. The article has been published by media worldwide. He and his deputies were en route to Morton County when Gov. Steve Bullock raised concerns about the potential misuse of the interstate statute. The Emergency Management Assistance Compact obligates law enforcement around the country to fulfill requests for aid under any form of emergency or disaster. All that caused Sheriff Gootkin to change his mind. It was not an easy choice to make, Gootkin said. Then, he raised a question that has begun to rattle many communities across America lately. It really breaks my heart. He and his unit stood by Morton County officers for one week before pulling out and refusing to return. This week, the ACLU released the most comprehensive list of law enforcement participating in the conflict at Standing Rock, 75 agencies total, all believed to be operating under the EMAC agreement. Now it seems likely that the state will need to request even more money from its Emergency Commission. The governor has pressed the Obama administration for federal aid in responding to the escalating conflict. He has suggested the U.S. Marshal Service step in to evict thousands of protectors who have occupied U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land. But the Obama administration has refused to do that, opting to sit down with the Standing Rock Sioux and negotiate a solution. It is now suing the federal government and meanwhile continuing to advance the pipeline. With the absence of federal assistance, Morton County has had to rely on the EMAC and support from police agencies nationwide. But he also said his deputies would not be returning.

Earlier, officials had warned of a physical blockade, but the governor's office backed away from that. A spokeswoman from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe was not immediately available for comment. The 1,172-mile (1,885 km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, is mostly complete except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. Thousands of people are protesting at camps located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land, north of the Cannonball River in Cannon Ball, North Dakota.

The chief also reassured commissioners that Fargo officers have demonstrated great restraint with none having used pepper spray or fire hoses. Law enforcement at the protest site, which includes agencies from around the country, have been criticized for using both on protesters, many of them American Indians convinced the pipeline just north of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation will pollute the Missouri River and disturb sacred ground. Todd spoke to the commission but his report was requested by two commissioners. Commissioner John Strand, a member of the city's Native American Commission, has said he's concerned about respect for Indian culture. Commissioner Tony Gehrig said residents have asked him about the costs to local taxpayers. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday declined an application from Energy Transfer Partners for an easement to tunnel the Dakota Access Pipeline under the river near the reservation. Todd said he expects that would reduce tensions. Also at the commission meeting was Lt. Gov. Drew Wrigley and members of the Native American Commission, who later convened a forum to discuss their concerns. Mutual aid Todd, backed up by Mayor Tim Mahoney, said Fargo police have an obligation to come to the aid of other law enforcement agencies when asked, all the more so because it's the largest agency in the state. And Fargo has had to lean on other agencies for help during the chief's tenure in the past two years. Officers from outside agencies came to Fargo's aid when a large brawl broke out downtown, Todd said. They came after Officer Jason Moszer was killed in the line of duty in February and his colleagues needed time to mourn, the chief said, and again when his colleagues needed time off to attend the funeral. At one point, there were as many as 49 Fargo officers there in response to a major incident. The department had to move shifts and increase their duration to 12 hours to ensure the number of officers on Fargo's streets wasn't affected. Todd said when officers are sent to Morton County they are often accompanied by commanders, who ensure they behave responsibly and are deployed responsibly. He told commissioners that his department holds no official position on the pipeline, serving only to ensure the rule of law, that protesters have a right to protest and private property owners, including the pipeline company, have the right to their property. Gehrig expressed satisfaction that questions posed by residents have been answered, which is why the city is sending police to Morton County and if local taxpayers are on the hook. Strand said he is glad police respect the right to protest peacefully. Indians speak out Members of the Native American Commission, which has expressed solidarity with peaceful protesters, didn't speak at the City Commission meeting. They saved their discussion for their forum, which Wrigley also attended. Several at the forum spoke about the heartache Indians feel over the Dakota Access Pipeline connecting it to the long history of mistreatment by the United States government.

Advocates hailed the decision but cautioned that pipeline construction is still underway, with activists still working to prevent the controversial project. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals handed a win to conservation groups on July 27, declaring that the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had erred in granting approval to pipeline developers for part of the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP). The 3.6 mile segment in question cuts through the Jefferson National Forest and would run under the Appalachian Trail. Thacker rescinded permissions for pipeline-related activities within the publicly-owned forest and sent the issue back to both the Forest Service and BLM for further inspection. The suit was brought by a coalition of organizations, including the Sierra Club, Appalachian Voices, Wild Virginia, the Wilderness Society, Preserve Craig, and Save Monroe. Anti-pipeline activists in Virginia face fines for protesting on their own land Protestors have also been denied medical care and at least one may not have access to food and water. Activists greeted the ruling with applause. Other activists were less optimistic. In a statement to ThinkProgress Monday morning, the group Appalachians Against Pipelines cautioned against reporting that construction on the pipeline had halted and emphasized that no stop work order has been issued as of present. A spokesperson for the MVP downplayed the court decision but did not indicate what impact the ruling will have on the broader project. The MVP has generated controversy across the region, worrying environmentalists and residents alike. The pipeline is set to run 303 miles through West Virginia into Virginia, with the possibility of extending to North Carolina. Approximately 2 billion cubic feet of fracked natural gas are expected to pass daily through the pipeline. Both the MVP and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP) are expected to come into contact with around 1,000 water crossings in Virginia, according to a February report from the Natural Resources Defense Council and the environmental consulting firm Downstream Strategies. Doctors attempting to visit the women were denied access by law enforcement agents and the duo ultimately came down in response to fines imposed by a district judge. The U.S. Forest Service had prevented activists from attempting to supply her with sustenance and similarly denied doctors access to the protester when they attempted to visit her. Appalachians Against Pipelines hailed the protesters and credited them with much of the success opponents have seen in their efforts to halt the pipelines. While the MVP struggles in court, the ACP is moving ahead. The pipeline is expected to run 600 miles from West Virginia to North Carolina, passing through Virginia along the way."}, {"URL": "http://www.upworthy.com/meet-the-former-army-officer-who-rallied-thousands-of-veterans-to-standing-rock?g=3", "Timestamp": "20180918235645", "Sentences": "Meet the former Army officer who rallied thousands of veterans to Standing Rock."}, {"URL": "https://thinkprogress.org/the-water-protectors-defend-the-bayou-842d603721ae#.rsx2iab06", "Timestamp": "20180919004038", "Sentences": "Aviva Shen Jan 14, 2017, 3:20 pm SHARE Facebook Twitter Email SMS WhatsApp Share The Bayou Bridge Pipeline would cross the Atchafalaya Basin, a sensitive wetland already being degraded by old pipelines. But another clash is brewing over a related pipeline by the same company, 1500 miles away. This battle cry was greeted by hoots and cheers from the crowd gathered outside a public hearing Thursday to protest the proposed Bayou Bridge Pipeline. The Bayou Bridge Pipeline would form the tail end of the now infamous Dakota Access route. The Dakota Access Pipeline would carry crude oil from the North Dakota oilfields to an oil tank farm in Illinois, where it would then be transported to Nederland, Texas. A newly completed pipeline connects Nederland to Lake Charles, Louisiana. Advertisement The Bayou Bridge Pipeline would carry 480,000 barrels of oil per day a final 162 miles across the state to refineries and ports, through eight watersheds and long stretches of fragile wetlands. The hearing lasted five and a half hours, as speaker after speaker weighed in on how the pipeline would affect them. Ultimately, however, they estimate the pipeline will create just twelve permanent jobs. Opponents are pushing the Army Corps of Engineers to draft an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that will fully investigate both certain and possible effects on the environment. It is already suffering from swamp degradation and pollution buildup from dozens of other oil and gas pipelines, many of which are abandoned. Now it's apparently onto musical testimony. But that route is already causing immense damage to the basin, opponents pointed out. Advertisement Pipeline permits in the basin require companies to remove the dirt they dig out and replace it once the project is finished. A history of spills The Bayou Bridge builders argue pipelines are the safest way to transport crude oil that would otherwise use less efficient trains or trucks to get to refineries. But past pipelines have proven to be less airtight than the industry claims. A new report by the Bucket Brigade found that there were 144 pipeline accidents in 2016. Many reports also lacked clear information on exactly how much oil or gas was spilled. Bucket Brigade contends that the industry is underreporting the scope of many of these smaller spills. The report notes that the industry reported one spill in the Chandeleur Sound as 8.5 gallons. SkyTruth, a group that studies satellite imagery of oil sheens after accidents, estimated it was at least 116 gallons. Pipelines may become even more vulnerable, as more frequent storms and floods plague southern Louisiana. Older pipeline infrastructure has been compromised as the marshes lose ground. More than 600 Louisiana pipelines risk exposure over the next 25 years, according to a Louisiana State University study. A national movement Since Standing Rock protesters successfully halted construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline, efforts to stop more pipeline construction have ramped up across the country. Proposed oil infrastructure on the East Coast and in the Pacific Northwest are attracting more scrutiny in the wake of the Dakota protests. Activists in Texas have been arrested for blocking pipeline construction through Big Bend and the Rio Grande. Many of the Louisianans who attended the hearing had recently returned from the Standing Rock camp in North Dakota. Others expressed solidarity with the thousands of Florida water protectors expected to gather this weekend to oppose the Sabal Trail Pipeline.

Judge rejects Standing Rock request to block Dakota Access pipeline drilling Read more With snow falling, the Native Nations Rise march took off from the headquarters of the army corps of engineers, the federal agency that authorized construction of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access oil pipeline. The march wound through the capital and along the way demonstrators paused in front of the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue to erect a tipi. At the White House, protesters demonstrated, danced and prayed in what organizers say is a show of solidarity against the federal government that has a long history of discounting tribal concerns on a range of environmental, economic and social issues. The protesters, some dressed in traditional Native American clothing, snaked through the crowd carrying a black inflatable tube representing an oil pipeline. The Standing Rock protest against the Dakota Access pipeline became an international rallying cry for indigenous rights and climate change activism, drawing thousands of Native Americans to the rural area of Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Little Thunder, a traditional dancer and indigenous activist from the Lakota tribe, dances as he demonstrates in front of the White House. During the days leading up to the rally, Native American leaders and activists met with members of Congress to press them to protect tribal rights. Leaders also set up an encampment of tipis near the Washington monument and held cultural workshops. Work on the pipeline, which is owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, was halted in December by the Obama administration. The army corps of engineers announced that it would look at alternate routes for the pipeline and that it would undertake an environmental impact statement. But in January, Trump signed an executive order giving the pipeline project the go-ahead. The army corps granted an easement for the oil company to drill under a reservoir on the Missouri river that is adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and construction resumed in early February. The company has said it would be just a matter of weeks before up to 550,000 barrels of oil a day can begin flowing through the pipeline.

The Ramapough Lunaape tribe in the township of Mahwah, New Jersey are protesting the interstate Pilgrim Pipeline, a proposed 178-mile dual pipeline that would carry fracked Bakken shale oil from Albany, New York to the Bayway Refinery in Linden, New Jersey. While it is not yet finalized, the preliminary route crosses five counties and 30 municipalities in New Jersey and five counties and 25 municipalities in New York, as well as the Highlands region, where the groundwater and surface water are the direct source of water for more than 4.5 million people in both states, according to the Coalition Against Pilgrim Pipeline. The pipeline would also run through a portion of the Ramapo Valley Reservation. Similar to the Standing Rock Sioux, the Lunaape worry that a potential pipeline leak would pollute drinking water and sacred sites. The pipeline is capable of carrying 400,000 barrels of oil per day. The company, which announced the project three years ago, has not yet applied for the permit that would define their exact pipeline route. NBC New York reports that the Lunaape have displayed anti-Pilgrim pipeline signs alongside teepees that were initially erected to recognize the efforts of the Standing Rock Sioux, who are protesting the heavily contested Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. The tribe has been hosting teach-ins about the pipeline at their encampment. Dozens of people have already attended. The protest, however, has hit a legal snag as the tribe has not yet obtained the necessary permits to camp out on land near the pipeline's proposed route.

But it stops short of requiring the government to act on those suggestions, and tribal leaders and activists say their preferences have long gone ignored. He added that the report was spot on. In discussions with US officials, Tauli-Corpuz suggested strengthening the requirements for agencies to communicate with native tribes on decisions, and Anderson believes such a statutory fix is necessary. Previous UN rapporteurs have made similar recommendations to better acknowledge tribal rights, particularly pertaining to consultation. A final report will be presented at the UN Human Rights Council in September, and submitted to the State Department for distribution to other federal agencies. Submit it here.

The Post stated: If Ou had already been inside the U.S. border, law enforcement officers would have needed a warrant to search his smartphones to comply with a 2014 Supreme Court ruling. But the journalist learned the hard way that the same rules don't apply at the border, where the government claims the right to search electronic devices without a warrant or any suspicion of wrongdoing. ... Ou said he's unclear about why he was detained. Hugh Handeyside of the American Civil Liberties Union wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security expressing concerns over Ou's detention. 10:17 a.m. Federal officials said anyone found on the land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing. Musician Neil Young and his girlfriend, actor Daryl Hannah, posted a statement of support on Young's Facebook page: A few weeks ago we traveled to visit the Standing Rock Sioux In North Dakota. We arrived at this unprecedented historical gathering of over five hundred tribes and thousands of others standing on the front lines to protect water, to state the most basic human truth, to say water is life. Despite the painful history, today they fight peacefully for us all. ... All here together, with their non-native relatives, standing strong in the face of outrageous, unnecessary and violent aggression, on the part of militarized local and state law enforcement agencies and National Guard, who are seemingly acting to protect the interests of the Dakota Access Pipeline profiteers, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of tax-payer dollars, above all other expressed concerns. They stand against corporate security forces, the county sheriff and the National Guard. Standing while being hit with water cannons, mace, tear gas, rubber bullets. Standing without weapons and praying, the water protectors endure human rights abuses in sub freezing temperatures. Supplies arrive from all over as the social media universe shares the heartbreaking news to the world, that an American corporate media is not free to report. Thus, it is the ugliness of corporate America, seen around the world. PST Tuesday: In another disturbing update from Standing Rock, Reuters reports: North Dakota law enforcement will begin to block supplies from reaching protesters at a camp near the construction site of an oil pipeline project in an effort to force demonstrators to vacate the area, officials said on Tuesday. The order was effective immediately. As of Tuesday morning, however, no vehicles carrying supplies had been turned back, said Cecily Fong, a spokeswoman for the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services. 10:14 a.m. Archambault noted that the evacuation order, which the governor said he issued for the campers' well-being in the face of dangerous winter weather, came a week after police turned water hoses on protesters in sub-freezing temperatures. ... The governor did not specify how he intended to enforce his order other than by directing state and local agencies to refuse emergency assistance and other services to anyone who remained at the site. But Standing Rock Sioux spokeswoman Phyllis Young told a news conference Monday night the tribe would stand its ground. That is our camp. As Dalrymple noted, the weather is increasingly harsh. Many are gathered around fires for prayer and warmth. 2:06 p.m. PST Saturday: A critical new development in the situation in North Dakota unfolded late Friday when the Army Corps of Engineers ordered the abandonment of one of the main encampments at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The Army Corps, the main force behind the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, sent a letter to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, as NBC News reports: Citing increased violence between protesters and law enforcement and the increasingly harsh winter conditions, the Army Corps said it decided to close its land to the protesters who have been there since early April. This will shut down the Oceti Sakowin camp, which is one of the three camps located near the construction site. That's kind of supposed to already be all of America. 1:25 p.m. PST Friday: Thousands gathered at Standing Rock for peaceful prayer circles and demonstrations on Thanksgiving Day. After they crossed, protesters gathered in a prayer circle, marking the moment by holding hands and singing. She describes a humanizing scene, where despite the tension, police and protesters were able to converse without clashing. It was peaceful. The violent origins of Thanksgiving made yesterday's peaceful action all the more significant. 8:11 a.m. The jail is burdened. Monet also suggests that phone calls to authorities from supporters of the demonstrators are influencing authorities' decision-making. All this comes amid an increasingly loud public outcry against the militarized policing. Organized campaigns to contact the people and agencies responsible for sending officers and equipment to aid Morton County in the assaults on water protectors have in some cases been effective. The article has been published by media worldwide. He and his deputies were en route to Morton County when Gov. Steve Bullock raised concerns about the potential misuse of the interstate statute. The Emergency Management Assistance Compact obligates law enforcement around the country to fulfill requests for aid under any form of emergency or disaster. All that caused Sheriff Gootkin to change his mind. It was not an easy choice to make, Gootkin said. Then, he raised a question that has begun to rattle many communities across America lately. It really breaks my heart. Watch the full clip below (Aaron Murphy via Facebook): 11:49 a.m. PST Wednesday: Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., penned a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch earlier this week, imploring her to protect the demonstrators. It reads: Dear Attorney General Lynch, I am extremely concerned after hearing reports of dangerous clashes between police and protesters of the Dakota Access Pipeline project near Cannon Ball, ND. The reported use of water cannons for crowd control in sub-freezing temperatures is excessive and unnecessary, and I urge you to take action to protect the First Amendment rights ofprotestors, and the physical safety of all involved parties. Video of the incident appears to show that the water cannons were not simply being used for fire control, or even crowd control, but were often directed at small crowds or even individual protesters. Combined with the onset of wintry weather, water cannons are extremely dangerous and potentially lethal weapons, and I urge you to investigate their use on protesters. On November 14, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that additioual analysis of the Dakota Access Pipeline project is necessary and invited the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to engage due to potential impact of a pipeline leak on the Tribe's drinking water supply. Native American populations have struggled for decades under the complex burden of historical trauma, and I have witnessed and admired how these communities have turned to their cultural foundations to build strength against that burden. These tactics against protesters exercising their Constitutional rights threaten to add another layer of trauma to these communities. I urge you to do everything in your power to prevent further escalation of violence. Thank you for your attention to this matter. Fortune provides more information on Sunoco's acquisition of Energy Transfer Partners: Pipeline companies Sunoco Logistics Partners and Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), both of which are controlled by general partner Energy Transfer Equity, said on Monday they would combine in a corporate consolidation to cut borrowing and operating costs. The pipeline corporation will remain in the hands of Dallas billionaire Kelcy Warren. 6:32 p.m. PST Tuesday: A special gathering is slated to take place on Thursday at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The participants will honor and serve dinner to 500 Native American water protectors who have been demonstrating against the Dakota Access pipeline project. Truthdig will follow along as the Wopila Feast takes place. Watch for updates on Thursday. 2:42 p.m. PST Tuesday: The Standing Rock Medic & Healer Council has released new information about the condition of 21-year-old activist Sophia Wilansky, who was taken to the hospital and initially declared to be in critical condition after Sunday night's clash with law enforcement left her with a severely injured arm. Wilansky's father also provided a statement: A grenade exploded right as it hit Sophia in the left forearm taking most of the undersurface of her left arm with it. Both her radial and ulnar artery were completely destroyed. Her radius was shattered and a large piece of it is missing. Her medial nerve is missing a large section as well. All of the muscle and soft tissue between her elbow and wrist were blown away. The police did not do this by accident - it was an intentional act of throwing it directly at her. ... Sophia will have surgery again tomorrow as bit by bit they try to rebuild a somewhat functioning arm and hand. The first surgery took a vein from her leg which they have implanted in her arm to take the place of the missing arteries. She will need multiple surgeries to try to gain some functional use of the arm and hand. She will be, every day for the foreseeable future, fearful of losing her arm and hand. There are no words to describe the pain of watching my daughter cry and say she was sorry for the pain she caused me and my wife. I died a thousand deaths today and will continue to do so for quite some time. I am left without the right words to describe the anguish of watching her look at her now alien arm and hand. According to the list, currently, a total of 75 different law enforcement organizations have provided assistance to the Morton County Sheriff's Department. 11:02 a.m. ... Wilansky was evacuated and airlifted to a Minneapolis hospital. After hours of surgery, she posted on Facebook early this morning that her arm has not been amputated, but she will not know for another week whether amputation might be required. Wilansky is from New York City and has organized against the construction of pipelines, including the AIM Spectra pipeline, in New York and across the East Coast. Wilansky's father reportedly released images of her injury (warning: extremely graphic). According to the Standing Rock Medic & Healer Council, approximately 300 people were injured during Sunday's confrontation with law enforcement. In a statement issued on its Facebook page, the council wrote: These 300 injuries were the direct result of excessive force by police over the course of 10 hours. At least 26 seriously injured people had to be evacuated by ambulance to 3 area hospitals. Police continuously assaulted demonstrators with up to three water cannons for the first 7 hours of this incident in subfreezing temperatures dipping to 22F (-5.5C) causing hypothermia in the majority of patients treated. Chemical weapons in the form of pepper spray and tear gas were also used extensively, requiring chemical decontamination for nearly all patients treated and severe reactions in many. Projectiles in the form of tear gas canisters, rubber bullets, and concussion grenades led to numerous blunt force traumas including head wounds, lacerations, serious orthopedic injuries, eye trauma, and internal bleeding. Amnesty International is reportedly sending a fourth delegation to North Dakota in the wake of Sunday's violence, and the organization's U.S. executive director, Margaret Huangin, wrote a letter to the Morton County Sheriff's Department condemning police tactics. It is the legitimate right of people to peacefully express their opinion. Public assemblies should not be considered as the 'enemy'. Truthdig contributor Sonali Kolhatkar spoke with Nick Tilsen, executive director of Thunder Valley Community Development Corp. and a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe. Tilsen was present during Sunday night's confrontation. Water protectors, for nearly a month, have been held off from removing a barricade put in place for the protection of the Oceti Sakowin, Sacred Stone, and Rosebud encampments as threats of the Army Corps of Engineers and the Morton County Sheriffs clearing out camp mounted. People attempted to peacefully remove the barricade and were attacked for doing so. An elder went into cardiac arrest on the frontline. Many, many live videos show the opposite occurring. We call on them to TELL THE TRUTH. Secondly, we call on President Obama to create and sign an executive order that cancels the Dakota Access Pipeline like he did with the Keystone XL. We call on President Obama to not let Trump be the bad guy who handles this. We call on him to be the change he promised when he was campaigning to be President. We call on him to uphold his words of hope. 9:36 a.m. PST Monday: Truthdig correspondent Donald Kaufman reports on the clash between police and the water protectors. They are being trapped and attacked. According to Jade Begay, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network, 167 people were injured and seven were taken to the hospital. A spokesman for the sheriff's department said that law enforcement was spraying water because protesters were lighting fires on and around the bridge. 12:19 p.m. PST Thursday: Unicorn Riot has shared video footage of an arrest made in Bismarck, N.D., earlier Thursday: Police beat water protector in zip ties until bleeding from head, dislocate arm, then place bag over head as cops continue beating. Kaufman explains that Fallis' supporters allege that she was unjustly charged with attempted murder after police arrested her. Demonstrators in Mandan County today are demanding Red Fawn's release. Kaufman shared live video footage of the unfolding events: Scroll down to see more photos and videos of the demonstrations. 10:22 a.m. PST Thursday: Peaceful protesters gathered in Bismarck, N.D. early Thursday. Truthdig's Donald Kaufman is following the demonstrations and sending live updates. He also shared live video of the demonstrations on Truthdig's Facebook page: Scroll down to see more live updates embedded in the Evrybit story at the bottom of this page. It is the continuation of resistance to centuries of repression and oppression. Donald Kaufman wrote a firsthand account of what's happening on the ground at Standing Rock. 2:04 p.m. PST Wednesday: As today's demonstrations come to a close, take some time to learn more about the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's fight. Watch the short film below: 12:02 p.m. PST Wednesday: Donald Kaufman reports that Wednesday's action at the Bank of North Dakota has ended. For example, on Tuesday, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. made an appearance at one of the camps. 10:22 a.m. PST Wednesday: Peaceful protesters, determined to halt construction of the proposed Dakota Access pipeline, rallied outside the Bank of North Dakota in Bismarck on Wednesday morning. The protesters chose the bank because, they allege, it funds treaty violations against the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Sanders also criticized Trump's pro-fossil fuel position.

Phillips 66 owns a 40 percent interest in the joint venture, while Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics each have a 30 percent interest, according to a press release. The proposed Bayou Bridge route is an estimated 60 miles from Phillips 66 Paradis Pipeline Station. Protesters and residents tweeted their opposition to the Bayou Bridge. The Bayou Bridge is a segment of pipeline across Louisiana that will connect oil from Nederland, Texas to refineries in St. James, Parish. However, not everyone is celebrating. Residents and advocates have concerns about safety, the environmental impact of the pipeline, and its affect on people who make their living from the Bayou. The Times-Picayune's JR Ball wrote that people who live in Bayou Sorrel often hunt alligator, fish, and crab, for a living.

But the tide quickly turned after a Reuters report later in the day revealed that regulators found signs of diesel in a drilling fluid sample collected from a spill that happened near Energy Transfer's Rover gas pipeline construction project in Ohio this past April. Meanwhile, the presence of an undocumented substance in the drilling fluids gave several environmental groups more reason to urge The Army Corps of Engineers to step in and halt construction of the project. That's an ominous sign, considering these groups caused significant delays in completing the construction of the Dakota Access section of the Bakken Pipeline. Those issues on the Dakota Access Pipeline would come back to haunt the company later in the month, when a federal judge ruled that the Army Corps of Engineers didn't adequately consider the impacts of an oil spill under a key waterway in North Dakota. The judge ordered a new environmental analysis and said he'd consider stopping the flow of oil until the Army completed its review. While a subsequent ruling will allow the pipeline to continue transporting oil while the Army conducts the additional environmental review, the judge could still shut it down. If that were to happen, it would have a significant impact on Energy Transfers' future earnings, as well as impact partners like Phillips 66, which is banking on the oil and cash flow from the system. Now what June was a rough month for Energy Transfer Partners, which is facing legal battles on two of its largest pipeline projects. While a permanent halt to both systems is unlikely, the uncertainty surrounding a potentially lengthy delay weighed on the stock last month. So there's still plenty of headline risk, since an unfavorable outcome from any of its legal battles could cause another wave of selling. 10 stocks we like better than Energy Transfer Partners When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The Army Corps of Engineers agrees, and has said so publicly and in federal court filings. In spite of consistently stating at every turn that the permit for the crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe granted in July 2016, comported with all legal requirements, including the use of an environmental assessment, rather than an environmental impact statement, the Army Corps now seeks to engage in additional review and analysis of alternative locations for the pipeline. As stated all along, ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way. This statement should come as no surprise. Nothing in the Army Corps statement even hinted that the pipeline would not move forward, but the water protectors at Standing Rock have fought and bled to reach even this moment. If they had sat down while the U.S. government and its corporate cronies bulldozed through the blood and bones of their ancestors, they would not be fighting, living to see another day. I salute them. And I salute all who answered their call. Black people in the United States have been fighting these same white supremacist capitalist forces for centuries, but we still fight. We call a win a win even though we haven't won it all. Advertisement Because as I previously reported, this is not over. The Army Corps denied the easement that would have allowed construction to continue. Construction of the pipeline has desecrated sacred burial grounds and threatened the water safety of indigenous tribes and others who live further down the Missouri River. President Barack Obama (center) talks with Standing Rock Sioux Chairman David Archambault II (left) during the Cannon Ball Flag Day Celebration in Cannon Ball, N.D., on June 13, 2014. His statement reads in part: Today, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that it will not be granting the easement to cross Lake Oahe for the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline. Instead, the Corps will be undertaking an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternative routes. We wholeheartedly support the decision of the administration and commend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama, the Army Corps, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and all of Indian Country will be forever grateful to the Obama Administration for this historic decision. We want to thank everyone who played a role in advocating for this cause. We thank the tribal youth who initiated this movement. We thank the millions of people around the globe who expressed support for our cause. We thank the thousands of people who came to the camps to support us, and the tens of thousands who donated time, talent, and money to our efforts to stand against this pipeline in the name of protecting our water. We especially thank all of the other tribal nations and jurisdictions who stood in solidarity with us, and we stand ready to stand with you if and when your people are in need. Treaties are paramount law and must be respected, and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward. We are not opposed to energy independence, economic development, or national security concerns but we must ensure that these decisions are made with the considerations of our Indigenous peoples. On Friday, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that law enforcement had the full support of the Justice Department, without condemning the violence that water protectors have already faced at their hands. Lynch also suggested that more assistance would be deployed, without specifying what that assistance would look like. As previously reported by The Root, thousands of veterans have traveled to Standing Rock to stand in solidarity. The decision today by the Obama Administration to further postpone any action on the easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline is a serious mistake. It does nothing to resolve the issue, and worst of all it prolongs the serious problems faced by North Dakota law enforcement as they try to maintain public safety. Senator Hoeven, Congressman Cramer and I have repeatedly asked for the easement to be granted and for the pipeline crossing to move forward so that the federal government can bring this to a conclusion. But the Army Corps' decision is a victory that speaks to the unwavering spirit of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. They refused to be silenced and they refused to be moved. And they made the entire world pay attention.

People on horseback canter by and thousands of colourful flags flutter in the prairie wind. There are sturdy wooden buildings now, Mongolian yurts, and wall tents with wood stoves and even a geodesic dome where meetings and spiritual instruction take place. The Standing Rock Sioux nation, whose territory is all around here, are leading this action and their elders set the tone. Newcomers are welcome but they have to take an orientation course where they learn about non-violence, the ways of the Sioux, and the sacred camp fires around the grounds that must be respected, never photographed or allowed to go out. One of those was going on as we wandered the camp, mostly trying to keep warm in the blowing snow and icy winds. A ring of people stood in open ground and two instructors, from Hawaii and Alaska, showed them how to avoid violent confrontation during protest actions while still holding their ground and standing firm for their beliefs. It's helpful advice. More than 500 demonstrators have been arrested since the camp began last summer. Among them are celebrities, journalists and many Native American activists. North Dakota newspapers have reported the local court system is being strained beyond its capacity by all the trials and arraignments, which usually seem to end in a dismissal or reduction of charges. There have been ugly confrontations and both sides blame each other. In the early days of the protest, last September, there were reports of vandalism and deliberately set fires, but lately much of the violence seems to have come from the authorities. In late November, a group of protesters trying to cross a bridge blockaded by police just outside the camp faced water cannon and tear gas.

Energy Transfer Partners, which owns and operates the pipeline, did not respond to a request for comment before publication. A representative for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers could not be reached. The Dakota Access pipeline runs 1,100 miles across much of the Great Plains, connecting the Bakken oil formation in North Dakota to a refinery and second pipeline in Illinois.

First, he said, the Standing Rock Sioux are assured certain hunting and fishing rights in their most recent treaty with the U.S. government. This emphasis on consideration points to the broader nature of the legal fight: This case is not about how the pipeline may harm Standing Rock, but whether the Corps adequately studied and reported on those harms before approving it in the first place. According to federal regulation, every major project constructed near a poor community, community of color, or Native American reservation must be studied on environmental-justice grounds. The Corps shrugged off many of these rules, arguing that no affected group lived within a half-mile of the pipeline route. The Corps was technically correct. The Dakota Access pipeline runs 0.55 miles north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. The judge ruled that the Corps did not violate administrative law when it quickly approved the pipeline earlier this year. The complicated legal history of the Dakota Access pipeline has stemmed from one important conflict: The pipeline mostly runs across private land, allowing Energy Transfer Partners to quickly secure permission and construct most of it last year. But it also must cross the Missouri River, a federal waterway controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Therefore the dispute at Standing Rock has played out over the last year as the vast majority of the pipeline stood completed and ready for operation. But less than two months later, in early September, the Obama administration stepped in and asked Energy Transfer Partners to voluntarily stop work on the project. President Barack Obama revoked the permit entirely in early December 2016 at the end of that review. His administration also ordered Energy Transfer Partners and the U.S. Army Corps to study whether the pipeline could be re-routed. That study did not last long. The president celebrated the pipeline during a speech last week in Cincinnati. But I took none, actually none. Hasselman referenced the speech as he spoke to me Wednesday.

The federal government has been taking land from Lakota and Dakota people for 150 years, tribal leaders say, from the seizure of land in the Black Hills of South Dakota after the discovery of gold in the 1870s to the construction of dams in the Missouri River that flooded villages, timberland and farmland in the Dakotas in the 1950s. Through the ages, the warring tribes of the Northern Plains lived, hunted and fought across a sprawling expanse of land. Many were migratory, moving with the seasons. Each treaty with the U.S. government, most notably the 1851 and 1868 treaties of Fort Laramie, restricted their movement further, although they left them large areas west of the Missouri River and recognized them as sovereign nations. In freezing temperatures, police used water cannons on protesters just north of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota Nov. 20. Land was later taken to make way for homesteading. In 1889, Congress passed legislation that created the modern reservation system, pushing the Sioux, also known as Lakota, into smaller areas. And later in the 1900s, a series of dams across the Missouri River rolled back the scope of those reservations, too. Lake Oahe illustrates his point. The lake, the site of the current dispute, exists because of a dam project built by the Army Corps of Engineers, the same agency that has been weighing whether and where the Dakota Access pipeline could be built. Empowered by the Flood Control Act of 1944, the Army Corps erected the Oahe Dam in central South Dakota, forming a reservoir that extends about 250 miles upstream to within a short distance of Bismarck, N.D. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy dedicated the dam, hailing it as a symbol of a free society tapping its natural resources. It buried them. Caption An encampment has grown near the work site, where security guards face off with demonstrators. The Army Corps simply condemned the land and paid little to no compensation. After building the dam, the Army Corps seized strips of land on either side of the river. Those strips are the areas in dispute now, giving the Army Corps a central role in letting Energy Transfer Partners complete the line, or not. The pipeline battles of the past three months have taken place near the Cannonball. The Standing Rock Sioux are not alone in harboring old grievances, many involving the Army Corps and its dams, Sachse says. The Kinzua Dam in Pennsylvania on the Allegheny River, built in the 1960s, forced more than 600 Seneca families to leave their homes and submerged 10,000 acres of ancestral land. Indians say the project, built by the Army Corps, broke a 1794 treaty signed by President George Washington. The Colville Confederated Tribes sued the government over the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state, which blocked salmon fishing sites the tribes had used for centuries. In Minnesota this year, the Prairie Island Indian Community bought 112 acres of agricultural land near St. Paul to secure a future home. On its reservation, about 30 miles southeast of the Twin Cities, the tribe has wrestled with flooding from the Mississippi and Vermillion rivers. The reservation has about 3,100 acres of land held in trust by the U.S. government. Located in the 100-year floodplain, the land is unusable for development. Native American disputes are not just history; they are still alive. But the Sioux rejected the money and continue to seek the return of the land. Energy Transfer Partners did not advance its cause when its chief executive, Kelcy Warren, said in an interview on PBS that he wished the tribe had consulted with the company earlier. Nor did Julie Fedorchak, the North Dakota Public Service Commission chair, who told NPR that the Standing Rock Sioux failed to take part in the 11-month permit process or in 30 hours of open hearings, and that their efforts to reach chairman Archambault were futile. Archambault said in an interview with The Washington Post that the tribal council had in fact met with Energy Transfer executives at the tribal headquarters in September 2014 and that the tribal leaders had clearly stated their opposition to the pipeline. Shale oil produced by fracking in western North Dakota is the main source of crude for the Dakota Access pipeline project. Energy Transfer Partners, which on Monday announced a merger with Sunoco in an exchange of shares, had once hoped to keep the Dakota Access pipeline out of the limelight. A natural gas pipeline lies along a similar route. And railroads pose similar hazards. This pipeline, the company says, is just one of hundreds of pipelines that carry crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products across the country. The Standing Rock Sioux have raised concerns about a possible pipeline leak in the Missouri River; other pipelines have leaked into rivers over the past five years, including some relatively new ones. The pipeline, he says, is made of extra-thick steel and will run 90 to 115 feet below the bottom of Lake Oahe. But the Native American opposition to the pipeline project runs much deeper than that.

Photo by Dan Bacher. original image (5184x3456) Over 500 people in Sacramento stand in solidarity with Standing Rock Sioux by Dan Bacher Over 500 Sacramento area residents, including Native Americans, social justice advocates and environmentalists, joined tens of thousands of others throughout the world on November 15 to demand that the Obama administration and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers halt the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). They lined both sides of the street in front of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers office on J Street, proclaiming their solidarity with the struggle of Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota and their allies to stop the pipeline that carries fracked crude Bakken oil. Many drivers passing by on the busy street honked their horns in support of the protesters. The protest took place the day after the Corps announced it is delaying an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline project until it conducts further environmental review and discussion with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Brown noted that the Corps approved the construction pipeline without proper consultation or adequate environmental studies. Cosponsors of the local action included Sacramento Area Friends and Relatives of the Lakota Nation, Sacramento Climate Coalition, 350 Sacramento, Davis MoveOn, Davis Stands with Standing Rock, Raging Grannies of Sacramento, Sacramento Stands with Standing Rock, Alianza, and Jewish Voice for Peace. Before the end of the protest, Carol Standing Elk, Lakota Sioux, met with a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers representative, Tyler Stalker, and several men from the agency inside the office. Energy Transfer Partners is building the 1,200-mile pipeline to carry fracked crude oil from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota. In a classic case of environmental racism, early plans proposed routing the pipeline close to the city of Bismark, a largely white community. However, when the people there objected because of the danger to their water supply, the pipeline was rerouted near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The Army invites discussion of the risk of a spill in light of such conditions, and whether to grant an easement for the pipeline to cross Lake Oahe at the proposed location. The Army continues to welcome any input that the Tribe believes is relevant to the proposed pipeline crossing or the granting of an easement. While these discussions are ongoing, construction on or under Corps land bordering Lake Oahe cannot occur because the Army has not made a final decision on whether to grant an easement. The Army will work with the Tribe on a timeline that allows for robust discussion and analysis to be completed expeditiously. Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Chair Dave Archambault II said while the decision was not 100 percent what the Tribe had hoped for he said it is clear President Obama is listening. And for this, you have our deepest thanks and gratitude. The harmful and dehumanizing tactics by the state of North Dakota and corporate bullies did not go unnoticed because of you. The 1,100-mile pipeline was rerouted towards tribal nations after citizens of North Dakota rightfully rejected it to protect their communities and water. The water supply of the Tribe and 17 million Americans downstream are at risk for contamination by crude oil leaks and spills. A single spill would be culturally and economically catastrophic for the Tribe. The Missouri River is the longest river in North America and crosses several states south of the project.

When they filed the lawsuit last summer, the tribes argued that the pipeline threatened Native American cultural sites and their water supply. Their religion argument was new, however, and disputed by both the corps and the company. Boasberg said he was likely to allow the tribes to continue making the religion argument, though he did not think it was likely to succeed. Native Americans are planning four days of activities, including lobbying lawmakers and culminating in a march on the White House. Tribal members and supporters plan to camp each day on the National Mall, with tipis, a ceremonial fire, cultural workshops and speakers. Both tribes also have asked Boasberg to overturn the federal permission for the Lake Oahe crossing and to bar the corps from granting permission in the future. The pipeline saga has endured for months. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of pipeline opponents who sided with tribal opposition to the pipeline camped on federal land near the drill site for months, often clashing with police. There have been about 750 arrests in the region since August. Authorities last month closed the camp in advance of spring flooding season and set up roadblocks to prevent protesters from returning. Work under Lake Oahe had been held up in the courts until Trump last month instructed the corps to advance construction.

This is the largest Keystone oil spill to date in South Dakota, Walsh said. The leak comes just days before Nebraska officials announce a decision on whether the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline, a sister project, can move forward. In April 2016, there was a 400-barrel release -- or 16,800 gallons -- with the majority of the oil cleanup completed in two months, Walsh said. About 5,000 barrels of oil spilled Thursday. There were no initial reports of the oil spill affecting waterways, water systems or wildlife, he said. The spill has been controlled, the company said, with no further environmental impacts observed and no threat to public safety. TransCanada said it was working with state and federal agencies. The Environmental Protection Agency is monitoring the situation and will provide resources and assistance if needed, a spokesman said. Concerns about the spill The Keystone Pipeline system stretches more than 2,600 miles, from Hardisty, Alberta, east into Manitoba and then south to Texas, according to TransCanada. The pipeline transports crude oil from Canada. The proposed Keystone XL Pipeline, which would stretch from Hardisty to Steele City, Nebraska, would complete the proposed system by cutting through Montana and South Dakota. The sections of pipeline affected stretch from Hardisty to Cushing, Oklahoma, and to Wood River, Illinois, the company said. The spill occurred in the same county as part of the Lake Traverse Reservation. The leak location is not on Sioux property, but it is adjacent to it and has historical value, said Dave Flute, tribal chairman for Sisseton Wahpeton Sioux Tribe. Flute, along with the tribal emergency management director and the manager of the tribal office of environmental protection, arrived Friday morning at the staging area of the leak site to meet with representatives from TransCanada. Flute said he was out there to offer assistance and to understand the cause of the leak and the environmental impacts it might pose. We don't know. Environmental activist group Greenpeace said the spill shows the new pipeline in Nebraska should not be approved. New Keystone XL In March, President Donald Trump's administration officially issued a permit that approved construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Environmentalists also opposed the pipeline because it would cut across the Ogallala Aquifer, one of the world's largest underground deposits of fresh water. Tar sands oil is much thicker and stickier than traditional oil, significantly complicating cleanup efforts. The fact it's thicker also means it needs to be combined with other hazardous materials to allow it to be transported in pipelines. Native American groups have argued the pipeline would cut across their sovereign lands. Trump said the new pipeline will be a big win for American workers, but critics say it won't be, because most of the jobs would be temporary. Dakota Access Pipeline TransCanada said Thursday that the section of the Keystone Pipeline that was leaking was isolated within 15 minutes after a drop in pressure was detected. According to the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources' website, this is the third pipeline spill in the state this year. Another came in April when about 84 gallons of crude oil leaked from the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in Spink County. That pipeline, which runs through both Dakotas and two other states, drew fierce resistance from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota, the tribe's allies and environmentalists. Opposition to the pipeline sparked monthslong protests, with as many as 10,000 people participating during the peak of the demonstrations. Clashes with police at the protests turned violent at times, with one woman nearly losing her arm after an explosion last November. CNN's Eric Levenson and Deanna Hackney contributed to this report.

From there it can be shipped to the Gulf Coast and potentially lucrative markets abroad. It has the capacity to move half of the oil produced daily in North Dakota, the nation's second-leading producer behind Texas. President Donald Trump had pushed for the pipeline's completion, and the Army Corps of Engineers dropped a plan to conduct more environmental study after he took office. The Corps permitted the pipeline project. The tribe is among four that have challenged the pipeline in court over environmental fears that Texas-based ETP says are unfounded. The judge said the Corps also didn't adequately study how the pipeline might disproportionately affect the tribal community - a concept known as environmental justice. That aims to ensure development projects aren't built in areas where minority populations might not have the resources to defend their rights. In its analysis of the Missouri River crossing, the Corps studied the mostly white demographics in a half-mile (0.8-kilometer) radius, which the agency maintains is standard. But if the agency had gone another 88 yards (80 meters) - about the length of a football field - the study would have included the Standing Rock Reservation. The tribe accused the Corps of gerrymandering. Boasberg ordered the Corps to reconsider certain areas of its environmental analysis, and took arguments on whether to shut down the 1,200-mile (1,930-kilometer) pipeline while the work is done. Corps attorneys said the agency expects to be able by the end of the year to substantiate its earlier determination that the pipeline poses no significant environmental threats. Their assertion is backed by numerous energy trade groups. Tribal attorneys argued that the company had overstated the potential effects of a shutoff and questioned whether the Corps will take the additional review seriously, saying a shutdown would create incentive for the agency to do so. The tribes also proposed a fallback plan if Boasberg decided against a shutdown. It included increased public reporting of pipeline issues such as repairs, and implementation of a spill response plan - including equipment staging - at Lake Oahe. All rights reserved.

Nov. 23, 2016 President-elect Donald J. Trump, however, has taken a different view of the project and said as recently as last week that he supported finishing the 1,170-mile pipeline, which crosses four states and is almost complete. Mr. Trump owns stock in the company building the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, but he has said that his support has nothing to do with his investment. There was no immediate response from Energy Transfer Partners, but its chief executive, Kelcy Warren, has said that the company was unwilling to reroute the pipeline, which is intended to transport as much as 550,000 barrels of oil a day from the oil fields of western North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois. Reaction was swift on both sides, with environmental groups like Greenpeace praising the decision.

But on Sunday, several campers said they were not going anywhere.

The tribe has been fighting the pipeline in court for over two years. Last April, a small group set up a prayer camp along the water in protest of the pipeline. Within months, the camp had grown to a population of thousands as people from all over the country traveled to live at the camps and join in protest. In addition, the Obama administration set up consultations with tribes all over the country in an attempt to improve relationships and respect treaty rights. Watch the VICELAND documentary on Standing Rock: The pipeline is nearly done, with only the area crossing approximately 7.34 acres remains to be built. Lawyers for ETP said in court Monday that the pipeline could be finished in 60 to 90 days from the time construction starts up again, with oil flowing in about 83 days after that. The concern for the tribe now is that construction could outpace litigation. Outside of court, protests against the DAPL are likely to continue. On Tuesday, the Seattle City Council voted to divest from Wells Fargo, an investor in the pipeline. And the sudden granting of the easement has not changed the rhetoric around the pipeline one iota.

Share163 Tweet Email Image: AP Image: AP FOR THE PAST four months, Native Americans, environmentalists and celebrities have been gathering in North Dakota against a decision to place an oil pipeline under the Missouri River and the man-made Lake Oahe. A satellite image shows the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline (top right), while hundreds of protesters fighting the pipeline gather (bottom centre). The sit-in protest, which began in earnest in August, has gathered more than 100 Native American tribes to the campsite near Cannon Ball to protest against and try to stop the final leg of the oil project being implemented. Former US Vice President Al Gore, Democratic presidential nominee Senator Bernie Sanders, Hollywood actors Murk Ruffalo, Shailene Woodley and Leonardo DiCaprio have all criticised the proposals. The camp, called Seven Council Fires, began growing in August as it took in the overflow crowd from smaller protest sites nearby. It now covers a half square mile, with living quarters that include old school buses, fancy motorhomes and domelike yurts. Hale bales are piled around some teepees to keep out the wind. The number of inhabitants has ranged from several hundred to several thousand. It has been called the largest gathering of Native American tribes in a century. Source: David Goldman Increasingly, more permanent wooden structures are being erected, even though the Army Corps of Engineers considers them illegal on government property. Violence The protests were peaceful and unobstructed until mid-October, when local police moved in to break-up encampments on public roads and on private land. Protest organisers said 167 people were hurt, including three Native American tribal elders, and that seven people have been hospitalised for severe head injuries. People have been hit with (tear gas) canisters in the chest or the leg and that sort of thing. Mountains of donated food and water are being stockpiled, as is firewood, much of which has come from outside of North Dakota, the least-forested state in the nation. A collection of army surplus tents with heating stoves serve as kitchen, dining hall, medical clinic and a camp-run school. Many of the smaller tents have become tattered by the wind. Tribes from the Great Plains states are adept at surviving brutal winters, he said. Others from warmer climes are being taught how to endure the frostbite-inducing temperatures that are sure to come. Reddog said she has confidence in the camp community. The latest Source: David Goldman The latest development occurred last night, when the Army Corps of Engineers refused to grant the company permission to extend the pipeline beneath a Missouri River reservoir. The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing. Other reasons are much more personal.

The company building the 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, said late on Sunday that it had no plans to reroute the line, and expected to complete the project. The pipeline is complete except for a 1-mile (1.61 km)segment that was to run under Lake Oahe, which required permission from federal authorities.

And Energy Transfer Partners is promising that the Dakota Access Pipeline will go forward as planned. On Sunday, the Army Corps of Engineers determined that one piece of the pipeline needs a full environmental impact study (EIS), a months-long process that looks at whether the line is appropriately sited, where alternative routes could go, and who will be impacted. The EIS is required for a length of the pipeline that would run under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River, a half mile north of the Standing Rock Reservation. On one side, you have money, President-elect Donald Trump, and a network of fossil fuel infrastructure. On the other, you have protesters, lawyers, and time. Trying to Trump this decision would be a bad idea In the immediate aftermath of the announcement, environmentalists were quick to wonder if this was yet another Obama administration decision that the president-elect can reverse come January 20. There is good reason to be concerned. Trump is personally invested in both ETP and a company that will eventually own 25 percent of the completed pipeline. He clearly wants the project to go forward. There is a mountain of paperwork to get through Tribe members and supporters, including many indigenous groups, have been protesting the Lake Oahe section for months, clashing with militarized authorities and drawing national attention to the project. They have also sued the Army Corps over its handling of the permit process. Native American tribes are sovereign states, and permitting agencies are required to consult with the tribes on any environmental issues. Advertisement In addition, it simply makes sense to conduct a full environmental review for a project of this size, said Jan Hassleman, an attorney with Earthjustice who is representing the tribe. The most likely outcome of the EIS is that the pipeline is, in fact, rerouted. There is an alternative route that ETP considered that takes the line 10 miles north of Bismarck. But if it moves ahead with construction without a permit, its bank financing could be at risk, since financing agreements almost always stipulate that the loan party must be in good standing. Market forces are already undermining the financial viability of a pipeline bringing crude oil from North Dakota. But there are multiple market factors at work against the pipeline. Since Dakota Access was proposed in 2014, oil prices have fallen dramatically, even while production from the Bakken formation has decreased. OPEC, the international oil production group, recently agreed to limited production, thrusting global oil prices back up, at least temporarily. Meanwhile, new data from the Energy Information Administration shows that oil exports from the United States have gone up 1,000 percent since 2009. But Williams-Derry said that this current market volatility is, while far from predictive, certainly worrying for investors in the project. The Keystone XL permit rejection opened the doors for a multi-billion dollar lawsuit against the United States. The Shell decision to back out of the Arctic did not stop drilling there. The Paris climate agreement is on shaky ground. But the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe might have just triggered a complete rethinking of how the U.S. government interacts with the Indian nations."}, {"URL": "http://hpr1.com/index.php/feature/news/the-thin-black-line/", "Timestamp": "20180918222910", "Sentences": "Troopers patrolling alongside the convoy stayed in constant contact over the radio, watching to see if the activists split up. During his 13 years with the Highway Patrol, he has drawn the weapon, but has never fired his sidearm in the line of duty. In North Dakota, the No DAPL National Day of Action disrupted commerce on the BNSF railroad for more than three hours. Pro DAPL supporters lined up against anti DAPL activists at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers center; law enforcement prepared for confrontation. One male was arrested at the scene of the domestic quarrel, and Iverson turned his attention toward more than 175 activists who were gathering at the Bank of North Dakota, and at North Dakota National Guard Fraine Barracks. After the controversy dies down, they will all need time to heal and work together again. He also understands the majority of activists at Standing Rock are peaceful, but adds there is a violent group bent on doing whatever it takes to stop the pipeline. That being said, the laws of North Dakota were made by the people. We are charged with enforcing those laws, so it is a representation of the people as a whole. Personally I would say when the time gets closer to boring under the river, the final piece, it would only make sense that those who are committed to civil disobedience and violence will go to more desperate measures. And the North Dakota Highway Patrol, along with other agencies involved, will do whatever they have to do in response, and for as long as it takes, he said. Departments involved are emotionally exhausted. Lines are strained. But we will do whatever it takes to make sure that we are keeping up and providing adequate resources to do what the citizens of North Dakota expect us to do. Iverson has received many emails and telephone calls from people who feel law enforcement response has been brutal and unnecessary. Less than five emails, he said, were from North Dakota residents. Video footage from media outlet Digital Smoke Signals shows drill equipment has already arrived. Recently, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers temporarily denied Dakota Access Pipeline workers the easement needed to burrow under the Missouri River at Lake Oahe, a declaration called hypocritical by the Morton County Commission Chairman Cody Schulz. He said he has asked for federal assistance, but none has been forthcoming. If DAPL begins horizontal drilling, Iverson will make sure the work is shut down immediately and violators arrested, he said. On the front lines Iverson flipped through notes taken on the No DAPL National Day of Action. License plate numbers and states were penned neatly on a legal pad. Only one vehicle was from North Dakota, the rest came from California, Utah, and elsewhere. North Dakota has never seen nor handled such mass violence before, he said. The DAPL controversy is a historical event, and the eyes of the world are upon the Peace Garden State. The United Nations, President Obama, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have petitioned Energy Transfer Partners to voluntarily halt pipeline construction, but the company plows ahead, destroying burial grounds and sacred sites, according to a September 2016 lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and filed by former Standing Rock historic preservation officer Tim Mentz Sr. Not once have law enforcement outnumbered the activists, Iverson said. Their nametags are now hidden because officers were targeted. Some received death threats; others were followed home. This is something that is very concerning and we have zero time for that. Now, Iverson always doubles back at night, watching for following cars. He rarely takes the same route twice. Maybe. Iverson has also investigated social media, looking for additional threats. There are people who would love nothing more than to kill a law enforcement officer. With the recent rise in fake news posted often on Facebook, Iverson said that the rumors law enforcement sent aircraft to demoralize the activists, that officers have urinated on native belongings, that the departments involved are racists, are untrue. The relationship between Highway Patrol and Standing Rock historically has been good, he said, and after this controversy passes, he hopes it will improve. The militarization of law enforcement is partly to intimidate, in the hopes that people will back down quickly from any situation. The use of Bearcats however, is for their own safety. He recalled the night at Backwater Bridge when Molotov Cocktails were thrown at the police line. His cruiser would have taken heavy damage, and put his life in jeopardy, he said. Yes. At every event, law enforcement has repeatedly petitioned the activists to disperse before resorting to less-than-lethal weapons, Iverson said. Law enforcement is a primarily a reacting force during standoffs. Some people have condemned law enforcement actions for not arresting sooner, he said. Bismarck Police Chief Dan Donlin agreed. They want you to draw first blood so they can crush you. Police have seen peaceful rallies and violent rallies, but most rallies contain a mix of both peaceful and violent agitators, Donlin said. He also warned those supporting police, and those who are pro DAPL, to abide by the laws. If the activists were all white, Iverson said there would be no difference in law enforcement reaction. Local negative reaction is worsening now that native peoples are standing up for themselves, he said. Hatred has been given a license. Incidents such as the one involving a local DAPL worker who nearly ran over activists and fired a sidearm six times in the air last week, will increase. To protest peacefully is legal; civil disobedience carries consequences, Iverson said. In August when Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II pushed his way through a police crowd and when horses charged the police line, forcing retreat, and in late October when buffalo were herded towards police flanks, the protest is no longer deemed peaceful, Iverson said. A curse lies on those who dig up sacred grounds, Mentz said during a hearing at Standing Rock, and it is a curse coming from the earth, from disturbed spirits who will rise with vengeance to drive DAPL workers mad. Civil disobedience is typically a conscious decision made by an activist, protester, or water protector to affect change. While law enforcement arrests those who break the laws, the civil disobedient are defying what they consider laws already broken by Energy Transfer Partners. Author and long-time environmental attorney, Robert F.Kennedy Jr., visited Standing Rock this week and condemned Energy Transfer Partners saying their actions were illegal. A reporter asked Kennedy what was the point of protesting any longer now that the pipeline is almost finished. The fast tracked pipeline is an old trick approved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a loophole in environmental assessment laws. By segmenting the pipeline route into small sections for approvals nullifies the need for a full environmental impact assessment along the entire route. A fully assessment would certainly be denied, Kennedy said. The pipeline will produce the same amount of carbon as 29 coal burning factories, he said. Another argument made by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is that the pipeline is on lands that belonged to them under the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie. Their eminent domain declaration at the northern Treaty Camp was on lands that belonged to the tribe until the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers took the land away after devastating floods incurred by the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program from 1944. More than 200,000 acres of Indian land was flooded because of the project, effectively impoverishing many within Standing Rock tribe whose old homes are at the bottom of Lake Oahe, where the Dakota Access Pipeline plans to run. Trespassing will always be trespassing, he said. Criteria for conducting a legal protest include obtaining a legal license. No protests on private property are legal, Iverson said, unless, of course, permission is granted by the owner. Staying at the main camp Oceti Sakowin is not good enough for many of the activists involved with Standing Rock. Every day DAPL construction is halted is considered a victory, and every time activists are able to reach DAPL equipment, construction workers must stop, Iverson said. We as a society cannot accept that. The Dakota Access Pipeline controversy remains in limbo; both sides say there is a front line, and both sides believe their fight is right. Activism against the pipeline will continue; law enforcement will keep making arrests. Its decision came after the bank received 120,000 signatures urging the bank and other financial institutions to pull finances from the project. Friday: More than 130 felony charges against activists dismissed by Morton County courts. The North Dakota Department of Health activated a low power radio transmitter that operates at 1620 AM, which will be transmitting public health, safety, and other information near to Oceti Sakowin. A total of 1,287 officers from 25 counties in North Dakota, 20 cities, and nine states, which include Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, have assisted Morton County during the DAPL controversy, according to rom Morton County Sheriff's Department.

This summer, Tim Mentz Sr. took to YouTube to tell the world about the destruction of his cultural heritage. A former tribal historic preservation officer of the Standing Rock Sioux, Mentz wore a baseball cap, rimless glasses and two thin braids of graying hair. He was upset and spoke rapidly about the area behind him, an expanse of the Great Plains cut by a new 150-foot-wide road. RELATED: The Vicious Dogs of Manifest Destiny Resurface in North Dakota Two days before, Mentz had testified to the D.C. District Court to report the area that lay in the path of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) corridor holds 82 cultural features and 27 graves. By the next day, DAPL construction workers graded the area. Behind where Mentz stood in the video was a place known as the Strong Heart Society Staff, where a sacred rattle or staff was placed within stone rings. Here members of the elite warrior society would come to make pledges. As an anthropologist who has worked with Native Americans for more than a decade to document their sacred places in the paths of new power plants, power lines, water pipelines and more, the battle in North Dakota is all too familiar. Consultation with tribes too often breaks down because federal agencies are unwilling to consider how Native Americans view their own heritage. Irreplaceable heritage If completed, the Dakota Access Pipeline would run from North Dakota to Illinois for nearly 1,200 miles, carrying up to 570,000 barrels of crude oil per day. DAPL would meander across the landscape, through farms, around cities, buried underground and across more than 200 waterways. The passage of the pipeline over and under waterways requires permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This federal authorization in turns requires compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). When considering a new undertaking, a number of effects on historic properties must be considered: direct (like physical destruction), indirect (like spoiling a viewshed), short-term, long-term, or cumulative (like how one pipeline may not harm a site, but perhaps a dozen of them will). The NHPA does not guarantee preservation. For many years, Native Americans would have had little input on a project such as DAPL. But in 1992, Congress amended the NHPA to formally include traditional cultural properties. The amendments directed federal agencies, in carrying out their responsibilities under the NHPA, to consult with Indian tribes that attach religious and cultural significance to these sacred places. Beyond consultation Native American protesters say the oil pipeline is threatening indigenous cultural heritage. Photo: Reuters In North Dakota, federal and state review and compliance measures for DAPL were combined. Engineers rerouted DAPL to avoid all but nine sites. Archaeologists serve an important role in documenting historic properties. But they tend to view the world through the lens of science and history. They search out buried villages, pottery shards, bones, broken stone tools. Traditional cultural properties in the U.S. can often be archaeological sites, artifacts that ancestors once touched and places that mark ancestral homes. But just as often they can be a mountain where spirits dwell or a spring where water is gathered for ceremonies. They can be a traditional area for collecting plants or animals that sustain and heal communities. They can be origin places where ancestors emerged onto the earth or named places recalled in ancient tongues. This is why documenting traditional cultural properties requires not the work of archaeologists but Native Americans as well. On one project I conducted with the Hopi tribe to detail cultural resources along a 470-mile power line, we needed weeks of research to identify more than 200 plant species that the tribe uses in its traditional religious and healing practices. When it comes to traditional practices, Native Americans see what archaeologists overlook. Tribal surveys For DAPL, a tribal survey was not undertaken. In North Dakota the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers tried to engage in consultation dozens of times, but the Standing Rock Sioux largely refused because the federal agency only wanted to consult on a narrow corridor at water crossings instead of the entire pipeline. RELATED: US Govt Helps Companies Rob Native Americans of Their Land Once, though, consultation did occur at Lake Oahe on March 8, 2016. Current designs call for the pipeline to go under this now controversial waterway, which the Sioux want protected. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials admitted they were unaware of some of these sites. On Sept. 21 and then again on Oct. 20, according to an email I received from the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Office, delegations that included law enforcement, Standing Rock Sioux officials and tribal and state archaeologists went to the areas that Mentz suggested contained 82 sites and 27 burials. Two bones were recovered, but analysis showed them to be from a horse, cow, or bison. It would seem that the main sites Mentz agonized over had escaped physical destruction. However, tribal input would be needed to determine if the sites, so close to the corridor, could still suffer from indirect and cumulative impacts. Not too late Because consultation broke down and so little of the pipeline has received tribal survey, we must wonder how much has been missed. Nearly 90 percent of the pipeline has already been completed. This is an unfortunate but common occurrence. Last month I went out with traditional leaders of the Zuni tribe in New Mexico to identify traditional cultural properties under the NHPA in the path of a massive network of water pipelines. When we arrived, we found dozens of construction workers busily laying the new pipe. An archaeological survey was already completed; the construction had begun with the consent of the federal agency. We were too late. This article was originally published on The Conversation. Read the original article.

In an interview with Fargo, N.D., radio station KFGO, Archambault thanked the thousands of people who have joined members of the tribe to protest the construction of the pipeline near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. And everybody can just relax and go home. And it's an opportunity for them to go home.

In the past two weeks, 2 feet of snow has fallen on the area. Members of the tribe are protesting the pipeline because they say it could contaminate water and that the route threatens sacred lands.

Caroline Grueskin, Tribune Buy Now The feeling at camp on Monday was busy but calm. The clash came as protesters sought to push past a bridge on a state highway that had been blockaded since late October, according to the Morton County Sheriff's Office. The attempt escalated into hours of conflict in which protesters reportedly threw rocks and logs at police, who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and cold water. It was the most tense conflict between law enforcement and opponents of the 1,168-mile crude oil pipeline in weeks, and led to at least 26 serious injuries among protesters, according to a camp medical group, and one officer was reportedly hit in the head with a rock. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier, who said police used fire hoses not water cannons as reported by numerous protesters, said water is not normally used by his department as a method to disperse a crowd. He said field commanders on scene who made the decision to use fire hoses on protesters considered the effect the water would have on people in the cold temperatures. when asked whether the use of force was necessary to keep officers safe. Law enforcement would consider using water again, he said. Kirchmeier said local law enforcement has begun getting federal aid in the form of Customs and Border Patrol officers. Protesters have voiced concerns that a leak in the pipeline would contaminate the Missouri River and Angela Bibens, an attorney who works at the camp, did not miss the irony that people protesting about protecting water were being repelled with it. Bibens said her team was taking statements throughout the day in preparation for a potential lawsuit alleging police brutality. Amnesty International said Monday they would send human rights observes to the pipeline protests, for their fourth visit since August. Treating injuries Michael Knudsen, a member of the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council, was giving medical treatment at the front line of the protest on Sunday night. He said people were suffering mostly from hypothermia, as well as blunt trauma from the rubber bullets and tear gas contamination. Knudsen said ambulances from Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, Kidder and Morton counties were present. According to a release from the medic and healer council, 300 people in total were injured in some form. At least 26 seriously injured people had to be evacuated by ambulance to three area hospitals, according to the release. Sanford Health spokesman Jon Berg said nine people were treated at Sanford but he could not release information on their condition. Cecily Fong, public information officer for the Department of Emergency Services said six were treated at the Fort Yates Hospital. One person was in serious condition at the Hennepin County Medical Center, according to the hospital. Among the most serious injuries were a man who had a seizure, an elder who had to be resuscitated and a woman suffering an eye injury from a rubber bullet to the face, according to the release from the medic and healer council. Protesters criticize the barricade as blocking emergency services and suggest it is being used to prevent access to construction sites just north. North Dakota Department of Transportation spokeswoman Jamie Olson said the department has not received any update from law enforcement on when they might be able to come do testing. She said testing can still be done despite the cooler temperatures but snow or ice would complicate the process. 'Figured it was time' Aidoneus Bishop helped pull one burned vehicle off the bridge Sunday night. He said the move was the end of a two-week-long ritual, in which he would pull a semi-truck up to the burned vehicles as if to tow them, then turn back around to camp. Protesters started arriving to check on what was happening. From there, officers started firing the rubber bullets and more people gathered on the bridge and across the fields to the sides. This led to the long confrontation with police, in which protesters started fires and allegedly threw rocks and burning logs at officers, according to Kirchmeier. Law enforcement responded by spraying the protesters with water and firing rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray into the crowd. Protesters left the bridge late Monday at the request of tribal elders after police warned the crowd that they had found firearms, the Associated Press reported. Bishop said police were reinforcing the barricade with razor wire as protesters retreated. Among the crowd on the bridge Sunday night was Elih Lizama, 24, who stayed for four hours despite several hits from rubber bullets, he said. He fended off some of them with a plastic container lid, which ultimately broke, and then picked up a piece of sheet metal, which he said worked better. He came back to camp after four hours when his girlfriend said it was time. Bismarck Tribune reporter Jessica Holdman and Forum News Service reporter Amy Dalrymple contributed to this article.

According to court documents oil drillers have the right to void their contracts with ETP if the pipeline is not finished by January 1st, which could result in steep losses for the developers.

Vicki Granado, a spokesperson for ETP, says January 1st was the original in-service date and denies the company has any contractual obligation tied to the date. The company could sue the corps for violating due process, but it is likely to hold off until Mr Trump moves into the White House. Hardly anyone on either side of the political divide doubts that the president-elect will approve the easement. But it might take time to settle the matter, which means that ETP and its partners will take a painful financial hit.

One person was arrested, according to the sheriffs department . One hundred sixty-seven people were injured and seven were taken to the hospital, according to Jade Begay, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network. The tribe fears that the pipeline, which is planned to cross under the river less than a mile from the Standing Rock Reservation, will threaten their water source and argue that construction has already disturbed sacred burial grounds. Pipeline construction is almost completed in North Dakota, but the company building it, Energy Transfer Partners, still lacks a final permit to drill under the river. On Tuesday, 15 November, the company went to court seeking to have a judge force the government to allow it to begin drilling immediately. The trucks have been in place for several weeks, and law enforcement has erected a barricade behind them, forcing all traffic to take an approximately 20-mile detour. Begay said that activists did light two bonfires to keep people warm and make soup and tea. Other fires were sparked by law enforcement weapons, she added. The activists successfully moved one of the trucks before law enforcement responded with tear gas, water cannons, and other weapons, Begay said. The violence comes at a difficult time for indigenous activists at the camps, said Archambault. It was always a day of mourning for the day that genocide began on this continent.

According to Mint Press News, Militarized riot police raided two frontline camps on Oct. 27, making 107 arrests as they deployed pepper spray, stun guns, and physical force in response to a crowd of unarmed water protectors who were blocking the path of pipeline construction. The water protectors attempted to keep police and pipeline workers from accessing the construction site by setting fires to barricades, but police were able to eventually remove everyone from the frontline camps and reclaim the land.

Kirchmeier, who has been leading the response to the protests has taken what has been controversial - and some say overly aggressive - action against demonstrators.

'It's just not going to happen.' Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier, front, listens to Brian Wesley Horinek, of Oklahoma, outside the New Camp on Pipeline Easement in North Dakota But US authorities said on Sunday they had no plans to forcibly remove activists. But the US Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the federal land where the main camp protesting the Dakota Access pipeline is located, said last week it would close public access to the area north of the Cannonball River on December 5. On Sunday, the agency said in a statement that it had 'no plans for forcible removal' of protesters. A representative for the agency could not be immediately reached on Sunday to provide further clarification on its plans. Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault said he and Kirchmeier have met many times and each meeting has been tense and unproductive. 'I don't think aggressive force is necessary and he thinks it's necessary,' Archambault said. Archambault called the confrontation an act of terror against unarmed protesters that was sanctioned by Kirchmeier. 'His job is to protect and serve, not to inflict harm and hurt,' Archambault said. But Kirchmeier, who has the backing of the state's Republican governor and attorney general, defended officers' actions. He and other authorities said officers were assaulted with rocks, bottles and burning logs.

'The issue of the pipeline is not going to get solved with protesters and cops looking at each other,' Kirchmeier said. 'This is bigger and takes way more political clout than what the county has to offer.' Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said Kirchmeier is in 'an incredibly difficult position.' 'He has the responsibility to allow people to lawfully exercise their First Amendment rights and he has the obligation to stop it when there is violence contrary to the law,' Stenehjem said. With winter looming, the Corps has decided to close the land north of the Cannonball River where the Oceti Sakowin protest encampment have flourished on December 5, also citing the confrontations between protesters and authorities, according to a letter Archambault said he received. 'To be clear, this means that no member of the general public, to include Dakota Access pipeline protesters, can be on these Corps lands,' the letter provided by the tribe said. The agency says anyone on the property north of the Cannonball River after Dec. 5 will be trespassing and subject to prosecution. Protest organizers said Saturday that they don't intend to leave or stop their acts of civil disobedience.

Since the summer, law enforcement officials have made roughly 700 arrests, in some cases leading to serious felony charges and possibly lengthy state prison sentences. Following recent indictments, at least six activists are now facing charges in federal court. Rumors about JTTF have caused further stress among the activists. Regan said she was able to confirm the identity of one of the JTTF officers, Andrew Creed, who attempted to contact an activist. In November, a JTTF officer also showed up to the hospital room of Sophia Wilansky, a 21-year-old who was seriously injured during a standoff with law enforcement at Standing Rock, according to her father, Wayne Wilansky. The FBI took her clothes and still have not returned them, he said in an interview this week. Witnesses have said they believe she was hit by a police concussion grenade. The timing of the FBI hospital visit in Minneapolis was upsetting, he added. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Activists at Standing Rock have faced blizzard conditions at the camp during the winter months. How Keystone XL and Dakota Access went from opposition to resurrection Read more The attorney said it also seemed likely that JTTF may have contacted other water protectors and said she worried they may not have realized their best option is to remain silent and contact a lawyer. This is not the first time the JTTF has been tied to an investigation of civil rights protesters. Records from Minnesota suggested that the taskforce monitored a Black Lives Matter demonstration. For indigenous leaders who have vowed to continue fighting the pipeline on the ground, the FBI investigations and ongoing federal prosecutions have become increasingly worrisome.

(Reuters) - Two weeks after a victory in their fight against the Dakota Access Pipeline, most protesters have cleared out of the main protest camp in North Dakota - but about 1,000 are still there, and plan to remain through the winter. These folks say they are dug in at the Oceti Sakowin Camp in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, despite the cold, for a few reasons. Most are Native Americans, and want to support the tribal sovereignty effort forcefully argued by the Standing Rock Sioux, whose land is adjacent to the pipeline being built. Future decisions on the 1,172-mile (1,885-km) pipeline are likely to come through discussions with the incoming administration of Donald Trump, or in courtrooms. At one point the camp had about 10,000 people, including about 4,000 veterans who showed up in early December - just before the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied a key easement needed to allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. After the Corps decision, Standing Rock chairman Dave Archambault asked protesters to go home. The camp's population now runs from 700 to 1,000, depending on the day, and many come from the nearby Standing Rock reservation where they live. Logistics are key for those still at the camp, located on federal land. Theron Begay, a Navajo journeyman who is a certified construction worker and heavy machine operator, has been put in charge of winterizing the camp. He is training volunteers to build structures that can withstand sub-zero temperatures and bitter winds, as well as compost toilets. Some people at the camp have gotten pneumonia, and they and others went to an emergency shelter that was built three miles away to escape the cold. Because the Oceti Sakowin camp is located on a flood plain, waste from the camp poses risks to the nearby Cannonball River. Tribal leaders have said the camp may need to move if it wants to remain active. North Dakota's Governor Jack Dalrymple said in a Tuesday statement that he and Archambault recently met to discuss reducing tensions between the tribe and law enforcement. They are discussing reopening the nearby Backwater Bridge on state highway 1806, which has been blockaded since Oct. 27, when activists set vehicles on fire. Some still at the camp worry that if they leave, Energy Transfer Partners will restart construction. ETP asked a federal judge on Dec. 9 to overrule the government's decision and grant the easement. The judge declined that request; the parties are due back in court in February. The Army Corps is considering alternatives, which could take months. Trump, who owned ETP stock through at least mid-2016, according to financial disclosure forms, could order the Army Corps to grant the permit. His choice for U.S. Energy Secretary, former Texas Governor Rick Perry, is on ETP's board. Protesters who remain at the camp are still receiving donations of money and supplies from people across the United States. On a recent visit to the camp's emergency shelter it was filled with boxes delivered via Amazon.com. Goldtooth said tribal leaders are talking about an exit plan for the camp."}, {"URL": "http://www.grandforksherald.com/news/4188323-swat-team-called-dakota-access-pipeline-protests-5-arrested-trespassing", "Timestamp": "20180919012136", "Sentences": "Picture taken December 5, 2016.

Mapes Seattle Times environment reporter While President Trump issued an executive order Tuesday intended to advance construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, restarting the stalled project may not be simple. Jan Hasselman, attorney for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota, said Tuesday the tribe would push back with a lawsuit defending the decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to undertake a full environmental-impact review that includes looking at alternative routes for the 1,100-mile oil pipeline through four states. The tribe has opposed the pipeline out of concern a spill could pollute drinking water in the Missouri River and threaten Native American cultural sites. Roy Murphy, of the Muckleshoot tribe, on why he is protesting with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe against the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota.

Feb. 1: Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back. The Corps withheld action on the easement late last year and instead called for an environmental review that could take more than a year. The pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, needs an easement from the Corps to complete the final crossing under the river. If the easement is granted, construction on the crossing could begin and continue unless a court took action to stop it. The necessary work takes about two weeks, working 24 hours shifts. Crews are already in hotels waiting to get to work, and all equipment is on site to begin the job, a source close to the project said. The drill pad for the crossing is secured behind multiple barriers, and police are promising a stiff resistance to interference. The tribes called for demonstrators to leave last week out of concern for their safety because of predicted seasonal flooding of the river near the area of the camps. The fight against the pipeline became an international cause, drawing opponents to the area from around the nation and world, including many members of Washington state tribes with experience battling fossil-fuel projects in the Pacific Northwest. The company could not immediately be reached for comment. A court could stop the flow of oil in a finished project, he noted.

This story has been updated with the correct information. BASTROP COUNTY, Texas -- Authorities say an excavator cut a crude oil pipeline four miles southwest of Bastrop on Thursday morning, forcing nearby residents to evacuate or shelter in place. County officials said the line was ruptured sometime after 8:30 a.m. July 13 near 417 FM 20, which is just south of Shiloh Road. In a statement, Magellan Midstream Partners, the owner of the Longhorn pipeline, said a contractor was conducting maintenance on the system when it ruptured. The company's preliminary estimate is that 1,200 barrels or 50,400 gallons spilled in the release.The pipeline reportedly carries oil from the Permian Basin to Texas City near Houston. Magellan representatives said the oil was contained to a small area around the pipeline and it has not affected any water resources. The pipeline company said efforts are being made to minimize the environmental impact and public safety. No injuries have been reported. FM 20 was closed in both directions, but as of Friday morning, the roadway is back open for drivers. At 4:30 p.m., officials said the evacuation notice was lifted and residents within one mile of the rupture could return to their homes. Magellan representatives said they would reimburse any resident that incurred extra costs while being evacuated. Thursday night, Magellan representatives and environmental specialists safely recaptured all free-standing oil at the site in Bastrop, according to Magellan. Clean-up will continue Friday. Magellan officials also said repairs will begin on the damaged pipeline later Friday. Authorities said cleanup of the spill would continue until Friday morning. Read the full statement from Magellan Midstream Partners below: Shortly before 9 a.m. The incident occurred when the contractor was conducting maintenance activities on the pipeline, which was in service at the time. The preliminary volume estimate of the release is 1,200 barrels. The pipeline was immediately and safely shut down and the line segment has been isolated. Efforts are in progress to contain the crude oil release to minimize environmental impact and to ensure public safety. As a safety precaution, several families near the site have temporarily evacuated and a section of FM 20 has been closed. There are no injuries associated with the incident.Local emergency responders, Magellan representatives, clean-up crews, and environmental crews are currently on site. All appropriate federal and state agencies have been notified. Clean-up activities will be underway this morning. On Friday, Magellan said they expect to resume normal pipeline operations late this weekend.

But through her tears of happiness, Mossett urged viewers to continue their support for both the water protectors in North Dakota and protesters fighting pipelines around the world. The Dakota Access pipeline, which would carry up to 570,000 barrels of oil from the Bakken oilfields of North Dakota nearly 1,200 miles to a hub in Illinois, is far from the only pipeline under construction in North America. On the East Coast of the United States, the victory at Standing Rock resonated for opponents of the proposed Atlantic Coast Pipeline, which would carry natural gas 600 miles from West Virginia to North Carolina. Jane Kleeb, president of Bold Alliance and director of Bold Nebraska, told ThinkProgress that the decision to deny the easement at Standing Rock reinforces the power of having a diverse coalition rallying behind a cause. And while environmental activism is often painted as a liberal issue, Kleeb said there are plenty of fights taking place in more conservative states like South Carolina and Georgia over pipelines and the question of eminent domain. But the crude-oil-by-rail terminal, which would be built in Vancouver, Washington, just miles from Portland, Oregon, has attracted the attention of some environmental activists: In June, following the derailment of an oil train in Mosier, Oregon, 21 activists were arrested while protesting the practice of shipping crude oil by rail, with another 100 or so participating in the protest."}, {"URL": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/10/native-nations-march-washington-dakota-access-pipeline", "Timestamp": "20180918223017", "Sentences": "The event, the culmination of a four-day protest in the capital, was led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which has been involved in a longstanding dispute with authorities over the construction of an oil pipeline in North Dakota, culminating in a two-mile march through Washington and rally in front of the White House. Judge rejects Standing Rock request to block Dakota Access pipeline drilling Read more With snow falling, the Native Nations Rise march took off from the headquarters of the army corps of engineers, the federal agency that authorized construction of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access oil pipeline. The march wound through the capital and along the way demonstrators paused in front of the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue to erect a tipi. At the White House, protesters demonstrated, danced and prayed in what organizers say is a show of solidarity against the federal government that has a long history of discounting tribal concerns on a range of environmental, economic and social issues. The protesters, some dressed in traditional Native American clothing, snaked through the crowd carrying a black inflatable tube representing an oil pipeline. The Standing Rock protest against the Dakota Access pipeline became an international rallying cry for indigenous rights and climate change activism, drawing thousands of Native Americans to the rural area of Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Little Thunder, a traditional dancer and indigenous activist from the Lakota tribe, dances as he demonstrates in front of the White House. During the days leading up to the rally, Native American leaders and activists met with members of Congress to press them to protect tribal rights. Leaders also set up an encampment of tipis near the Washington monument and held cultural workshops. Work on the pipeline, which is owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, was halted in December by the Obama administration. The army corps of engineers announced that it would look at alternate routes for the pipeline and that it would undertake an environmental impact statement. But in January, Trump signed an executive order giving the pipeline project the go-ahead. The army corps granted an easement for the oil company to drill under a reservoir on the Missouri river that is adjacent to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation and construction resumed in early February. The company has said it would be just a matter of weeks before up to 550,000 barrels of oil a day can begin flowing through the pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux and the Cheyenne River Sioux tribes have filed a joint lawsuit against the pipeline project in federal court.

Mapes Seattle Times environment reporter As winter bears down on the Great Plains, a showdown also looms as thousands of veterans from around the country head to North Dakota vowing to be human shields between police and opponents trying to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which leases the lands for grazing, has also ordered the camp closed to all public access as of Dec. 5. Both explained that the threat of winter to public safety required their action. However, if campers stay, it is at their own risk, officials say. Winter temperatures can plunge into single digits during the day and below zero at night. Snow and cutting wind also arrived this week. About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects. And here's what we're reading related to the controversy.

Emergency services to the camp will not be guaranteed per the evacuation order from Gov. Jack Dalrymple, unless approved on a case-by-case basis by the state Highway Patrol or the Morton County sheriff. Protesters vow to stay, and some 2,000 veterans are expected to arrive Sunday to join the fight by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its allies against the Dakota Access Pipeline. Developer Energy Transfer Partners of Houston has yet to obtain the easement it needs from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to cross under the river and finish the project. No construction or drilling work is under way on either side of the river, said Gary Sanders, sheriff for Emmons County, across the river from the protest camp. The only people on site now at the drilling pads are security, as Dakota Access waits for the easement to let it get drilling under the river, Sanders said. Opponents want to stop the project altogether. Some fear more violence, even death, as confrontations have escalated, most recently on Nov. 20 when police clashed with demonstrators, sending 26 people to the hospital. Some 300 people were treated for chemical contamination and hypothermia after being tear-gassed, hit with pepper spray and rubber bullets, and sprayed with fire hoses in freezing weather. Lonnquist said she fears worse to come. But being on that bridge and watching them purposely give us hypothermia not once but for six hours, I would grab a patient by the jacket and just crunch through a sheet of ice. Veterans Stand for Standing Rock will take its direction from tribal elders, said Marshal Hunter of Seattle, who coordinated veterans scheduled to leave from Seattle on Friday night in a convoy to North Dakota. A Navy veteran, Hunter, 53, works at Boeing as a computer-systems administrator, and lives in Edmonds. There is not an issue with peaceful protest. But Hunter said the show of force against demonstrators is way out of line. The leader of Washington State Veterans for Standing Rock is Jim Petersen, 60, a Navy veteran from Bellingham. He had been thinking about going to Standing Rock for some time, but the Nov. 20 clash, where police used water hoses, pushed him over the edge. So many veterans around the country have volunteered for this trip after the national call went out that another is already being organized for Dec. 10. The effort may become a rolling deployment as long as the Standing Rock Sioux want the help. Veterans participating are instructed to bring no weapons or ammunition and to remain nonviolent no matter what comes. In the past, it has called in reinforcements from Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming in addition to cities and counties throughout North Dakota to defend the pipeline project. Meanwhile more support from Washington tribes, fighting fossil-fuel projects of their own, continues to pour into the camp. A delegation of tribal leaders, drummers and singers from the Quinault Indian Nation, including tribal president Fawn Sharp, is to arrive Monday.

The Oceti Sakowin medical team, working with Standing Rock Sioux tribal medics, said that nearly 200 people got treatment for tear gas, hypothermia and blunt trauma. It was the latest in a series of violent clashes over the fall. But Dakota Access crews began bulldozing anyway, leading to a violent confrontation between protesters and security guards. The Standing Rock Sioux went to federal court to prevent the Dakota Access Pipeline bulldozers from further destroying sacred sites. A US district judge temporarily stopped work on the pipeline, but then issued a ruling clearing the way for work to continue. A lawyer for the tribe stated that they would appeal the decision. The parent company of Dakota Access LLC is Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, whose board of directors includes Rick Perry, the former governor of Texas and whose investors include President-Elect, Donald Trump. The Threat The pipeline is being built near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation near Cannon Ball, North Dakota. Residents of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation immediately petitioned the US Army Corps of Engineers to deny the final permit. In April, residents of the reservation and supporters from other tribes set up camp near the construction site to keep an eye on the pipeline workers who were waiting for approval and preparing to break ground. Standing Rock youth launched a petition called Rezpect our Water, and in mid-July set out on a 500-mile relay run to Washington, DC to deliver a petition of 160,000 signatures. Officials at the Department of the Interior, the EPA and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation voiced concerns. Dozens of environmental groups joined together to oppose it and celebrities spoke out, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Shailene Woodley and Jason Momoa and his Justice League co-stars, including Ben Affleck. The Army Corps of Engineers approved the permit in July. On Aug. 10, construction began and a dozen demonstrators were arrested as they tried to stop it. With thousands of protesters still gathered, Gov. Jack Dalrymple declared a state of emergency on Aug. 19. On August 24, hundreds of protesters gathered in Washington, DC, in front of the federal courthouse waiting for a decision in the case, but the decision was delayed for further review. Shortly afterwards, the federal government issued a statement urging the company to pause construction. The Process The Dakota Access pipeline was fast-tracked from the beginning, using the Nationwide Permit 12 process that treats the pipeline as a series of small construction sites and grants exemption from the environmental review required by the Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. And since it does not cross an international border, as the Keystone XL project did, it escaped a more probing federal analysis of its economic justification and environmental impact, according to the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, David Archambault II, who wrote in a New York Times op-ed that they have been opposing the pipeline since they first learned of it in 2014. The Media Silence The images of guard dogs attacking protesters woke the mainstream media early in September, which had sparsely covered the growing opposition to the pipeline. Throughout the standoff, Mother Jones, Indian Country, AP and local papers like The Bismarck Tribune have provided ongoing coverage and analysis.

We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome. The American Spring will start when there are thousands of really, really pissed off people at the Capital (with 2x2s and baseball bats) all at the same time raising some serious hell against the Lunatics, and idiots absolutely nothing is ever, ever going to happen to these totally bought and paid for by the richest 400 families in the world that are becoming more and more powerful with each passing rigged election thanks to the stupid people. So, scream, yell, chant, stomp your feet, threaten to hold your breath, and beat your drums so the media can show it on the evening news, while all of those who can actually do anything about it are home counting their donation money and laughing all the way to the bank. Yes there is still hope for the America we used to know, but I agree it is fading fast. The protestors are trespassing on private property, committing arson, throwing rocks (one cop in hospital already), and probably trying to set off an IED (evidence has been recovered but it needs to be tied via DNA testing to the young lady who was hospitalized when the explosion went off prematurely). While I have a lot of sympathy for the Sioux who are living on the worst reservations in the country and who are pariahs in local communities, I have no sympathy for arsonists and trespassers and rock throwers and bombers. You would be much happier with the Faux-natics. Stay turned for December 4th to 7th. It could be a game changer if enough vets show up. Heads off with our hopes, prayers and support. ETP is being merged with Sunoco (SXL). The merger deal is complicated and may not benefit shareholders in ETP. My point is that the world of giant pipelines is complex, and is driven by forces far removed from the parcels of property where the oil will flow. It is in the world of big business and finance. The US Army Corps of Engineers is issuing permits incrementally, for very small parts of the total pipeline. For example, a river crossing gets its own permit. In this, the Corps is showing a bias in favor of the corporations. There are limits to the number of acres that are allowed to be damaged under one permit. By splitting the project into tiny units the Corps allows the project to proceed. The total damage for the hundreds-of-mil es-long pipeline might exceed the limit. This is where Obama could step in. He could ask the Corps of Engineers to review the permitting of the pipeline. He could save face and let the Corps take the heat. Certainly their own small departments cannot handle by any stretch of the imagination the costs of their officers being called up like military units. Remembering that there is such a thing as bribing a police officer, or in this case entire units. Hmmmm.... Inquiring minds want to know. I think it is likely that the builders and financiers of the pipeline are covering some or all of the extra costs. As you say, it would be interesting to follow the money.

In the snowy prairies of North Dakota, the Oceti Sakowin Camp has become the longest-running protest in modern history, as thousands of American Indians and environmentalists seek to halt completion of the 1,172-mile pipeline. In the coming days, the demonstrators will be aided by military veterans who have come to give occupiers a respite and call attention to what they say are human rights violations committed by local law enforcement. Demonstrators have described being attacked by security dogs, sprayed with tear gas, shot with rubber bullets and blasted by water cannons. Cloud, 32, of Wisconsin said she cried watching images of security dogs attacking pipeline opponents. And she was disgusted when police doused protesters with water cannons in subfreezing temperatures here. I protected this country. The corps did not authorized the occupation and has told protesters they must leave the camp by Monday for their own safety, as brutally harsh winter conditions set in. Organizers predict some 3,000 veterans will amass at the camp by the time official demonstrations are expected to begin Monday. Clark declined to be interviewed, but he wrote on Facebook that veterans here are following in the footsteps of Civil Rights giants Martin Luther King Jr. and Mohandas Ghandi. On Saturday, law enforcement officers said they held productive discussions with leaders of the veterans group. Police have agreed to retreat and move their militarized road blockade further away from the camp, so long as demonstrators agreed to keep their distance and stay off of private land in the area. Gen. Spider Marks, a member of the pro-pipeline Midwest Alliance for Infrastructure Now, says the veterans at the camp do not represent all military veterans. Many vets work on the pipeline construction crews, he said, as well as in the ranks of local enforcement. And he noted that the pipeline company has followed the law and regulations in its work.

Near a bridge on North Dakota Highway 1804, law enforcement officers have erected concrete barriers, razor wire barricades and amassed several military vehicles to keep protesters from approaching them or pipeline workers. The general said the scene reminded him of the heavily guarded compounds he lived in during deployments to Iraq. 'WE'RE ALREADY WON' At dawn on Saturday, about 150 people huddled close together near the icy Cannonball River for a daily water ceremony. They bobbed up and down and swayed back and forth to keep warm as temperatures hovered in the 20s. Others watched on in silence. Speakers stood on wooden pallets placed atop the frozen mud of the river bank. They preached about their connection to the elements. One prayed to the four directions. Another talked about the spotlight the veterans would bring to their cause. Beatrice Menasekwe Jackson, a Native American from Michigan, said she performs a water ceremony like this each morning no matter where she is at the time. Jackson, 67, said she wished she could confront every pipeline worker to tell them how important the water is. She is frustrated with the pipeline company, but not deterred. She looked behind him, where a few camp fires slowly lifted rings of smoke into the foggy skies. Her view was a nearly endless tapestry of teepees, motorhomes and tents.

The news traveled traveled quickly across Oceti Sakowin camp, where many had just finished their evening meals. As I walked along the dirt road that splits the community in two, I saw people of all races, ages, and backgrounds shaking their heads. one man yelled. In the distance, prayers were being sung and drums pounded, low but strong. During my all-too-brief visit to the camp last Friday, people from North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and Washington all stopped to talk, or at least shake hands, in the middle of their work. They identify as Water Protectors, tasked with safeguarding their ancestral land and local water supply from destruction at the hands of the oil industry and the American government. My status as a media outsider who only made it to Standing Rock for a day during his Thanksgiving trip back home makes it impossible for me to make blanket statements about the camp. I can neither confirm nor deny if white people really are turning it into Burning Man, and I can't speak to the aggression of the Morton County Sheriff's Department. I can only tell you what I saw first-hand. During my 24 hours at Standing Rock last week, the police seemed eager to keep their distance after their violent use of water cannons and concussion grenades against protectors only days earlier raised shock and outrage across the country. Inside the camp, which runs between a two-lane road and the icy Cannonball River, workers raised tipis, kids sorted through clothing donations, and strangers from across the country chatted while chopping wood for the camp's sacred fire. The air at Standing Rock is heavy with deep reverence for the past and hope for the future of the land. It's been reported that if Energy Transfer Partners doesn't finish the DAPL by January 1st, companies committed to using their pipeline can back out of contracts, costing them millions. Time is running out. Police have begun stopping cars and trucks headed to Standing Rock with fresh supplies and handing out fines. Some say they've stopped plowing nearby roads. This weekend, thousands of armed services veterans will self-deploy to the camp in the name of protecting the protectors from militarized police. Next week, the evictions are slated to begin. The imbalance of power surrounding the NoDAPL movement is obvious. America's legacy of destroying Native life is undeniable. And still, the emotion I encountered most at Standing Rock was one of hope, built on human trust, holy traditions, and the vigor that comes from battling injustice. If the water protectors are beaten down, uprooted, and cast aside it will be remembered as a deep national disgrace suffered for the sake of corporate profits.

(photo: AP) Donald Trump Picks Billionaire to Oversee Review of Dakota Access Pipeline By Indianz.Com 25 December 16 billionaire businessman with no experience in Indian issues is slated to oversee the federal agency whose handling of the Dakota Access Pipeline has come under repeated criticism. Vincent Viola went from a humble immigrant background to the founder of a highly-successful financial firm in New York. A huge legal, political and public relations challenge will be facing Viola should be confirmed as Secretary of the Army. Officially, the project is on hold in order for the Army Corps to conduct a more thorough review of the final portion of the pipeline in response to concerns raised by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its many allies. But the process has yet to begin, more than two weeks after Jo-Ellen Darcy, who is the outgoing Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, announced the December 4 decision on the easement. With Trump coming on board in just a month, the Army Corps doesn't have much time to get the ball rolling. It's crucial for the review to start soon because it would be difficult -- though not impossible -- for the incoming administration to change course. Even before winning the November 8 election, Trump made no secret of his support for large scale infrastructure projects like Dakota Access. He's now stacking his team with pro-development figures, including former Texas governor Rick Perry, his pick to lead the Department of Energy. Perry sits on the board of directors for Energy Transfer Partners, the firm behind the pipeline. Though he comes from a business background, Viola doesn't come with similar baggage or preconceptions about pipelines. At the same time, he doesn't have any experience with Indian Country either and the Army Corps' handling of Dakota Access has been seen as a failure of its tribal policy. Separate from the pending environmental review, the Army Corps has to defend itself from a cross-claim filed by the wealthy backers of Dakota Access. The firm argues that it has a right to drill under the Missouri River, less than a half-mile north of Standing Rock, despite lacking the easement that was denied this month. The agency is facing a January 6, 2017, deadline -- before Trump is sworn into office -- to submit crucial papers in court on the issue. The Department of Justice, which will soon be under new leadership, plans to contest the cross-claim, an attorney said at a December 9 hearing in D.C. Judge James E. Boasberg agreed to the request as he prepares for a hearing in early February on the easement. By that time, though, Trump will be in office. Beyond the legal and political realms, the new Trump administration will have to face the public, which has rallied behind Indian Country in its effort to stop the pipeline from crossing the Missouri River. We will not stop. A string of brutal winter storms has prompted many to leave, with promises to return once conditions improve. Earlier this month, the population there swelled to 10,000 with the arrival of nearly 4,000 veterans and other supporters. During the late summer and early fall, anywhere between 5,000 to 7,000 people were regular visitors and workers to the camps, located on land promised to the Sioux Nation by treaty. Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services. It is, however, important to note that in all likelihood hardened operatives are attempting to shape the dialog our community seeks to engage in. Adapt and overcome. This time the fight will be out in the open, though, in plain sight, unable to be hidden. Thousands of whites, Indians from all over the United States, probably several thousand veterana, famous celebrities standing against a multitude of police forces from several states. We the people against the all powerful state. Standing Rock may be the turning of the tide against Trump. A wonderful and fitting climax to a long, hard fight --- for water. Hopefully that would slow their actions down for the next battle. A monopoly game. But it isn't. It's real and Trump and his appointees are a great danger. The water protectors know this. I hope the rest of the country mobilizes to address this before we lose too much. Their ethical violations will be waived with pardons by the President. The Republicans in Congress will be rewarded for keeping quiet by having future elections cancelled. All in the name of Trump.

The tribe's struggle to halt the Dakota Access pipeline completion has inspired people across the United States. But the protests reveal more than Standing Rock's legitimate defense of their land; it also unveils troubling realities at the governmental level. Conflicts of interest Then-GOP candidate Donald Trump joined a petroleum conference in North Dakota. According to the Dickinson Press, Christmann recused himself after learning the proposed route would travel across his mother-in-law's property, which is also willed to his wife. Christmann's mother-in-law was negotiating an easement with Dakota Access. The protests also shed light on a possible conflict of interest for President-elect Donald Trump.

According to CNN, around 400 demonstrators and police clashed on Nov. 20, as law enforcement deployed water, rubber bullets and tear gas. Weeks earlier, law enforcement had used riot gear and tanks to remove environmental activists and tribal members from Cannonball Ranch, a private site they used to camp for months, according to the AP. According to Eugene, Oregon-based radio station KLCC, a law firm sued law enforcement agencies and the North Dakota County where the protests have taken place. According to the class-action suit, police employed excessive force against peaceful protesters.

The president said both memos were subject to terms and conditions to be negotiated by the United States. Shares of Energy Transfer Partners and TransCanada both rose more than 3.5 percent on Tuesday. Trump has vowed to cancel Obama's Climate Action Plan and has threatened to pull out of or defund the Paris Climate Agreement, a landmark international accord aimed at reducing mankind's impact on global warming. The Keystone XL would bring oil from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska, where it would connect to an existing pipeline to bring the crude to Illinois. Former President Barack Obama refused to approve the cross-border project, saying the environmental review was not adequate in light of its route through the Sandhills ecosystem in Nebraska. Environmentalists oppose the project because it will encourage the development of Canada's oil sands, a type of oil resource that requires more energy to tap than conventional reserves. Backers of the project say it will reduce U.S. reliance on oil from the Middle East and allow the country to fulfill its energy needs from one of its closest allies. Keystone XL pipeline route, source: TransCanada Former Secretary of State John Kerry denied TransCanada a presidential permit in November 2015, saying the Keystone XL would not have a major impact on America's energy security, lower gas prices or contribute meaningfully to the economy. Dakota Access pipeline route, source: Energy Transfer Partners In a statement on Tuesday, TransCanada said the Keystone XL would create thousands of construction jobs and generate tens of millions of dollars in property taxes annually to counties along the proposed route. The project would employ a significant number of temporary construction workers during the building phase, though pipelines generally do not require much labor to operate in the long term. Obama also backed a delay to completion of the Dakota Access pipeline, which would bring oil from North Dakota to Illinois. Jo-Ellen Darcy, United States assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, said the best path forward was to explore alternative routes for the pipeline, something Energy Transfer Partners says it will not do. Members of the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes, as well as environmentalists from around the country, have fought the pipeline project on the grounds that it crosses beneath a lake that provides drinking water to Native Americans. They say the route beneath Lake Oahe puts the water source in jeopardy and would destroy sacred land. Tribe members and protesters have been camped out for months in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, in opposition to the pipeline. Legal challenges ahead Both projects could still face challenges, according to Bruce Huber, an associate professor of law at the University of Notre Dame who specializes in environmental, natural resources and energy law. The Keystone XL pipeline requires state approval, and Nebraska landowners fought a yearslong legal battle with TransCanada over the project. The company withdrew its application with the state's Public Service Commission in November 2015 after the State Department decision. Nebraska activists are likely to renew their protests, Huber said. Trump has less room to maneuver when it comes to the Dakota Access pipeline, he added. Should the Army Corps of Engineers' current environmental review pave the way for a new route, that plan will likely to face a lawsuit, Huber said. Download the latest Flash player and try again.

The company building the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, has said those claims are baseless. The Dakota Access pipeline is nearly complete, except for one parcel of land owned by the federal government. Energy Transfer needs a final permit to tunnel beneath Lake Oahe on the Missouri River in rural North Dakota. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the owners of that land, announced last week that it was delaying construction of the 1,170-mile pipeline until further analysis. The agency said it also welcomed input from the tribe. The struggle over the Dakota Access Pipeline has intensified, as more protesters have joined the standoff and the company building the pipeline filed suit to get its last permit issued.

Construction in North Dakota prompted protests by Native Americans and environmentalists who say the project will harm water resources and sacred lands. The federal government ruled in December against that stretch of the project. The two protesters, a man and a woman, climbed down after the game ended and were arrested, police said in a statement. After undergoing medical evaluations, the pair were jailed on burglary and trespassing charges. Another woman was charged with obstructing the legal process and also booked into jail, police said. Play was not interrupted during the game, won by the Vikings 38-10, but police said a section of seats below the banner was cleared as a precaution.

I do not know if they will do as I asked, but it is worth a shot. I intend to go to Standing Rock, Lake Oahe on December 4th when Our Veterans will be arriving. I want to offer my support of NODAPL and be available if Medical Assistance is needed. You care about your Constituents and the people of The United States. It would also deny the water protectors access to emergency vehicles and incoming supplies as well as the refusal to allow new water protectors into that area. It is Sioux sacred land that was given to them in the treaties signed by the U. S. Government and the Sioux Nation. And, that portion of the pipeline would run under Lake Oahe and then continue to the Missouri River. Enid Lessne, R. N., B. S. N. (Retired) Lena Toledo 2 years ago Very good intentions Enid. Should the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have completed their Integrated Resources Management Plan (IRMP) when President Clinton provided it to all federally-recognized tribes across Indian Country under his Executive Order 12898 (1994 a comprehensive plan). The tribal members of Standing Rock would have had massive employment opportunities as never before, more than adequate housing needed now more than ever, road improvement needed desperately especially now for the outlying family homes, vast improvement of needed infrastructure repairs, quality health care headed by medical personnel instead of a councilmember related sibling who has absolutely no medical background etc. Most vital this IRMP provided designation of every parcel of land that is to be protected from any intrusion e.g. DAPL inclusive of sacred burial grounds and cultural sites. Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has had 22 years to have completed it although the year 2004 marked the deadline, however, could have been extended. The tribal membership has suffered under 30 years of tribal governing tyranny and has finally resulted into this embarrassing FUBAR protest. Indian tribes were provided their own way of governing in 1934 and Standing Rock is showing its corrupt pattern of practice. Enid Lessne 2 years ago Ms. Toledo, Thank you for replying to my post. I am not a Native American Indian, so I was not aware of the legislation that you mentioned. Because of this fact, I had some difficulty following your explanations. They are not stupid and ignorant people. If the weather gets worse the children, elders, will be removed if they wish to be. I think the State of North Dakota has pushed their tyranny way to far.

This is pure evil vs. good people with rights. Hard to comprehend. Enid Lessne 2 years ago Ms. Miskanis, Thank you for the information you provided. I have written to both of my State Senators, my State Congressman and Senator Sanders in regards to interceding in this matter. I have already received a response from Senator Merkley. I strongly suggest that ALL OF US WRITE TO OUR SENATORS, REPRESENTATIVES AND THE POTUS. There IS strength in numbers. My immediate concern is the 2016-8 evacuation order by North Dakota Governor Dalrymple for December 5th. The area in question is presently deemed Federal property, not State property. The Governor does not have the authority to put an evacuation order into place, nor does he have the power to block roadways leading to that area preventing emergency accessibility or Private Citizens from entering that area- that authority would only come from the USACE themselves, the POTUS or the SCOTUS. Also, the original site for that piece of the DAPL was to run underground in Bismark, North Dakota. Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, in her infinite wisdom, urged that it be moved to the Oceti Sakowin site instead. Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II did speak with some officials of the DAPL as well as the USACE, and he gave them an alternative site for the DAPL which diverted the pipeline away from the Oceti Sakowin site (by a SMALL logistical degree). His suggestion was COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN by both of them. There is a videotape of that formal meeting. I do not know the date of that meeting, but you can easily get it from Chairman Archambault II. The Sioux Nation does not wish to stop the DAPL totally (though they should, due to significant environmental concerns). What the Sioux Nation is asking for is a diversion of the pipeline away from the Standing Rock, Lake Oache parcel. The request made by Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II was and is a reasonable as well as a viable alternative to the present plan of construction. If DAPL were willing to accept that alternative and re-route the pipeline in that particular area, the proposed diversion plan could be put into play quickly. It has also come to my attention that both Senator Heitkamp (responding to pressure from Bismarck residents and possible kickbacks from the DAPL owners) and Governor Dalrymple (who has personal funds invested in DAPL) has vested interests on the DAPL moving ahead according to its current plan without delay. Senator Merkley, again I urge you (if not beg you) to please get this matter corrected- STARTING WITH THE IMMEDIATE REVERSAL OF EVACUATION ORDER 2016-8 WHICH IS TO GO INTO AFFECT ON DECEMBER 5TH. Thank you in advance for taking the time to listen to my concerns, and acting in good faith on behalf of the Sioux Sovereign Nation as well as the Entire U. S. of America. Seriously, thank you for all you are doing. Beverly Samples 2 years ago I think the only way you are going to get people to leave there is to LISTEN to them. Problem solved.

Thousands of people traveled to encampments established near the site of the proposed river crossing in North Dakota. In addition to the protest encampments, opponents of the pipeline have waged divestment campaigns against the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners. Using the slogan Defund DAPL, activists have also urged individuals and institutions to move money out of banks that are financing pipeline construction, including Wells Fargo and Bank of America. Victories thus far include the decisions by a Norwegian bank, DNB, and the Norwegian mutual fund Odin Fund Management to sell their shares in companies connected to the pipeline last November. Other cities are considering similar moves. On Tuesday, the indigenous activist Jackie Fielder helped lead a protest at the San Francisco board of supervisors, which she is hoping to persuade to divest from DAPL-connected banks. Smith said Storeband had worked for months to attempt to influence the pipeline route, with no success. The divestment campaign is gaining steam as the hope of stopping the pipeline dwindles. Construction recommenced on 9 February. According to court filings, the pipeline will be complete and ready to transport oil between 6 March and 1 April.

The Line 5 pipeline transports 540,000 barrel per day of light crude and natural gas liquids from Superior, Wisconsin to Sarnia, Ontario. The latest news comes as the protest against the Dakota Access Pipeline is gaining momentum. The demonstrations have been going on since last April, escalating in intensity. Since August, the total number of protest-related arrests has reached 584, with two protesters arrested on Friday for criminal trespass on Turtle Hill, a site where many clashes with police took place. The protests began when LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, an elder member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, set up the Sacred Stone Camp to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline running under the Missouri River.

And then the incredible happened. On Sunday afternoon, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers legally blocked the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, denying it a needed easement to drill beneath the Missouri River. It will specifically examine whether the pipeline should be moved or cancelled altogether. Energy Transfer Partners sought to avoid the acrimonious public battles that doomed the Keystone XL pipeline by running the Dakota Access pipeline entirely across private land. This freed the firm from seeking public permits in some states. The status of this treaty remains contested. Since the middle of the 20th century, the U.S. government has sought to allay broken treaties with all Native nations by compensating them for lost land. Since a 1980 Supreme Court decision, the U.S. government more or less officially considers the Sioux treaties to be settled. Energy Transfer Partners could correctly say they were building it on private land, not on the present-day Standing Rock Sioux reservation; but the Sioux could correctly refer to the contested ground as tribal or treaty land, referencing the 1851 agreement. Yet this is not even the principal legal dispute in the Standing Rock case. The first, the National Historic Preservation Act, allows the tribe to identify sacred land or cultural sites before the government allows construction that would destroy them. The second, the National Environmental Policy Act, forces the government to consider the environmental impact of any agency action. This became the salient question. The Standing Rock Sioux felt that they were essentially given no opportunity to consult as broadly and expansively as the law requires. In September, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg sided with the pipeline company on that argument. But the environmental-impact question proved thornier. The Army Corps of Engineers never conducted an environmental impact statement for the pipeline, instead approving it under a nationwide permit used only for short water crossings and wetlands preservation. It evidently agrees with the tribe. The Dakota Access pipeline will now be fully judged for its environmental impact. If this all seems complicated and mired in technocratic reasonableness, that's because it is. Yet the federal law is meant to ensure a kind of historical justice. The Standing Rock tribe succeeded because their argument was simple: As a sovereign nation, they had the right to control the integrity of their natural resources. The environmental-impact statement will take about two years to complete; no matter what it finds, it will almost certainly be followed by legal wrangling about what it requires. Because of an earlier Obama administration regulation, the Army Corps must also now consider how the pipeline will worsen climate change. The Trump administration could seek to abort the environmental-impact process, but it might require reaching far into the Department of Defense bureaucracy. The chief of the Army Corps of Engineers is not a political appointee. President-elect Trump supports the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline along the current route. According to multiple reports, he also owns stock in Energy Transfer Partners. He has said this does not affect his policy position. If the Trump administration were to reverse the decision, it might not even evade the same legal wrangling. The Army Corps of Engineers could be sued for arbitrarily reversing a previous agency decision. Energy Transfer Partners could possibly continue drilling under the river and open themselves up to hefty federal fines. In September, the company allegedly continued building the pipeline despite the fact that a federal court was considering an injunction. Even larger questions loom beyond a pipeline in North Dakota. As a rule, indigenous issues do not command mainstream progressive attention in the United States, as they do in Canada, New Zealand, and parts of Latin America. Historians say that the U.S. public has not been so involved in debates about Native rights since the 1960s and 1970s, when disputes over fishing rights in the Pacific Northwest opened a new front in the American civil-rights movement. She continued. There are tribes all over the country that fight off development projects that are harmful to them and their sacred land without this kind of national focus. The remarkable outcome of the Standing Rock protest may let us glimpse the coming years of the American environmental movement. A group of protesters upended their lives to defend the claim that the tribe should have a say over its natural resources. Against the odds and the expectations, the group swelled. It captured the sympathies of millions of people around the country and the globe. Eventually, it awoke the moral imagination of the federal regulatory state. The answer is indisputable. In great numbers, people put their bodies in the way to declare and defend their rights. In so doing, they revealed what legal rights are: not just idle promises, not just nice things to have, but the material guarantee of safe drinking water and community self-determination. In so doing, they forced a moral reckoning within the federal deep state, the multitude of administrators and civil servants who ensure the day-to-day functioning of the United States government.

Keith Kempenich, R-Bowman, would protect drivers from legal consequences if they inadvertently hit, injure or kill pedestrians who are obstructing traffic. The legislation is a direct response to the massive protests around the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, Kempenich said. The ongoing protests have shut down a nearby highway for months and stalled construction of a pipeline that would carry crude from the North Dakota oil patch. The legislation has drawn withering criticism from Standing Rock supporters, who worry that it could be open season for protesters on North Dakota roads. Kempenich said he wants to shift the blame for a crash from drivers to the people who choose to protest in traffic. The legislation, he said, would not protect someone who deliberately tries to run down a protester, and it would not let drivers off the hook if they hit a jaywalker or a child chasing a ball into the street. His bill is one of several floated by protest-weary North Dakota lawmakers this session. One would make it a crime for adults to wear masks. Another would allow the state to sue the federal government over the cost of policing the pipeline standoff. The legislation has several House and Senate cosponsors but has not yet been scheduled for a hearing. Hwy. 1806, which passes through the Standing Rock reservation and beside the drilling site for the stalled Dakota Access Pipeline, has been closed for much of the past year as thousands of people protested the pipeline's proposed path under the Missouri River, just upstream from the reservation, and through tribal burial grounds and cultural sites. The protests have forced North Dakotans to detour for miles. He expects a hearing on his bill soon. In Minnesota, law enforcement steps in to stop or divert traffic when protesters march onto roadways.

For months, members of the Sioux tribe and their supporters have camped out, fighting the pipeline they say could be hazardous and damage the water supply of their reservation nearby. Photo essay: 'Prayers have been answered' Tribal leaders worry the decision to change direction may not be permanent, especially with the incoming Trump administration, as well backers of the pipeline seeking to push the project ahead. Grassroots activists, who have turned the protest site into a mini-city, prepared to withstand freezing temperatures during what was expected to be an even lengthier standoff, were cautious about the scope and durability of their victory. The Army Corps of Engineers said it will not grant a permit to allow the proposed pipeline to cross under the lake. Officials said after discussion with the tribe and Dakota Access it became clear that more work had to be done on the project. The decision comes three weeks after her office announced it was delaying the decision after protests from the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its supporters. Darcy said the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an environmental impact statement with full public input and analysis, delivering both an immediate reprieve and political statement that could aid in future showdowns with President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration. As far as they're concerned, the White House's directive does not change past court decisions to green light the project. North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, a Republican, said last week after a meeting with the transition team that Trump supported completing the 1,172-mile long proposed pipeline, that would transport 470,000 barrels of oil a day across four states. A spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday's decision. id)); This is big-government decision-making at its worst. I look forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us. Opponents ready for next fight The decision by the Corps of Engineers would be useful in a court challenge, according to Jan Hasselman, an Earthjustice staff attorney representing the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. The pipeline protests are at a critical point. This is how we got there. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who actively opposed the pipeline, praised the administration's decision. May Boeve, the executive director leading environmental action group 350.org, celebrated the decision but also sounded a warning against any future plans to reverse it. From threat of removal to celebration Earlier this week, North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple ordered the protesters to leave the campsite by Monday, citing the harsh weather conditions as a reason why they needed to decamp. The US Army Corps of Engineers had warned that come Monday, activists who refused to leave the campsite could be arrested, then backtracked, saying the agency had no plans to forcibly remove those who stay. Instead of backing away, the protesters came out in full force and showed no signs of backing down, even inviting over 2,000 veterans to join their already robust presence. Now with a victory for the Sioux tribe and their supporters, Standing Rock has become a protest symbol.

Mapes Seattle Times environment reporter In a dramatic turnaround, a federal judge has ruled that permits to complete the Dakota Access Pipeline must be reconsidered, and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has demanded the flow of oil through the pipeline be stopped. Completion of the controversial pipeline was stopped by the Obama Administration last December, with a call for an environmental-impact statement to assess risks. Related Ruling on Dakota Access pipeline surprises oil industry President Trump called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to issue the permits, which it did shortly after he took office. Completion of the pipeline swiftly followed, as contractors drilled under a lake formed by a dam on the Missouri River, to hook up the two ends of the pipeline. The flow of oil began June 1. About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects. And here's what we're reading related to the controversy. March 28: What the completed Dakota Access pipeline means for key players. Feb. 22: Preparing to leave, Standing Rock protesters ceremonially burn camp. Feb. 1: Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back. He said the tribe in a status conference before the judge next week will also demand that the flow of oil be stopped while the remand is underway. Hasselman noted the court found three separate violations of legal standards when the Corps issued the permits to complete the pipeline. An analysis of the potential for spills by an outside analyst was not adequately addressed. Finally, the environmental-justice concerns raised by the tribe were also not adequately addressed, nor the highly controversial nature of the project. The tribe argued the pipeline, routed within a half mile of its reservation, puts its water supply in the Missouri River and tribal lands, including sacred sites, unduly at risk. Its fight against the pipeline was joined by tribes from around the Northwest and the nation, as well as opponents from all walks of life from around the globe. Energy Transfer Partners has argued the pipeline is safe and preferable to either tanker trucks or oil trains for the transport of an essential commodity.

But it is a victory with caveats. Most of that run is built on private land. To remedy those violations, the Corps will have to reconsider those sections of its environmental analysis upon remand by the Court. In addition, the judge scolded the Army for giving the go-ahead because the pipeline does not cross reservation land. The Army shrugged off those rules. The previous administration painstakingly considered the impacts of this pipeline and President Trump hastily dismissed these careful environmental considerations in favor of political and personal interests. We applaud the courts for protecting our laws and regulations from undue political influence, and will ask the Court to shut down pipeline operations immediately. We hope this decision leads to the stoppage of oil flowing in the Bakken crude oil pipeline as a permanent remedy to protecting the drinking water of the Cheyenne River and Standing Rock Sioux Nations. But it was grabbed at gunpoint in 1877 by the U.S. government in the wake of the Battle of the Little Big Horn in which the Sioux and their Cheyenne allies delivered a blow to the 7th Cavalry that became a Pyrrhic victory for all seven Sioux bands.

Hundreds of people joined a protest camp for a months-long struggle, which at times became violent against the water protectors and other activists. But the victory was short-lived for the Standing Rock tribe: After taking office in January, President Trump signed an executive order that would help advance construction of the Dakota Access pipeline and the Keystone XL pipeline. The Standing Rock and the Cheyenne River Sioux tribes have been unsuccessful in their attempts to sue the Texas-based company and stop the project. By late February, the makeshift protest camps in Standing Rock were ordered to be evacuated, and the remaining water protectors left the area.

As the story points out, the Ponca have teamed up with White farmers and landowners who are opposed to the project for its forced land grabbing and potential environmental impacts. The concerns for the Keystone XL are similar to what was seen in North Dakota for the Dakota Access Pipeline: land, water and decision-making power. Now, organizers have some solid practice and know what to expect with the Trump administration, which steamrolled both pipelines through presidential memorandums on January 24. And the Keystone XL is a battle activists have won in the past; former President Barack Obama rejected a key permit in November 2015 after seven years of resistance.

Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Chairman Dave Archambault II has asked everyone to leave, but more than a thousand remain, both at All Nations Camp and at the Sacred Stone Camp. Across Cannonball River at the Sacred Stone Camp, owner of the land LaDonna Tamakawastewin Allard said she plans to stay. She calls for help to survive the bitter Dakota winter ahead.

Belle Fourche Pipeline Company manages the pipeline, and it has had a total of 14 leaks in their history in North Dakota. The cold weather has its drawbacks and benefits, he said. Ice slows mobility, but has also trapped much of the oil on top of the creek.

She was ignored, and they walked out, she said. A lot of people wanted to know about North Dakota. She was met with silence. A police officer told her it was time to go. Friends grabbed her arms in support, making it clear they were not going anywhere, Laduke said. Activists yelled at police they should go apply to Morton County. Barrett planned to ask questions about abandoned pipelines, still leaking. The Enbridge pipeline, formerly known as the Sandpiper was routed to cut through Chippewa and Ojibwe treaty territory.

The Dakota Access Pipeline has been built on both sides of Lake Oahe up to the point where Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of the Dakota Access Pipeline, lacks approximately 1,100 feet from the federal government, and about 4,000 feet planned to go under the Missouri River at Lake Oahe. We always, always play by the rules. And he gets it. A 65-day drilling schedule remains to complete the 1,172-mile pipeline, depending on the weather. The pipeline plans to move up to 570,000 of sweet crude Bakken oil through a public utility. Much of the oil will be exported, according to analysts, and will not benefit American consumers. North Dakota politicians including Senator Heidi Heitkamp D-N.D., helped lead efforts to legalize increased exports of liquefied gas and crude oil in 2015. We feel like keeping our head down and doing what we do best, which is put this pipeline in the ground is the best thing we can do. Ramsey attacked live video feeds on social media websites such as Facebook as rumor mills.

Winter is descending upon thousands of Native Americans camped out in North Dakota. For months, they have been protesting against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. The early snowstorms of the season are rolling across the prairie. Temperatures frequently drop below freezing at night. Since April 2016, when the campaign to stop the pipeline began, the indigenous protest camps have transformed into an organised community. The Sacred Stone Camp is dense, close to the Cannonball River, sheltered from the wind by a steep bank and clusters of trees. Oceti Sakowin Camp is sprawling, home to an estimated 4,000 people, huddled around sacred fires, chatting with friends, sheltering from the cold in trucks, tepees, tents and yurts. Image copyright Reuters Image caption The first winter storms blew into the Oceti Sakowin Camp over the Thanksgiving holiday. Doctors, traditional healers and psychologists provide care free of charge in the Oceti Sakowin camp, out of a series of shelters close to the central fire pit. Storage tents, pinned down against the wind with tarpaulins, are piled high with donated gloves, hats and sleeping bags. Many of these developments have been funded by social media campaigns. Although the vast majority of Dakota Access oil pipeline has been built, the section closest to the Standing Rock Sioux reservation - which will pass beneath the Missouri River - is still awaiting federal permits and approval. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Firewood is the primary source of warmth in the camps, which lack electricity or running water. A permit was initially granted by the Army Corps of Engineers, but the Department of Justice and other agencies intervened to override the decision on 9 September. But the struggle between the coalition of over 200 indigenous tribes and the oil company Dakota Access LLC has intensified in recent weeks. On 25 November the US Army Corps of Engineers issued a letter calling for the Oceti Sakowin camp, which sits on federally owned land, be evacuated by 5 December. This was followed by a similar evacuation order from the governor of North Dakota.

The local Morten County police are being sued for excess force by a number of camp residents.

Another Twitter user said they had witnessed a protestor turn down tap water to spend donations on 'fluoride free' water. It says protestors should avoid drugs and alcohol, engage with the elders, and refrain from playing guitars around campfires. The North Dakota Pipeline protest was sparked by plans to construct a 1,170-mile long pipeline which would run across four states. Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, says that it has taken measures to prevent leaks, and that there is no archaeological significance to the area. Standing Rock protests continue: 'Water is life' Thousands of people have been gathering to support the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in their legal battle against the plan. On Saturday activists protesting the continued construction of the pipeline were told to shut down one of their camps by 5 December in a letter sent to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's leader by the Army Corps. However US authorities said on Sunday that they had no plans to forcibly remove activists. The US Army Corps of Engineers, which manages the federal land where the main protest camp is located, said in a statement that anyone who remained would be considered unauthorised and could be subject to various citations. It also said emergency services might not be adequately provided to the area.

Native Americans and activists from around the country have been gathering at the camp for several months trying to halt the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Native American riders listen at an interfaith ceremony at Oceti Sakowin Camp on the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation on December 4, 2016 outside Cannon Ball, North Dakota. The developer of the Dakota Access project, Energy Transfer Partners, and the Army are battling in court over permission for the pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe, a Missouri River reservoir in southern North Dakota. The pipeline rupture spilled about 176,000 gallons of oil, about 130,000 gallons of which flowed into Ash Coulee Creek. A photo released by the North Dakota Department of health shows the creek with a brown muck on it. Another photo shows what appears to be the pipeline break with oil oozing out. As of Wednesday, about 46,000 gallons had been recovered. It appears no oil got into the Little Missouri, and no drinking water sources were threatened, according to Bill Suess, an environmental scientist with the North Dakota Health Department. The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over. The spill was in a remote area of the southwest part of the state, far from any major population centers. It fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. A landowner spotted the spill about 16 miles northwest of the town of Belfield on Dec. 5. The pipeline was shut down as soon as the leak was discovered. Owen said erosion of a hillside might have ruptured the pipe, but the cause is still being investigated. For example, in September 2013, a Tesoro Corp. pipeline break spilled more than 840,000 gallons of oil into a wheat field near the northwestern town of Tioga. That spill is still being cleaned up. True Cos. has a history of spills in North Dakota and Montana, including a January 2015 pipeline break into the Yellowstone River. The 6-inch steel Belle Fourche Pipeline, built in the 1980s, is mostly underground but was built above ground where it crosses Ash Coulee Creek. It is largely complete except for a segment near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, where it would be buried 90 to 115 feet below Lake Oahe. Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners says the line will have modern leak detection equipment, and that workers monitoring the pipeline remotely in Texas could close valves within three minutes if a breach was detected. The pipeline route skirts the northern edge of the Standing Rock Reservation, which straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border. The Standing Rock tribe argues that putting the pipeline under the lake imperils drinking water for more than 8,000 tribal members and millions downstream. ETP and other pipeline advocates maintain that transporting oil through pipelines is safer than shipping it by truck or train. CBS RADIO and EYE Logo TM and Copyright 2016 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

The orders fulfill Trump's campaign promise to approve both pipelines, which have staunch support from the oil industry and the GOP but are strongly opposed by Democrats and environmentalists. The White House did not provide more details. Former President Obama rejected Keystone in November 2015, citing the need to show international leadership on climate change. If fully built by developer TransCanada Corp., Keystone would run from Alberta, Canada, which contains a bulk of that nation's oil sands, to the Gulf Coast in Texas, bringing heavy oil sands petroleum to refineries. Last month, the Obama administration ordered a comprehensive environmental impact statement to be conducted on the Dakota Access pipeline before any decision could be made on building its final section below Lake Oahe in North Dakota. The pipeline has been the subject of international protests that have fired up environmentalists and indigenous rights activists. They say that the pipeline threatens the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, and further development of oil infrastructure threatens the climate.

The three individuals, who include a Native American and a non-indigenous activist, asserted their fifth amendment rights and did not respond to the officers, according to Regan, who declined to identify them to protect their privacy and out of fear of retribution.

Trump, a former investor in Energy Transfer Partners, the Texas-based firm behind the pipeline, took executive action in his first week in office to expedite the project. On Wednesday, workers began drilling to complete the pipeline across the Missouri river. The JTTF revelation comes at a time when there have been increasing concerns at Standing Rock about law enforcement surveillance, police violence and the targeted arrests and prosecutions of activists. Since the summer, law enforcement officials have made roughly 700 arrests, in some cases leading to serious felony charges and possibly lengthy state prison sentences. Following recent indictments, at least six activists are now facing charges in federal court. Rumors about JTTF have caused further stress among the activists. Regan said she was able to confirm the identity of one of the JTTF officers, Andrew Creed, who attempted to contact an activist. In November, a JTTF officer also showed up to the hospital room of Sophia Wilansky, a 21-year-old who was seriously injured during a standoff with law enforcement at Standing Rock, according to her father, Wayne Wilansky. The FBI took her clothes and still have not returned them, he said in an interview this week. Witnesses have said they believe she was hit by a police concussion grenade. The timing of the FBI hospital visit in Minneapolis was upsetting, he added. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Activists at Standing Rock have faced blizzard conditions at the camp during the winter months.

The army corps will undertake an environmental impact statement and look for alternative routes, the tribe said in its own announcement. While the news is a victory, Jan Hasselman, an attorney for the tribe, cautioned that the decision could be appealed. For months, they have protested over their fears that the pipeline would contaminate their water source and destroy sacred sites, and over the weekend hundreds of military veterans arrived at the camps in a show of support for the movement. Sally Jewell, the secretary of the interior, praised the decision. The 1,1720-mile pipeline is slated to carry 470,000 barrels per day from the Bakken oil fields in North Dakota to a refinery in Illinois.

Thousands of opponents who have protested for months have been leaving their main camp in southern North Dakota in recent days due to the work stoppage and severe winter weather. Dalrymple said in a statement that the camp might be vacated by Jan. 1, but Archambault said that's not the case. Some in the camp have said they need until the end of the year to complete their exit, while others plan to stay the winter, he said. An unknown number of others remain in another camp nearby that's run by LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, a protest organizer. Some pipeline opponents fear a federal judge will give ETP permission to finish the project or that the administration of pro-energy President-elect Donald Trump will overturn an Army decision this month not to grant permission for the river crossing. The Associated Press reported Tuesday that according to people with knowledge of the decision former Texas Governor Rick Perry is Trump's choice to lead the Energy Department. Perry is on the board of ETP, although Archambault said that doesn't discourage him. The tribe and its supporters believe the pipeline threatens American Indian cultural sites and the tribe's drinking water, which is drawn from the Missouri. ETP disputes that. Dalrymple and Archambault both said that efforts to normalize relations between the state and tribe rest heavily on reopening a state Highway 1806 bridge right outside the camp. The Backwater Bridge has been closed since being damaged by fire set by protesters in late October. Pipeline opponents think the state is deliberately leaving the bridge closed to block protesters in from the north. Dalrymple said the plan is to enlist the help of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to maintain safety while workers inspect the bridge. Archambault said a timeline wasn't developed during the Monday meeting, which also was attended by other Tribal Council members and s state officials. Also, prosecutor Ladd Erickson said he wants people who have been arrested for protesting against the pipeline to reimburse the state for their court-appointed attorneys.

About 100 to 200 protesters remained after midnight.

Police said they responded by firing volleys of tear gas at protesters in a bid to prevent them from crossing the bridge. Activists at the scene reported on Twitter that police were also spraying protesters with water in sub-freezing temperatures and firing rubber bullets, injuring some in the crowd. A total of 167 demonstrators have been injured according to a medic on site, as cited by Indigenous Rising Media. Seven people have been hospitalized for severe head injuries. Three of those injured are reportedly elders of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Police did not confirm those reports, but later said protesters had hurled rocks, striking one officer, and fired burning logs from slingshots. The North Dakota Department of Transportation closed the Backwater Bridge due to damage from that incident. Completion of the pipeline, set to run 1,172 miles (1,185 km) from North Dakota to Illinois, was delayed in September so federal authorities could re-examine permits required by the Army Corps of Engineers. Plans called for the pipeline to pass under Lake Oahe, a federally owned water source, and to skirt the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation by about half a mile. Most of the construction has otherwise been finished. The Standing Rock tribe and environmental activists say the project would threaten water supplies and sacred Native American sites and ultimately contribute to climate change. Supporters of the pipeline, owned by Energy Transfer Partners, said the project offers the fast and most direct route for bringing Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and would be safer than transporting the oil by road or rail.

The attempt escalated into hours of conflict in which protesters reportedly threw rocks and logs at police, who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and cold water. It was the most tense conflict between law enforcement and opponents of the 1,168-mile crude oil pipeline in weeks, and led to at least 26 serious injuries among protesters, according to a camp medical group, and one officer was reportedly hit in the head with a rock. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier, who said police used fire hoses not water cannons as reported by numerous protesters, said water is not normally used by his department as a method to disperse a crowd. He said field commanders on scene who made the decision to use fire hoses on protesters considered the effect the water would have on people in the cold temperatures. when asked whether the use of force was necessary to keep officers safe. Law enforcement would consider using water again, he said. Kirchmeier said local law enforcement has begun getting federal aid in the form of Customs and Border Patrol officers.

Amnesty International said Monday they would send human rights observes to the pipeline protests, for their fourth visit since August. Treating injuries Michael Knudsen, a member of the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council, was giving medical treatment at the front line of the protest on Sunday night. He said people were suffering mostly from hypothermia, as well as blunt trauma from the rubber bullets and tear gas contamination. Knudsen said ambulances from Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, Kidder and Morton counties were present. According to a release from the medic and healer council, 300 people in total were injured in some form. At least 26 seriously injured people had to be evacuated by ambulance to three area hospitals, according to the release. Sanford Health spokesman Jon Berg said nine people were treated at Sanford but he could not release information on their condition. Cecily Fong, public information officer for the Department of Emergency Services said six were treated at the Fort Yates Hospital. One person was in serious condition at the Hennepin County Medical Center, according to the hospital. Among the most serious injuries were a man who had a seizure, an elder who had to be resuscitated and a woman suffering an eye injury from a rubber bullet to the face, according to the release from the medic and healer council. Protesters criticize the barricade as blocking emergency services and suggest it is being used to prevent access to construction sites just north.

It took six tries to attach and pull the vehicle, during which time law enforcement told them to stop. Protesters started arriving to check on what was happening. From there, officers started firing the rubber bullets and more people gathered on the bridge and across the fields to the sides. This led to the long confrontation with police, in which protesters started fires and allegedly threw rocks and burning logs at officers, according to Kirchmeier.

The Army Corps of Engineers agrees, and has said so publicly and in federal court filings. In spite of consistently stating at every turn that the permit for the crossing of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe granted in July 2016, comported with all legal requirements, including the use of an environmental assessment, rather than an environmental impact statement, the Army Corps now seeks to engage in additional review and analysis of alternative locations for the pipeline. As stated all along, ETP and SXL are fully committed to ensuring that this vital project is brought to completion and fully expect to complete construction of the pipeline without any additional rerouting in and around Lake Oahe. Nothing this Administration has done today changes that in any way. This statement should come as no surprise. Nothing in the Army Corps statement even hinted that the pipeline would not move forward, but the water protectors at Standing Rock have fought and bled to reach even this moment. If they had sat down while the U.S. government and its corporate cronies bulldozed through the blood and bones of their ancestors, they would not be fighting, living to see another day. I salute them. And I salute all who answered their call. Black people in the United States have been fighting these same white supremacist capitalist forces for centuries, but we still fight. We call a win a win even though we haven't won it all. Advertisement Because as I previously reported, this is not over.

His statement reads in part: Today, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that it will not be granting the easement to cross Lake Oahe for the proposed Dakota Access Pipeline. Instead, the Corps will be undertaking an environmental impact statement to look at possible alternative routes. We wholeheartedly support the decision of the administration and commend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama, the Army Corps, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and all of Indian Country will be forever grateful to the Obama Administration for this historic decision. We want to thank everyone who played a role in advocating for this cause. We thank the tribal youth who initiated this movement. We thank the millions of people around the globe who expressed support for our cause. We thank the thousands of people who came to the camps to support us, and the tens of thousands who donated time, talent, and money to our efforts to stand against this pipeline in the name of protecting our water. We especially thank all of the other tribal nations and jurisdictions who stood in solidarity with us, and we stand ready to stand with you if and when your people are in need. Treaties are paramount law and must be respected, and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward. We are not opposed to energy independence, economic development, or national security concerns but we must ensure that these decisions are made with the considerations of our Indigenous peoples. On Friday, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that law enforcement had the full support of the Justice Department, without condemning the violence that water protectors have already faced at their hands. Lynch also suggested that more assistance would be deployed, without specifying what that assistance would look like. As previously reported by The Root, thousands of veterans have traveled to Standing Rock to stand in solidarity. The decision today by the Obama Administration to further postpone any action on the easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline is a serious mistake. It does nothing to resolve the issue, and worst of all it prolongs the serious problems faced by North Dakota law enforcement as they try to maintain public safety. Senator Hoeven, Congressman Cramer and I have repeatedly asked for the easement to be granted and for the pipeline crossing to move forward so that the federal government can bring this to a conclusion. But the Army Corps' decision is a victory that speaks to the unwavering spirit of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. They refused to be silenced and they refused to be moved.

About 1 million barrels a day are currently produced in North Dakota. The more than 800,000 bpd Keystone XL pipeline would bring heavy crude from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The project was conceived nearly a decade ago, but since then the U.S. shale revolution has redefined oil flows, with domestic refiners finding themselves awash with supply and needing fewer imports. Environmental activists campaigned against the Keystone XL pipeline for more than seven years, eventually winning a victory when Obama rejected the project in 2015. TransCanada shares closed up 2.7 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Trump said on Tuesday in Washington that Keystone XL would create 28,000 jobs, but that figure is at odds with a 2014 U.S. State Department environmental study that said the project would create 3,900 construction jobs and 35 permanent jobs. U.S. President Donald Trump holds up a signed executive order to advance construction of the Keystone XL pipeline at the White House in Washington January 24, 2017. The Army Corps earlier this month said it would begin an environmental assessment that could delay the project further.

Instead, Boasberg asked attorneys to appear before him again and make a new set of arguments about whether the pipeline should operate. The tribe faces a mixed result: The ruling may establish some important precedents, particularly around environmental justice and treaty rights. Energy Transfer Partners, which owns and operates the pipeline, did not respond to a request for comment before publication. A representative for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers could not be reached. The Dakota Access pipeline runs 1,100 miles across much of the Great Plains, connecting the Bakken oil formation in North Dakota to a refinery and second pipeline in Illinois. Oil began flowing through the pipeline earlier this month. By late October, Standing Rock had become the largest and most high-profile Native protest in the United States in four decades. First, he said, the Standing Rock Sioux are assured certain hunting and fishing rights in their most recent treaty with the U.S. government. This emphasis on consideration points to the broader nature of the legal fight: This case is not about how the pipeline may harm Standing Rock, but whether the Corps adequately studied and reported on those harms before approving it in the first place. According to federal regulation, every major project constructed near a poor community, community of color, or Native American reservation must be studied on environmental-justice grounds. The Corps shrugged off many of these rules, arguing that no affected group lived within a half-mile of the pipeline route. The Corps was technically correct. The Dakota Access pipeline runs 0.55 miles north of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. The judge ruled that the Corps did not violate administrative law when it quickly approved the pipeline earlier this year. The complicated legal history of the Dakota Access pipeline has stemmed from one important conflict: The pipeline mostly runs across private land, allowing Energy Transfer Partners to quickly secure permission and construct most of it last year. But it also must cross the Missouri River, a federal waterway controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Therefore the dispute at Standing Rock has played out over the last year as the vast majority of the pipeline stood completed and ready for operation. But less than two months later, in early September, the Obama administration stepped in and asked Energy Transfer Partners to voluntarily stop work on the project. President Barack Obama revoked the permit entirely in early December 2016 at the end of that review. His administration also ordered Energy Transfer Partners and the U.S. Army Corps to study whether the pipeline could be re-routed. That study did not last long. The president celebrated the pipeline during a speech last week in Cincinnati. But I took none, actually none. Hasselman referenced the speech as he spoke to me Wednesday. David Archambault III, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, told me last week that while he is not ultimately optimistic about the legal battle, he feels duty-bound to pursue it.

The federal government has been taking land from Lakota and Dakota people for 150 years, tribal leaders say, from the seizure of land in the Black Hills of South Dakota after the discovery of gold in the 1870s to the construction of dams in the Missouri River that flooded villages, timberland and farmland in the Dakotas in the 1950s. Through the ages, the warring tribes of the Northern Plains lived, hunted and fought across a sprawling expanse of land. Many were migratory, moving with the seasons. Each treaty with the U.S. government, most notably the 1851 and 1868 treaties of Fort Laramie, restricted their movement further, although they left them large areas west of the Missouri River and recognized them as sovereign nations. In freezing temperatures, police used water cannons on protesters just north of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota Nov. 20. Land was later taken to make way for homesteading. In 1889, Congress passed legislation that created the modern reservation system, pushing the Sioux, also known as Lakota, into smaller areas. And later in the 1900s, a series of dams across the Missouri River rolled back the scope of those reservations, too. Lake Oahe illustrates his point. The lake, the site of the current dispute, exists because of a dam project built by the Army Corps of Engineers, the same agency that has been weighing whether and where the Dakota Access pipeline could be built. Empowered by the Flood Control Act of 1944, the Army Corps erected the Oahe Dam in central South Dakota, forming a reservoir that extends about 250 miles upstream to within a short distance of Bismarck, N.D. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy dedicated the dam, hailing it as a symbol of a free society tapping its natural resources. It buried them. Caption An encampment has grown near the work site, where security guards face off with demonstrators. The Army Corps simply condemned the land and paid little to no compensation. After building the dam, the Army Corps seized strips of land on either side of the river. Those strips are the areas in dispute now, giving the Army Corps a central role in letting Energy Transfer Partners complete the line, or not. The pipeline battles of the past three months have taken place near the Cannonball. The Standing Rock Sioux are not alone in harboring old grievances, many involving the Army Corps and its dams, Sachse says. The Kinzua Dam in Pennsylvania on the Allegheny River, built in the 1960s, forced more than 600 Seneca families to leave their homes and submerged 10,000 acres of ancestral land. Indians say the project, built by the Army Corps, broke a 1794 treaty signed by President George Washington. The Colville Confederated Tribes sued the government over the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington state, which blocked salmon fishing sites the tribes had used for centuries. In Minnesota this year, the Prairie Island Indian Community bought 112 acres of agricultural land near St. Paul to secure a future home. On its reservation, about 30 miles southeast of the Twin Cities, the tribe has wrestled with flooding from the Mississippi and Vermillion rivers. The reservation has about 3,100 acres of land held in trust by the U.S. government. Located in the 100-year floodplain, the land is unusable for development. Native American disputes are not just history; they are still alive. But the Sioux rejected the money and continue to seek the return of the land. Energy Transfer Partners did not advance its cause when its chief executive, Kelcy Warren, said in an interview on PBS that he wished the tribe had consulted with the company earlier. Nor did Julie Fedorchak, the North Dakota Public Service Commission chair, who told NPR that the Standing Rock Sioux failed to take part in the 11-month permit process or in 30 hours of open hearings, and that their efforts to reach chairman Archambault were futile. Archambault said in an interview with The Washington Post that the tribal council had in fact met with Energy Transfer executives at the tribal headquarters in September 2014 and that the tribal leaders had clearly stated their opposition to the pipeline. Shale oil produced by fracking in western North Dakota is the main source of crude for the Dakota Access pipeline project. Energy Transfer Partners, which on Monday announced a merger with Sunoco in an exchange of shares, had once hoped to keep the Dakota Access pipeline out of the limelight. A natural gas pipeline lies along a similar route. And railroads pose similar hazards. This pipeline, the company says, is just one of hundreds of pipelines that carry crude oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products across the country. The Standing Rock Sioux have raised concerns about a possible pipeline leak in the Missouri River; other pipelines have leaked into rivers over the past five years, including some relatively new ones. The pipeline, he says, is made of extra-thick steel and will run 90 to 115 feet below the bottom of Lake Oahe. But the Native American opposition to the pipeline project runs much deeper than that.

The Bismarck Tribune reported in August that an early proposal for the DAPL planned to cross the Missouri river north of Bismarck, North Dakota instead of near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The U.S. Corps of Army Engineers evaluated the plan and found that the route was too close to Bismarck's well water supply and the homes in the community. The route through Bismarck would have also been 11 miles longer, and passed through more roads and wetlands. In September of 2014 the plan was changed to put the pipeline near the reservation instead, and the Corps issued a permit for that plan, according to the Tribune.

Despite the renewed efforts to remove the Standing Rock protesters, the government (both state and federal) is claiming that there are no plans to forcibly evict demonstrators, and the protesters at Standing Rock have adamantly refused to vacate the area. Early Tuesday, thousands at Standing Rock got devastating and potentially deal-breaking news. According to Herr, the supply lines to the Standing Rock protesters were about to be cut off. Jeff Zent minced no words when he stated that Herr had been mistaken when issuing her threat against the Standing Rock protesters and their supply line.

In September, only 29 percent of total Bakken oil production moved by rail, according to the latest figures from the North Dakota Pipeline Authority. A rise in incidents during the shale boom, and high-profile accidents, such as the explosion in 2013 that killed 47 people in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, has drawn increased scrutiny to the rail industry, prompting the U.S. government to enact more stringent regulations for rail movements. Overall, oil spills more frequently with pipelines than rail cars, according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration (PHMSA). For example, in 2015, there were 252 pipeline spills reported to PHMSA involving crude oil, versus 44 for the rail industry. The year prior, the frequency of spills at pipes was about 62 percent greater than rail, the data shows. The 1,172 mile (1,885 km) Dakota Access Pipeline is slated to run from western North Dakota to Illinois, and has been the subject of protests for months from Native American and environmental activists concerned about leaks and contamination of water supply. Incidents involving crude-by-rail peaked in 2014, at nearly 144, versus just one accident in 2006, the data shows. The rise in accidents followed a surge in volumes moving by rail each day, which hit a high of 29.2 million barrels per month in October 2014. As of September 2016, that had declined to about 10.5 million barrels monthly, according to data from the EIA, as new pipelines displaced rail and production has declined. With lower volumes, train accidents involving crude are down significantly, with only nine reported this year, according to PHMSA data. But that could change. Bakken oil production is expected at 918,000 barrels per day in December - about 70,000 bpd above current pipeline capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A recent deal by OPEC to cut production and stabilize prices could boost drilling activity. In North Dakota, there have been no accidents involving crude rail cars this year, versus six in 2015 and five in 2014, according to PHMSA data. Four spills since 2012 have occurred in Mandan, North Dakota, a city about 40 miles (64 km) north of the proposed route of the Dakota Access pipeline that has been the site of protests.

The Idea is to build on and expand on this context. Whatever your beliefs we can all come together understanding that we are all one, all part of the earth and sky and that when we pray our being moves with the truth of our heart inside those prayers. Let us all stand together united in one peaceful understanding that the water is sacred to all life. Let us all direct our energy to praying for the water, and the water inside us all that creates life. Allow us to understand our part in what we take from the earth and what we give back. As the creator guides us with conscious truth may we all seek our direction with a peaceful heart of the veteran who has seen the pain, frustration, agony and despair of battle and is ready to become one with the earth inside the circle of hope.

The Guardian reports that the leak was quickly contained and cleaned. However, critics of the spill say that the environmental travesty could have been prevented had state officials listened to concerned members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and those who support them. The pipeline was in its final stages of preparing to transport oil when the leak occurred. Activists were forcibly removed from the protest grounds. Pipelines leak and they spill. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which has fought Energy Transfer Partners and the U.S. government in court, argues that the project requires a full environmental study to assess the risks. Because President Trump has financial ties to the oil company, however, it is unlikely such an assessment will be conducted. Standing Rock Sioux tribe chairman Dave Archambault II said the spill is just one more sign the courts should intervene. According to Brian Walsh, an environmental scientist with the South Dakota department of environment and natural resources, this is because the spill was relatively minor as it was caused by a mechanical failure at a surge pump.

Leave a respectful comment. Nation Mar 10, 2017 6:16 PM EDT Despite bitter cold, wind, rain and hail, hundreds of members of Native American tribes and supporters from around the country turned out Friday to march on the White House, in an effort to turn the momentum of the Standing Rock protests into a more sustained movement for native rights. The march and a rally in Lafayette Square across from the White House came after four days of protest, prayer and lobbying on Capitol Hill, where Native communities called for the protection of natural resources and demanded the new administration honor treaties with indigenous peoples. Those issues were drawn into sharp focus last year during the months-long fight over the Dakota Access Pipeline at the Standing Rock reservation. On his fifth day in office, President Donald Trump gave the green light to the Dakota Access Pipeline, as well as the Keystone XL pipeline, which indigenous groups have also protested. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which issues permits for all water crossings, granted a final easement required to complete for the Dakota Access Pipeline last month. The executive order and Army Corps decision was a blow for opponents of the pipeline. But Goldtooth said the momentum from the fight signaled the start of a larger movement. On Friday, indigenous groups were joined by Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, along with celebrities, environmental groups, peace activists, veterans, college students and nonprofits working on First Amendment and LGBT rights. In fall 2016, thousands marched against plans to pass the Dakota Access pipeline under Lake Oahe and near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, North Dakota. Douglas Ryder, 70, a veteran from Durham, N.C. who attended the march, said he was concerned that President Trump was too focused on strengthening the military instead of providing more federal funding for issues like environmental protection. But the community remains wary. Still, he said, he appreciated that people were becoming aware of the issues. The Society of Native Nations has erected a camp there to help stop the pipeline, in collaboration with local communities. Native American leaders are protests at several other pipelines around the country this year. Environmentalists say the Sabal Trail Pipeline could damage the Floridan aquifer system, which provides drinking water to millions of people in the region. Protests over the Sabal Trail Pipeline have already led to dozens of arrests. The march on Friday was about more than just pipelines, however. According to NOAA, Alcoa and General Motors plants dumped toxic pollutants into the Grasse and St. Lawrence rivers around Akwesasne over several decades. Thompson-Oakes said the showdown at Standing Rock encouraged him and White to fight back in their community.

Fonda was taking a new approach to protest the pipeline, fearing it will threaten air and water quality in many states and violate sacred Indian burial sites. For months, Native Americans have been very vocal about shutting the pipeline down. Fonda decided to hit her bank where she hopes it will hurt the most. The two companies that own it and run it, Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco. Her good friend, actress Lily Tomlin, did the same thing two weeks ago, and she's encouraging others to join them. Sixteen other financial institutions are also funding the project. A Wells Fargo spokesperson said the bank is committed to environmental sustainability and to human rights and it hopes all parties involved will work together to reach a peaceful resolution. Just a few weeks ago, the U.S. Army said no to giving the project a permit to bury the pipeline under the Missouri River, but things could change.

And then the incredible happened. On Sunday afternoon, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers legally blocked the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline, denying it a needed easement to drill beneath the Missouri River. It will specifically examine whether the pipeline should be moved or cancelled altogether. Energy Transfer Partners sought to avoid the acrimonious public battles that doomed the Keystone XL pipeline by running the Dakota Access pipeline entirely across private land. This freed the firm from seeking public permits in some states. The status of this treaty remains contested. Since the middle of the 20th century, the U.S. government has sought to allay broken treaties with all Native nations by compensating them for lost land. Since a 1980 Supreme Court decision, the U.S. government more or less officially considers the Sioux treaties to be settled. Energy Transfer Partners could correctly say they were building it on private land, not on the present-day Standing Rock Sioux reservation; but the Sioux could correctly refer to the contested ground as tribal or treaty land, referencing the 1851 agreement. Yet this is not even the principal legal dispute in the Standing Rock case. The first, the National Historic Preservation Act, allows the tribe to identify sacred land or cultural sites before the government allows construction that would destroy them. The second, the National Environmental Policy Act, forces the government to consider the environmental impact of any agency action. This became the salient question. The Standing Rock Sioux felt that they were essentially given no opportunity to consult as broadly and expansively as the law requires. In September, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg sided with the pipeline company on that argument. But the environmental-impact question proved thornier. The Army Corps of Engineers never conducted an environmental impact statement for the pipeline, instead approving it under a nationwide permit used only for short water crossings and wetlands preservation. It evidently agrees with the tribe. The Dakota Access pipeline will now be fully judged for its environmental impact. If this all seems complicated and mired in technocratic reasonableness, that's because it is. Yet the federal law is meant to ensure a kind of historical justice. The Standing Rock tribe succeeded because their argument was simple: As a sovereign nation, they had the right to control the integrity of their natural resources. The environmental-impact statement will take about two years to complete; no matter what it finds, it will almost certainly be followed by legal wrangling about what it requires. Because of an earlier Obama administration regulation, the Army Corps must also now consider how the pipeline will worsen climate change. The Trump administration could seek to abort the environmental-impact process, but it might require reaching far into the Department of Defense bureaucracy. The chief of the Army Corps of Engineers is not a political appointee. President-elect Trump supports the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline along the current route. According to multiple reports, he also owns stock in Energy Transfer Partners. He has said this does not affect his policy position. If the Trump administration were to reverse the decision, it might not even evade the same legal wrangling. The Army Corps of Engineers could be sued for arbitrarily reversing a previous agency decision. Energy Transfer Partners could possibly continue drilling under the river and open themselves up to hefty federal fines. In September, the company allegedly continued building the pipeline despite the fact that a federal court was considering an injunction. Even larger questions loom beyond a pipeline in North Dakota. As a rule, indigenous issues do not command mainstream progressive attention in the United States, as they do in Canada, New Zealand, and parts of Latin America. Historians say that the U.S. public has not been so involved in debates about Native rights since the 1960s and 1970s, when disputes over fishing rights in the Pacific Northwest opened a new front in the American civil-rights movement. She continued. There are tribes all over the country that fight off development projects that are harmful to them and their sacred land without this kind of national focus. The remarkable outcome of the Standing Rock protest may let us glimpse the coming years of the American environmental movement. A group of protesters upended their lives to defend the claim that the tribe should have a say over its natural resources. Against the odds and the expectations, the group swelled. It captured the sympathies of millions of people around the country and the globe. Eventually, it awoke the moral imagination of the federal regulatory state. The answer is indisputable. In great numbers, people put their bodies in the way to declare and defend their rights. In so doing, they revealed what legal rights are: not just idle promises, not just nice things to have, but the material guarantee of safe drinking water and community self-determination. In so doing, they forced a moral reckoning within the federal deep state, the multitude of administrators and civil servants who ensure the day-to-day functioning of the United States government.

All rights reserved. A previously proposed route for the 1,172-mile pipeline had it crossing the Missouri River north of Bismarck, North Dakota, according to a document filed as part of the permitting process. The eventual route that was decided on, and is currently in construction, moved the water crossing of the crude oil pipeline south of the North Dakota capital, to just upstream of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's reservation. The North Dakota Public Service Commission (PSC) refuted allegations of environmental racism, saying that the Bismarck route proposal was never submitted to the agency because permits for it were denied by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during its environmental assessment. This route was never included in the proposed route submitted to the PSC and therefore was never vetted or considered by us during our permitting process. In its environmental assessment, the Corps rejected the Bismarck route to protect wells that serve the municipal water supply, according to The Bismarck Tribune. The Bismarck route would also have been more than 10 miles longer and would have made it difficult to meet PSC requirements to keep the pipeline 500 feet or more away from homes, the Tribune reported. The current route of the pipeline, which the Standing Rock Sioux tribe argues traverses culturally sacred sites and poses a risk to the reservation's water supply, was largely chosen because it runs along existing infrastructure such as railways and other pipelines, Dakota Access argued in its application to the PSC for permits. However, President Obama's comments on a possible reroute come at a time when the pipeline is nearing completion, meaning there may be major hurdles to rerouting it now, according to some experts. The movement to block the pipeline has garnered nationwide support, with hundreds of environmentalists and Native American groups camping out in demonstration near the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. The fate of the controversial pipeline in its current route currently rests with the Army Corps of Engineers, which is reviewing the final easement that Dakota Access needs in order to construct beneath the Missouri River.

The activists, who are demonstrating in sub-zero temperatures, have been ordered to leave the area by Monday. It is unclear if they will obey. The pipeline, which runs close to the Standing Rock Sioux Native American Indian reservation, is nearly complete except for a section running underneath a nearby river. President-elect Donald Trump has said he supports the completion of the pipeline. He has stocks in Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, the project's builder, and Phillips 66, which owns one-quarter of the pipeline. Mr Trump's spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, said she believed he had sold his Energy Transfer Partners stock. The Sioux and other Native Americans began protesting against the pipeline in April.

Mr Dalrymple said he would instead work on rebuilding relations with Sioux leaders. He and the federal government have ordered mandatory evacuations from the protest site.

The decision came just days after President Trump signed an executive order to continue construction of the pipeline, despite months of tense protests in North Dakota, where the pipeline remains unfinished. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, have camped at Standing Rock to stop the building of the 30-inch underground pipeline, which will carry light crude oil. Their main dispute involves a portion that is to be placed under Lake Oahe. When the Army announced it would not grant an easement in December, then-Assistant Army Secretary for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy said the decision was based on a need to look for alternative routes. But in a court filing Tuesday, the US Army Corps of Engineers signaled it was ready to reverse course and get construction of the pipe underway. In a letter to members of Congress delivered Tuesday, the Department of the Army said it was waiving its usual 14-day waiting period from its notice of Congress before issuing the easement. The Army's decision to grant the easement was expected after Trump issued an executive order to continue with construction of the Dakota Access and Keystone pipelines in January. After the executive order was signed, opponents of the pipeline appeared ready for another confrontation. Opponents of the pipeline, however, argue an environmental study of the possible impacts of the pipeline is needed before any construction is begun, which is expected to include a section spanning 1.25 miles under the Missouri River. Amnesty International also criticized the decision to not seek out an environmental study before issuing the easement. Amnesty plans to send human rights observers to the construction site in anticipation of additional protests there. Jan Hasselman, attorney for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, suggested it would continue work to stop the pipeline through the courts. The Standing Rock Tribe is expected to challenge the decision on the grounds that the environmental study was wrongfully terminated, it said.

It poses a battle against a ruling class which established its sway through enslavement of African Americans and genocide against the Native American peoples, and has persecuted them ever since. The 1,172-mile pipeline would cross the Missouri River just north of the current boundaries of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, potentially polluting the water supply to the population in case of a spill. With county sheriffs and state police acting as guard dogs for the oil companies, the standoff quickly became a conflict over Indian rights facing powerful corporations and the racist repressive forces of the capitalist state that does their bidding. In this battle, class-conscious workers and revolutionaries must stand squarely on the side of the Standing Rock Sioux. Now, with winter storms and the election of DAPL investor Donald Trump as U.S. president, the battle continues. The announcement by the U.S. Department of the Army on December 4 that it would not grant the pipeline builders a necessary easement (permit) to drill under Lake Oahe, a dammed section of the Missouri River, was met with elation in the three camps of several thousand Native American and other protesters who had gathered near the site at the mouth of the Cannonball River. They also urged protesters to return home as soon as possible. Other tribe members objected that they did not trust the government and would not leave until the pipeline was definitively stopped. Liberals were jubilant. Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners and Sunoco Logistics, the two main owners of the Dakota Access Pipeline. North Dakota governor Jack Dalrymple, who threatened mass arrests of pipeline protesters, was a Trump campaign energy advisor. An administration of Big Oil and unbridled police power ensures that the battle over Standing Rock will reignite after January 20. It was the vicious repression of protesters that made Standing Rock national news in the first place. A boiling point came in late August when Republican governor Dalrymple declared a state of emergency. On September 3, security guards hired by ETP brutally attacked Indian and other demonstrators at a construction site near the Sacred Stone Camp near Cannon Ball. Vicious dogs were set on the protestors and pepper spray used against demonstrators, including children. TV footage on Democracy Now viewed by more than 13 million people recalled scenes of 1963 police attacks on civil rights marchers in Birmingham, Alabama. The response of the state of North Dakota was to issue a warrant for the arrest of Democracy Now producer Amy Goodman in a blatant attempt to intimidate media coverage. At least seven journalists have been arrested during the protests, deliberately targeted by the county sheriff. Unlicensed security guards hired by ETP used dogs to attack protesters, including women and children. (Getty Images) In response to widespread outrage over the repression, the Obama administration revoked authorization for pipeline construction on federal land on September 9, and asked ETP to temporarily stop building where demonstrations are ongoing. The company refused. A week later, a federal court ordered a brief halt on construction. But on October 9 a federal appeals court denied the request for an injunction. Two weeks later a militarized force of state and local police beefed up with riot cops from Wisconsin, Indiana, South Dakota, Minnesota, Wyoming and Nebraska launched an assault on the 1851 Treaty Camp, trying to drive out protesters. The multi-state police force was assembled under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC), which was signed into law by Democratic president Bill Clinton in 1996. EMAC has been used only twice against protests: first in Baltimore, Maryland following the police murder of Freddie Gray, and now in Standing Rock. The scene was surreal: hundreds of police strung out in a line in the prairie, writing numbers on the arms of arrested protesters and holding them in pens resembling dog kennels; sophisticated police communications vehicles trucked in from hundreds of miles away, and sound cannons blasting away in the middle of vast open spaces. Multi-state police force used LRAD sound cannon mounted atop armored personnel carriers to blast demonstrators with ear-splitting noise. (Rob Wilson Photography) Then at the beginning of Thanksgiving week, cops launched an even more vicious attack on the water protectors at Standing Rock. Protesters were severely injured, including a women who lost the use of her arm after it was nearly blown off, and another who is now blind in one eye after being hit in the face by a tear gas canister. The stage was set for a showdown. Several thousand Native American and other veterans mobilized to converge on Standing Rock to protect the water protectors. But the Corps is viscerally hostile to the Indian population (whose lands they submerged in damming the river and creating Lake Oahe in 1958), and the political echelon of the Pentagon will soon be replaced by a Trump administration that is beholden to the oil companies and an eager proponent of police power. While African Americans, brought here in chains, have had to endure four centuries of oppression, from chattel slavery to Jim Crow segregation and now mass incarceration and wanton police murder, Native Americans subjected to genocide are still under siege over five centuries later. Paramilitary police action against Native American protesters at Standing Rock, North Dakota (November 2016) and to suppress African American upheaval in Baltimore, Maryland (May 2015). A federal judge threw out the racist law. The whole battle over the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock is a blatant case of environmental racism. The original route plotted in May 2014 would have crossed the Missouri ten miles north of the state capital, Bismarck. In fact, objections from Standing Rock about a river crossing a half mile north of the reservation were not even mentioned in the 983 pages of the November 2015 Army Corps Draft Environmental Assessment (written entirely by Dakota Access). So to shorten the route and avoid the need for new easements, the pipeline was routed in the same corridor as the existing Northern Border natural gas pipeline. Protest by Standing Rock Youth at state capitol in Bismarck, North Dakota, 29 October 2016. As the December 5 showdown in Standing Rock loomed, a carload of veterans made the 17-hour drive from Flint to show their solidarity. Serious ecological and environmental issues under capitalism have an often dominant content of class and racial oppression. So to fight off the attacks by a rapacious ruling class, you need a revolutionary program of class struggle. We are not for or against the pipeline, but we support the right of the Dakota Sioux to keep it out. If they objected to a project to grow petunias (or more likely, sunflowers), we would also support the right of a dispossessed Native American people to defend their lands. The call for an immediate end to the production of oil, on the other hand, is a petty-bourgeois anti-working class demand that would shut down industry. Those who raise it should hand over their iPhones, iPads, MacBook Air laptops, air conditioners, and their electric-powered Toyota Priuses (or gas-guzzling SUVs).

Story Continued Below Keystone XL, which was rejected by former President Barack Obama in 2015, has been at the center of one of the largest opposition campaigns in the history of the environmental movement, with activists conducting a years-long effort to kill the project. During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly promised to approve Keystone XL, which would carry Canadian oil sands crude from Alberta to Texas, and he said he wants the U.S. government to get 25 percent of the pipeline's profits. Another of the executive actions signed on Tuesday was aimed at identifying high priority infrastructure projects and speeding the required environmental reviews that Trump blamed for slowing construction of important infrastructure projects. We can't be in an environmental process for 15 years if a bridge is going to be falling down or if a highway is crumbling. That's what it has to do with. Building the Keystone XL pipeline would also be a boon for Trump's friend and early energy adviser Harold Hamm, the founder and CEO of Continental Resources, the oil company that is the biggest oil producer in North Dakota's Bakken field. The pipeline would help transport oil from those wells, which have relied in the past on trains to get the crude to customers. It was not immediately clear if Trump was altering the 2004 George W. Bush administration order that requires a broad inter-agency review of cross-border pipeline projects led by the State Department, but simplifying that process move that would make it easier to approve Keystone. While Trump has long been expected to take steps to approve Keystone, two people familiar with the issue said Trump administration officials have had little communication with the State Department in the runup to the executive actions. One of those people said State did not sign off on the executive actions. Mulvaney defends nanny tax lapse, tangles with Democrats on budget By BEN WEYL and BRENT GRIFFITHS Building Keystone XL faces a number of obstacles. The pipeline is still awaiting approval from Nebraska state regulators for its proposed route, and many landowners in the state are opposed to the project. The planned 1,100-mile Dakota Access pipeline, which would run from North Dakota to Illinois, has also become a focal point of progressive opposition to fossil fuel projects. Native American tribes joined with activists in protests that have occasionally turned violent and caught national attention over the last few months. The Standing Rock Sioux, which has been at the center of the protests because of the threat the tribe says the pipeline poses to its water supply, said Trump's order violates previous agreements they had struck with the federal government. Any move to approve the pipelines will face legal challenges from environmental groups, and Democrats and activists immediately bashed Trump over the pending actions. Jamie Henn, co-founder of the environmental group 350.org, promised that greens will fight Trump. A Trump spokeswoman told reporters last year that he sold his stake in the company. Earlier Tuesday at a meeting with auto industry executives, Trump criticized the sometimes lengthy process required to secure environmental permits required to build infrastructure projects.

The decision came just days after President Trump signed an executive order to continue construction of the pipeline, despite months of tense protests in North Dakota, where the pipeline remains unfinished. Thousands of protesters, including members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, have camped at Standing Rock to stop the building of the 30-inch underground pipeline, which will carry light crude oil. Their main dispute involves a portion that is to be placed under Lake Oahe. When the Army announced it would not grant an easement in December, then-Assistant Army Secretary for Civil Works Jo-Ellen Darcy said the decision was based on a need to look for alternative routes. But in a court filing Tuesday, the US Army Corps of Engineers signaled it was ready to reverse course and get construction of the pipe underway. In a letter to members of Congress delivered Tuesday, the Department of the Army said it was waiving its usual 14-day waiting period from its notice of Congress before issuing the easement. The Army's decision to grant the easement was expected after Trump issued an executive order to continue with construction of the Dakota Access and Keystone pipelines in January. After the executive order was signed, opponents of the pipeline appeared ready for another confrontation. Opponents of the pipeline, however, argue an environmental study of the possible impacts of the pipeline is needed before any construction is begun, which is expected to include a section spanning 1.25 miles under the Missouri River. Amnesty International also criticized the decision to not seek out an environmental study before issuing the easement. Amnesty plans to send human rights observers to the construction site in anticipation of additional protests there. Jan Hasselman, attorney for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, suggested it would continue work to stop the pipeline through the courts. The Standing Rock Tribe is expected to challenge the decision on the grounds that the environmental study was wrongfully terminated, it said.

The U. S. Army Corps of Engineers has set a deadline of Dec. 5 for the eviction of the Oceti Sakowin camp for people protesting the Dakota Access pipeline from corps-owned land. The order comes three days after the Corps told the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe it would close the Corps-managed land north of the Cannonball River on Dec. 5. However, the state does not have plans to remove people from the site, Zent said. A winter storm warning is in effect for the area through Wednesday evening, with heavy snow expected to accumulate to 8 to 13 inches in central North Dakota. Morton County is expected to have winds reaching up to 25 miles per hour on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. Zent noted that while the Corps manages the lands, the state and local authorities are the ones with responsibility for emergency services. Angela Bibens, an attorney who is leading a legal collective at the camp, said during a press conference late Monday that she does not believe the governor has jurisdiction on Corps-managed land. On Sunday, the Corps said it would not forcibly remove people who continue camping north of the Cannonball River after Dec. 5, but activists who choose to stay do so at their own risk. The agency also cited concerns about winter weather and availability of emergency services. The Corps also is encouraging people to move to land identified by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe as a winter camp. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said the announcement from the Corps to close the main protest camp on Dec. 5 came as welcome news, but he continues to seek more help from the federal government. Missouri Valley commissioner 'awkward' over second-round matchup The Army Corps did not answer questions Monday from Forum News Service seeking clarification on how the closure would be enforced. Camp organizers told a news conference on Saturday at the main protest site where about 5,000 people are camped that they had no intention of moving. There are smaller camps on land not subject to the planned restrictions. Kelcy Warren, CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, the parent company of Dakota Access LLC, has made public statements about reimbursing the state for the costs. The 1,172-mile project is mostly complete except for the segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, less than half a mile north of Standing Rock. The company is seeking to get a federal judge to intervene after the Corps announced on Nov. 14 that additional discussion with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is needed before an easement can be issued for the Lake Oahe crossing.

In September, only 29 percent of total Bakken oil production moved by rail, according to the latest figures from the North Dakota Pipeline Authority. A rise in incidents during the shale boom, and high-profile accidents, such as the explosion in 2013 that killed 47 people in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, has drawn increased scrutiny to the rail industry, prompting the U.S. government to enact more stringent regulations for rail movements. Overall, oil spills more frequently with pipelines than rail cars, according to data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Administration (PHMSA). For example, in 2015, there were 252 pipeline spills reported to PHMSA involving crude oil, versus 44 for the rail industry. The year prior, the frequency of spills at pipes was about 62 percent greater than rail, the data shows. The 1,172 mile (1,885 km) Dakota Access Pipeline is slated to run from western North Dakota to Illinois, and has been the subject of protests for months from Native American and environmental activists concerned about leaks and contamination of water supply. Incidents involving crude-by-rail peaked in 2014, at nearly 144, versus just one accident in 2006, the data shows. The rise in accidents followed a surge in volumes moving by rail each day, which hit a high of 29.2 million barrels per month in October 2014. As of September 2016, that had declined to about 10.5 million barrels monthly, according to data from the EIA, as new pipelines displaced rail and production has declined. With lower volumes, train accidents involving crude are down significantly, with only nine reported this year, according to PHMSA data. But that could change. Bakken oil production is expected at 918,000 barrels per day in December - about 70,000 bpd above current pipeline capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A recent deal by OPEC to cut production and stabilize prices could boost drilling activity. In North Dakota, there have been no accidents involving crude rail cars this year, versus six in 2015 and five in 2014, according to PHMSA data. Four spills since 2012 have occurred in Mandan, North Dakota, a city about 40 miles (64 km) north of the proposed route of the Dakota Access pipeline that has been the site of protests.

An announcement in Nebraska is expected on Monday. The pipeline company, TransCanada, said in a statement that the South Dakota leak was detected around 6 a.m. local time on Thursday. The pipeline was shut down, and the cause of the leak was under investigation. The Keystone Pipeline is part of a 2,687-mile system that carries crude oil from Alberta to several points in the United States, including Illinois and Oklahoma. A reporter for The Aberdeen American News at the scene of the spill said on Twitter that the area was blocked off by emergency vehicles. Keystone XL has the strong support of President Trump and most Republican politicians, but it has faced years of vocal opposition in Nebraska from some farmers and ranchers who worry that a spill could spoil their groundwater and decimate agricultural land.

More than a million gallons leaked from a pipeline into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan in 2010, and 50,000 gallons of oil gushed into the Yellowstone River in Montana in 2015, contaminating drinking water there.

ETP's statement in response to the DAPL decision at best promises major pushback to a move made by the sitting president, and at worst implies potential defiance of a major political decision (albeit one that isn't legally-binding).

(Photo: Vicke Kepling) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Alora Lemalu said the temperature was below freezing when authorities began spraying people with water on a bridge near Cannonball, North Dakota, Sunday night. Lemalu, 21, traveled with about a dozen people from Springfield to Standing Rock Sioux Reservation this week to protest the construction of the North Dakota Access oil pipeline. She said both horror and love have shaped her days embedded with a months-long demonstration, which has drawn people from around the world. A few hours later, she was running blindly from a choking cloud of tear gas, surrounded by hundreds of screaming people. The family of a woman hurt by an explosion during the confrontation has said she faces multiple surgeries and could lose an arm. One officer was injured when struck with a rock. As soon as I began running two (tear gas canisters) exploded at my feet. My body was shutting down. My jacket from the tear bombs and coughing & choking. They were actual tear bombs. They exploded like a shotgun blast. but she's glad to be part of the movement. Lemalu, who is indigenous Polynesian, said she traveled to North Dakota to support Native Americans opposing construction of the pipeline near a reservation. The pipeline stretches 1,200 miles across four states. Many are indigenous people from across the United States and even from other countries. She said there is a lot to do and learn. Volunteers are busy prepping food and building or winterizing structures for protesters who plan to stay through the frigid North Dakota winter, Lemalu said. Not all members of the Springfield group camped out. Springfield resident Mindy Spitz, 57, stayed at a hotel about 15 minutes away. Spitz said she's in North Dakota to fight for the environment and against corporate interests. Spitz said she had been watching the developments at Standing Rock since September and felt like signing petitions online and posting on social media was not enough. Spitz was not at the skirmish Sunday night, but she said she opened her hotel room to be used as a shower station for protesters who had been tear-gased. Spitz said one member of the Springfield group was hit by three rubber bullets, leaving deep bruises, and at least four others were tear-gased. Protesters, some from Springfield, clashed with law enforcement near Cannonball, N.D., Sunday November 20, 2016. It felt like it was war. She said she will continue to speak out.

The Dakota Access Pipeline is an underground oil pipeline from northwest North Dakota to southern Illinois. The Meskwaki, Standing Rock Sioux and the Cheyenne River Sioux tribes have opposed the project, saying it threatens their water supply and tribal burial grounds. While the Obama administration had withheld permission for the project, President Donald Trump signed a presidential memorandum advancing its approval. The Army Corps of Engineers has since granted Dakota Access the easement to cross federally-owned land, saying the project is safe and will not affect water quality.

The spill, near Amherst, S.D., comes just days before regulators in neighboring Nebraska decide whether to grant the final permit needed to begin construction on a different pipeline proposal, the Keystone XL, which would be operated by the same company. An announcement in Nebraska is expected on Monday. The pipeline company, TransCanada, said in a statement that the South Dakota leak was detected around 6 a.m. local time on Thursday. The pipeline was shut down, and the cause of the leak was under investigation. The Keystone Pipeline is part of a 2,687-mile system that carries crude oil from Alberta to several points in the United States, including Illinois and Oklahoma. A reporter for The Aberdeen American News at the scene of the spill said on Twitter that the area was blocked off by emergency vehicles. Keystone XL has the strong support of President Trump and most Republican politicians, but it has faced years of vocal opposition in Nebraska from some farmers and ranchers who worry that a spill could spoil their groundwater and decimate agricultural land. Ms. Crumly and about 90 other Nebraska landowners have not signed easements with TransCanada and have urged against issuing a permit for the project. More than a million gallons leaked from a pipeline into the Kalamazoo River in Michigan in 2010, and 50,000 gallons of oil gushed into the Yellowstone River in Montana in 2015, contaminating drinking water there. Oil pipelines have faced greater scrutiny since thousands of protesters gathered near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota last year to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline. Ms. McIntosh, the South Dakota environmental official, said that TransCanada employees and contractors were at the spill site and that soil cleanup workers were on the way.

That victory, gained with support from tribes across the Northwest, was a spark that helped inspire and encourage opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota. Leaders of the Tulalip, Spokane and Yakama Nations also joined the celebration, which featured clam chowder, fresh crabs, oysters and salmon, all caught by Lummi fishermen from local waters. Fire-roasted on sticks, the fish was succulent, crimson and delicious like no other food, just one reason for the joy in the hall. Children and youth in traditional regalia performed tribal dances as tribal members cracked open steamed crab legs. Tim Ballew, chairman of the Lummi Nation, took in the scene. Washington tribes are fighting fossil-fuel projects around the state to preserve fisheries and sacred sites. The hope expressed now among many here was that the victory would stick at Standing Rock, hard won by thousands of opponents encamped by the Cannonball River near the proposed river crossing, now in bitter cold. Energy Transfer Partners on Monday issued a statement vowing to complete the pipeline project, in the same crossing area, basically as if nothing had ever happened. But no drilling is going on, according to law-enforcement officials in North Dakota. The work that remains is major. Whether that will ever happen, or where, is now under a new round of consideration. If the new president seeks to cancel the environmental review, the tribe will go to court to insist on it. Many tribal leaders addressed the crowd first in their native language. Without these we cease to exist as a people. As we are able to shoot these fossil-fuel proposals down, they will rise again.

The tribe is fighting the completion of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which it says will endanger the drinking water of the tribe and millions of people downstream. The tribe also says sacred sites have been destroyed in construction and remain at risk if the project continues. He reiterated his call for President Obama to stop the project and deny an easement Dakota Access needs to compete the oil pipeline. Vowing to stay, many demonstrators had begun winterizing their camps. By some estimates there are as many as 5,000 people in the Oceti Sakowin camp, named for the Seven Council Fires of the Sioux, at this time. Numbers have fluctuated up and down throughout the resistance to the project. Campers can move to the new area provided by the Corps, wrote John W. Henderson, commander for the Omaha district. Archambault pushed back, stating that the best way to protect public safety is to deny completion of the project as the tribe has been insisting since it was presented to the tribal council in 2014. It has by now built the pipeline all the way to the edges of the easement it needs from the Corps of Engineers. The pipeline is planned from Bakken oil fields of North Dakota to Illinois, where it would tie in with an existing pipeline to refineries in the Midwest and on the Gulf coast. The project was never examined under an environmental impact review but instead was approved under a fast-track process that three federal agencies have stated was not adequate.

The Two-Way Dakota Access Pipeline Court Challenge Denied, Oil Could Flow As Soon As Next Week According to a website set up by march organizers, the goal of the demonstrations is to highlight the responsibility of the federal government to respect tribal sovereignty. Since the Dakota Access Pipeline route near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation was approved in July 2016, tribal leaders have argued in public statements and court filings that their concerns about the pipeline were not adequately considered by the federal government. The march comes days after the latest legal setback for the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, who are suing the Army Corps and the company building the Dakota Access Pipeline. On Tuesday, a federal judge denied a motion by the tribes to halt final construction of the portion of the pipeline that runs under part of the Missouri River called Lake Oahe.

Still, the decision to deny the easement tempers some of the optimism pipeline companies assumed following the election of Trump, who is seen as more supportive of oil and gas projects. Energy Transfer Partners said in a statement the decision was politically motivated and it did not intend to reroute the line. Last week Trump for the first time voiced support for the Dakota Access project. Denying permits for an already-approved pipeline adds a new level of uncertainty to projects. Oil companies have already been facing growing resistance from environmental groups that have resulted in delays or unanticipated costs. Equipment used for the Dakota Access line has been set on fire, and in October, a group of protesters turned off valves on pipelines transporting oil from Canada to the United States. Together, those lines had capacity to move some 2.8 million barrels per day of oil. That means pipelines could face higher risk premiums and have a harder time getting volume commitments from shippers that underpin such projects, Ozkan said. While the Standing Rock Sioux have said they would support a rerouting of the line, others, such as the Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN), want it canceled.

The Corps further stated that it plans to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for alternative routes. These actions trigger a new round of public involvement processes to permit the final piece of the pipeline as required by the National Environmental Policy Act. The decision is major victory for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and all who stood in solidarity over the last few months. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, represented by Earthjustice, brought a lawsuit against the Corps for its approvals for the pipeline in July of this year. The lawsuit claimed that the Corps violated multiple environmental and historic preservation statutes, focusing on the decision to reroute the pipeline from Bismarck, North Dakota to the doorstep of the Standing Rock reservation without an adequate environmental analysis and consultation. At various times, pipeline construction has been subject to court injunctions due to the litigation. The Corps granted permits for the pipeline in July 2016 under a highly streamlined approval process known as Nationwide Permitting. The process circumvents any kind of close environmental review and public process. It was this easement that the government confirmed would not be granted.

The standoff threatens to further escalate. Activists and tribes protesting plans to run the Dakota Access oil pipeline under a lake near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation in North Dakota said Saturday they would not leave the main protest camp after the government issued a directive for them to vacate the site. Those who remain at the camp could face prosecution. Protest organizers said Saturday at a press conference that they plan to stand their ground. Archambault said the tribe is also working to find a location on reservation land in case protesters decide to move there. Protesters needed to move: state government North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said in a statement on Saturday that it was the federal government's responsibility to close the camp because the government had allowed it to grow. Republican Senator John Hoeven and Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp also said the protesters needed to move for public safety. The main camp has turned into a sprawling village with semi-permanent structures, motor homes and trailers, as preparations are made to hold out over the freezing winter. Since the protests began in August, more than 400 people have been arrested as tensions rise between protestors and police. The Dakota Access pipeline would carry Bakken shale oil from North Dakota to Illinois, where it can be moved to US Gulf Coast oil refineries. Most of the 1,886-kilometer long (1,712 miles) pipeline is complete except for a section planned to run under Lake Oahe, a little more than half a kilometer from the Standing Rock reservation. The government and Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners, which owns the project, argue the pipeline would carry oil more cheaply and safely than already overburdened rail routes. Protesters say the pipeline is a threat to water resources and Native American sites. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe says that when those behind the pipeline approved the route, they failed to take into account tribal opposition. They demand the route be diverted away from their ancestral and treaty lands. In September, the government postponed final approval of the permit to build the pipeline under the lake in order to give federal officials more time to consult with the tribe. Earlier this month, President Barack Obama said the pipeline could be rerouted, but Energy Transfer Partners is opposed to the idea."}, {"URL": "https://www.buzzfeed.com/jimdalrympleii/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-dakota-oil-pipeline-and-the?utm_term=.fn33kkq8J#.eg5N22XdJ", "Timestamp": "20180918233302", "Sentences": "Facebook Twitter youtube Trending What You Need To Know About The Dakota Oil Pipeline And The Native Americans Trying To Stop It The pipeline would transport millions of gallons of crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois each day.

In his first three weeks in office, President Donald Trump bucked norms about executive propriety and canceled an environmental-impact review ordered by the Obama administration. Normally, any easement issued by the federal government would require a two-week waiting period, but this time the Army Corps specifically waived that pause. So in what will likely be their final attempt to block the mega-infrastructure project, the local Sioux tribes have reached for a new, emergency legal argument: They allege that the pipeline will harm their First Amendment rights. The tribes argue that their religion depends on the purity and sanctity of the water of Lake Oahe, and that the pipeline could permanently harm this water. As the Army Corps has previously considered moving the pipeline, the Sioux say that it is not an onerous request for them to move it now, out of religious concerns. But RFRA originally emerged out of concern for the sovereignty of Native American tribes and nations. In 1990, the Supreme Court ruled that Oregon was within its rights to fire two Native American employees after they failed a drug test for mescaline. This ruling, combined with other cases where Native groups alleged that federal infrastructure projects violated sacred land, prompted the initial passage of RFRA. The problem he identifies comes back to an old, familiar one for the tribe: While the pipeline crosses land that was granted to the Sioux under the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie, the land was later stolen from the tribe, and the tribe can make no modern-day property claim. The tribe threads this needle by saying that the waters of Lake Oahe are held by the federal government in trust to the tribe. Were the pipeline to leak, the United States would abrogate this duty. The brief makes one more important argument. Under Hobby Lobby, the courts have to be careful not to inquire too much into the sincerity of any religious claim. But Laycock said it is unlikely to matter. In its quest to block the Dakota Access pipeline, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has reached for one federal statute after another. Over the summer, it argued the pipeline violated its rights to a historic review under the National Historic Preservation Act. Throughout the fall, it sought an environmental-review statement required under the National Environmental Policy Act. The Obama administration granted it just such a review in early December. But that decision was vacated in the first days of the Trump administration. On Thursday, a former Cabinet secretary to President Obama condemned this decision. And therein lies the final problem for the Standing Rock Sioux. We want to hear what you think about this article.

The demonstration against the pipeline's construction has been going on for months, with clashes between peaceful protesters and the police frequently turning violent. The Flint water crisis, meanwhile, stretches back over two years. The city was supposed to start sourcing water from Lake Huron in 2013, rather than purchasing it from Detroit, but doing so required the construction of a pipeline. Detroit cut off Flint's water supply ahead of schedule, forcing the city to look to the Flint River, the waters of which corroded the lead pipes that brought it to residents. As a result, the water that people were drinking was not only poisoned, but also rife with disease-causing bacteria. President Barack Obama followed suit in January as well. Veterans and activists do not know exactly when they'll head to Flint and many have vowed to stay until the Standing Rock Sioux ask them to leave.

Perry sits on the board of directors for Energy Transfer Partners, the firm behind the pipeline. Though he comes from a business background, Viola doesn't come with similar baggage or preconceptions about pipelines. At the same time, he doesn't have any experience with Indian Country either and the Army Corps' handling of Dakota Access has been seen as a failure of its tribal policy. Separate from the pending environmental review, the Army Corps has to defend itself from a cross-claim filed by the wealthy backers of Dakota Access. The firm argues that it has a right to drill under the Missouri River, less than a half-mile north of Standing Rock, despite lacking the easement that was denied this month. The agency is facing a January 6, 2017, deadline -- before Trump is sworn into office -- to submit crucial papers in court on the issue. The Department of Justice, which will soon be under new leadership, plans to contest the cross-claim, an attorney said at a December 9 hearing in D.C. Judge James E. Boasberg agreed to the request as he prepares for a hearing in early February on the easement. By that time, though, Trump will be in office. Beyond the legal and political realms, the new Trump administration will have to face the public, which has rallied behind Indian Country in its effort to stop the pipeline from crossing the Missouri River. We will not stop. A string of brutal winter storms has prompted many to leave, with promises to return once conditions improve. Earlier this month, the population there swelled to 10,000 with the arrival of nearly 4,000 veterans and other supporters. During the late summer and early fall, anywhere between 5,000 to 7,000 people were regular visitors and workers to the camps, located on land promised to the Sioux Nation by treaty.

Protesters say a leak in the Dakota Access pipeline, which Trump just advanced, could be a 'death sentence' Erin Brodwin Jan. 25, 2017, 11:05 AM createPerformanceMark('first image displayed'); A woman stands in front of the North Dakota capitol building. In December, the US Army Corps of Engineers rejected the permit that the project needed for its completion. But on Tuesday, Trump signed a series of directives aimed at speeding up the pipeline's approval process. Those reviews are seen by many government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as environmentalists, as cornerstones to ensuring the environment is taken into account when new construction projects are ordered. The project is a proposed 1,172-mile pipe that would shuttle half a million barrels of North Dakota-produced oil to refining markets in Illinois. Proponents of the pipeline say it would lessen dependence on foreign oil while creating jobs and growing domestic industry. As proposed, the pipeline would pass through North Dakota's Lake Oahe, a burial site sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux and a major source of drinking water for the community. But as I reported in December, it may have been too early to celebrate. Here's why environmentalists and people who live and work near the proposed pipeline are so concerned. Contaminated water is a massive health problem Should the Dakota Access pipeline leak or burst, the effects could be devastating. And leak pipelines do. An average of 121 accidents happened in both 2013 and 2014. In addition, people who had used contaminated water for bathing or laundry appeared to experience more skin problems, ranging from mild rashes to severe and lasting eczema and malignant skin cancers. Passed in 1970, NEPA basically ensures that the government considers the potential environmental effects of any federal project, like a new highway or airport, before building it. The Standing Rock Sioux say that the Dakota Access pipeline's review process was not done properly. In a lawsuit it filed in July against the Army Corps of Engineers, the tribe said the permit process was rushed and undertaken largely without its input. If the pipeline were to leak or burst, it would send oil deep into the Missouri River, the Standing Rock Sioux's primary source of water, which the tribe relies on for everything from bathing to drinking. For that reason, the tribe says the Army Corps of Engineers could violate not just one, but two laws: NEPA and the Clean Water Act. Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, waits to speak against the Dakota Access oil pipeline during the Human Rights Council at the UN in Geneva, Switzerland, on September 20. Trump also owned stock in Energy Transfer Partners, according to his most recent filing with the Federal Election Commission, The New York Times reported on Tuesday. The Times added that a Trump spokesperson said last month that Trump had sold all of his stock during the summer, yet Trump has failed to provide any documentation proving the sale. Signs left by Dakota Access pipeline protesters near the Standing Rock reservation in Cannon Ball, North Dakota. But as Bill McKibben wrote in The New Yorker, officials rerouted it when people there raised concerns that it could jeopardize the community's water supply.

Protesters in North Dakota have said the pipeline will threaten the land near the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says the pipeline, part of which would run under the Missouri River, could affect the tribe's drinking water supply and put communities downstream at risk of contamination from crude oil leaks and spills. More than 400 people protesting the pipeline in North Dakota clashed with police Sunday on a bridge north of a protest camp near the Standing Rock reservation. Tear gas, rubber bullets and a water cannon were used on protesters Sunday night. Van Den Abbeele and other speakers encouraged those at the UCI rally to learn how to organize demonstrations peacefully and to protect their right to assembly and free speech. The rally came together after Ben Garceau, a lecturer in the UCI School of Humanities, returned this month from a four-day trip to Standing Rock, where he said he saw people being pepper-sprayed and doused with water in freezing weather. Garceau said he helped organize the rally with the University Council-American Federation of Teachers local and UCI's American Indian Resource Program, which offers support services for tribal students. Petition seeks sanctuary campus Many UCI staff, faculty and alumni have signed an online petition seeking to make the institution a sanctuary campus to help protect undocumented students. As of Monday morning, the petition had 966 signatures. The action is part of a trend in which petitions and protests at universities nationwide are calling for the schools to become sanctuary campuses in response to President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Columbia University Provost John Coatsworth described in an email Monday the New York institution's plan to withhold undocumented students' information from immigration officials without a subpoena, prevent immigration officials from entering the campus without a warrant and provide more financial aid for such students if Trump decides to repeal a federal law that shields undocumented students from deportation."}, {"URL": "https://www.rt.com/usa/381289-federal-appeals-court-refuses-to/", "Timestamp": "20180919004130", "Sentences": "On Wednesday, the legal team representing the two tribes asked the appeals court for an emergency order which would halt any further construction progress.

The decision to seek an emergency order comes after both Native American tribes lost a legal bid last week to stop construction on the last link, which runs under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. The Army Corps of Engineers was allocated the task of clearing the way for the pipeline to run under Lake Oahe on February 7, which the tribes and environmental activists tried to stop with all legal means available at their disposal. In their legal argument, the Native American tribes claimed that the pipeline under Lake Oahe would desecrate water used in sacred ceremonies. Environmental groups along with the local tribes continue to oppose the pipeline, which is being constructed by Energy Transfer Partners, saying it could pose a threat to their drinking water supply.

On Sunday, demonstrators set up a new camp, called Winter Camp, in the pathway of pipeline construction, on what they consider unceded territory belonging to them under the 1851 Laramie Treaty. Police said on Wednesday that they are prepared to carry out that threat. Journalists were also arrested, and had their equipment confiscated. Video footage showed people standing together, backing up as police approached. On Sunday, the Morton County Sheriff called for additional law-enforcement personnel from outside North Dakota. State and local officials also requested, and received, temporary flight restrictions from the Federal Aviation Administration in a seven-mile radius around the protest camps, which may be an attempt to keep away news helicopters, as it was during the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri. And they need to be commensurate with the crime. The department has repeatedly emphasized that protesters are violent, though there is little evidence to back up its claim. In September, for instance, Kirchmeier spread a rumor that demonstrators were threatening to use pipe bombs against officers. She said the response from North Dakota officials fits a pattern of increasing militarization of law enforcement across the country, but that it also echoes a long history of official, state-sanctioned violence against indigenous people. Law enforcement officials have said that they are only responding to illegal activity on private property. It took nearly two months for them to reach that conclusion.

Lily Herman Feb 21, 2017 2:53PM EST Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest facebook dialog Pinterest Scott Olson Demonstrators have been camping out at Standing Rock in North Dakota for months to protest the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline , but now that President Donald Trump has signed an executive order allowing for its completion and the Army Corps of Engineers has been ordered by acting secretary of the army Robert Speer to finish construction, indigenous women at the camp are putting out a direct call for help to the public, asking people to join them at the camp to stop law enforcement from closing in. Earlier this month, a federal judge from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., denied a legal request from the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline through their lands, arguing that the construction itself wasn't bringing harm to either tribe. The judge did, however, schedule a longer hearing for February 27 to discuss the impact of the project on Native American communities in the area once oil begins to flow through the pipeline, reported the Associated Press. Despite the ongoing legal battle, The Intercept reported that construction has already restarted, and oil could be going through the Dakota Access Pipeline within the next 30 days. Because of the restart of construction, women at the Oceti Sakowin camp at Standing Rock are making a call for protesters and media to join them in protecting the camp as law enforcement officials continue to surround the site. People at the camp were notified on February 15 by North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum and the Bureau of Indian Affairs that their site needs to be cleared by Wednesday, February 22. If they aren't out of the camp by then, the women say in the video, they could face arrest, federal charges, and prison time.

The objections raised by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and its allies to the Dakota Access Pipeline have captured the attention of indigenous activists and climate-change campaigners from across the country and around the world; and the corporate interests that are seeking to complete the pipeline have made little secret of their frustration with the protests. Now state officials are telling members of the tribe that they must leave. The Army Corps of Engineers has announced plans to take steps on December 5 to close off access to the camp. Authorities have used mass arrests, rubber bullets, pepper spray, and water cannons to deter protests. They have also arrested journalists and documentary filmmakers seeking to report from the scene. Earlier this year, Gabbard broke with Democratic Party leaders to support the insurgent presidential campaign of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, another critic of the 1,170-mile Dakota Access Pipeline.

Trump's executive action On December 5, protesters celebrated after the US Army Corps of Engineers announced plans to find an alternative route for the pipeline. But just a few weeks ago, President Donald Trump signed executive actions to continue construction of the pipeline. On Tuesday, the Corps of Engineers notified Congress of its intent to grant an easement for the project, allowing it to move closer toward completion. id)); Signing orders to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines in the Oval Office. Michael Wood Jr., founder of Veterans Stand, said new efforts are more focused on supporting the camps in any way possible. People want to do something and they just don't know what to do. Anthony Diggs, the secretary of communications for Veterans Stand, says protesters are still hopeful. Looking forward Environmentalists, local residents and indigenous tribes say the pipeline's proposed route would cut across the Ogallala Aquifer, which is one of the world's largest and the main source of drinking water and irrigation for millions of people. Tribe members, veterans and their supporters have been protesting its construction since last summer because it would traverse sacred Sioux land and has the potential to contaminate the water supply, and raises other potential environmental issues.

However, at Standing Rock in North Dakota, Indians from all over North America have been protesting for seven months in some ways never before seen. Protest in this case is related to process. Part of the process was for the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the agency that approved the pipeline, to consult with tribes about how the pipeline would affect their reservations and treaty lands, sacred sites and cultural areas. According to documents filed in federal court, the Corps did just that numerous times. In response, officials adjusted the pipeline route. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe chose not to fully engage with pipeline officials until late in the process. The legal and ethical argument is about tribal sovereignty and the protection of natural resources. There is nothing new about such issues. However, what is novel is that the tribe and the outside protesters are working together. The Standing Rock reservation set up a protest camp and made a stand with the protesters. What also makes this Indian protest different from others is its manner and its reach. Theirs is a nonviolent protest that is speaking broadly, in such a way that non-Indians can see that these environmental and policy concerns affect them, too. An overwhelming number of them are women. This all stands in contrast to the American Indian Movement, which flourished in the early 1970s, culminating in the takeover of the Wounded Knee trading post on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota and the shootout with federal agents nearby. That movement had few specific aims, a violent tendency and little non-Indian support. The Standing Rock protesters are making the argument that the pipeline threatens not just tribal land and resources but American land and resources. The protesters are making a stand on behalf of all Americans for better decisions for our energy future. This is their sacrifice and this is their new Thanksgiving gift. A non-Indian friend asked me recently, in response to protests about Indian mascots for sports teams, where is our Rev. We Indians are a plurality. There are more than 500 tribes in the United States and we all have different cultures, histories, landscapes and ways of organizing politically. We are united by the legacy, and current practices, of colonialism. Like African-Americans, we have fought for and won some of our civil rights. But we have always fought for something quite different from that, too. We have fought for the recognition that we are American and Indian, and that as Indians we belong to sovereign nations and have treaty rights that have always been our rights. We do not have, like the African-American civil rights movement, a single institution like slavery to define our struggle, and a hard date when that was to have ended. But the protest at Standing Rock does have something Dr. King possessed, and that is dignity in the face of dire opposition. We also have the same kind of ecclesiastical calling, a call from God or the spirits, to not only ennoble ourselves through protest but to ennoble the democratic republic that seeks to diminish us. There is something inside the protest to ponder. And it is grave. We have seen water protectors maced, arrested and fired upon with rubber bullets. David Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux, wrote in The New York Times that this is proof that government, once again, is against us. That it is once again cowboys versus Indians. There is, of course, a history of conflict. This is ever more clear in the violent backlash against protesters in recent days. But to say that the story of the Dakota Access Pipeline is another iteration of that old western story is to repeat the mistakes of past protests and movements. We situate ourselves in a position of powerlessness. It absolves us of our own complicity in how the world of power around us has been shaped. It absolves our tribal leaders of their reluctance to show up for meetings and to fight diligently and thanklessly in the trenches of numb process. We have to show up to get up. Neither is irony. The civil rights movement got results not just because activists marched in the street but also because activists marched into classrooms, county board meetings, law schools and the voting booth.

In a short period of two days, the picture changed dramatically. But with the increased funds, Wood Jr. says, the group will be able to afford more equipment and supplies to aid them in their three-day mission, which will culminate in an attempt to break through the line of guards protecting the Dakota Access construction site. The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which spans the border of North and South Dakota and is home to members of the Lakota and Dakota nations (known collectively as Sioux), has been the site of an increasingly tense standoff between law enforcement-backed security contractors and activists since July, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved a plan to build one of the final segments of the 1,170-mile Dakota Access Pipeline on land adjacent to the reservation, sparking a massive protest that has drawn activists from as far as Israel, Russia, and Japan. According to the Standing Rock Sioux, the planned route, which will cross beneath the Missouri River, will threaten their drinking water supply and destroy sacred sites and burial grounds located on land that the government stripped from the Sioux in the past. Veterans For Standing Rock is headed to the area at a time when the situation on the ground appears to be growing increasingly chaotic. On Nov. 20, a 10-hour standoff between demonstrators and the police resulted in 300 people injured, according to the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. Previous claims of excessive police force recently prompted the United Nations to launch an investigation of potential human rights abuses. In addition to concussion grenades, security contractors and law enforcement have repelled activists, often numbering in the hundreds, with pepper-spray, fire hoses, batons, dogs, and rubber bullets. I am extremely happy to be stressed out right now, trying to make this as soon as possible. Of course, more boots on the ground means more opportunities for people to get hurt. So far, it appears that the most violent episodes of the standoff have occurred when the demonstrators confronted the guards in overwhelming numbers. Wood Jr. points out that the violent efforts by law enforcement to dislodge the protesters merely prove his point that they have abrogated their responsibility to protect and serve the public, acting instead on behalf of private corporate interests.

But no matter what happens in North Dakota, activist leaders say they plan to channel the energy generated in Standing Rock to oppose a wide range of fossil fuel projects in development across the country. Exactly which fight will come next is hard to know. Activists say they will look to target projects where they can build large coalitions like the one on the ground in North Dakota with organizers devoted to addressing climate change, indigenous rights and environmental justice all working together. The attention surrounding Standing Rock comes at a time of when activists will be facing new challenges, most importantly at the federal level when President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Trump has promised to undo oil and gas regulations and will almost certainly take a more antagonistic attitude toward the environmental community than President Obama. He even owns stock in Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the Dakota Access pipeline. Some activists say they remain optimistic that Trump will tread carefully on the Dakota Access project precisely because of his own financial stake in the pipeline. Interfering in the pipeline would look bad, even for a politician who has shown little concern with mixing his private interests with official business, and Trump should expect a backlash if he pushes fossil fuel development too hard from the outset of his presidency, activists say. But even if the Dakota Access Pipeline is completed, leaders say the opposition will have had a positive impact. Several federal agencies acknowledged that they need to do a better job consulting with tribes before approving such projects in the future. Instead, they say they will calibrate their efforts to succeed despite an opposing administration. Attention will likely turn to stopping state permits rather than federal ones. Even in conservative states a coalition of indigenous people, environmental activists and landowners can pack a potent punch, activists say. Pipeline fights rooted in property rights in particular has already delivered some victories for pipeline opponents like in South Carolina where the legislature passed a law that effectively halted construction on the Palmetto Pipeline in that state earlier this year. Even with Keystone XL, a group of landowners in Nebraska had sued to stop the pipeline in their backyard before Obama rejected the project. More than 300 tribes are represented at the Dakota Access Pipeline protest all in support of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Local tribes in both places say the projects threaten their wellbeing and contribute to man-made climate change to an unhealthy degree. Before the next Dakota Access Pipeline pops up activists may need to gear up to revisit the old battle over the Keystone XL. President Obama rejected the pipeline last year, but Trump says approving it will be a priority on his agenda for his first 100 days in office. Activists promise not to stand idle if and when he tries to follow through on the campaign commitment. All Rights Reserved.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said on Sunday it turned down a permit for a controversial pipeline project running through North Dakota, in a victory for Native Americans and climate activists who have protested against the project for several months. A celebration erupted at the main protest camp in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, where the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and others have been protesting the 1,172-mile (1,885-km) Dakota Access Pipeline for months. The line, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP, had been complete except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. That stretch required an easement from federal authorities, which delayed a decision on the permit twice, in an effort to consult further with the tribe. In a statement, Standing Rock Chairman Dave Archambault II thanked activists for their support in the protest effort. It is unclear what the pipeline route will be, however, and any route would still likely need to cross the Missouri River, probably upstream of Lake Oahe and closer to the state capital of Bismarck. Many pipelines travel under U.S. waterways already, and pipe is considered a safer way to transport crude oil than rail. This is big-government decision-making at its worst.

Proponents of the pipeline say that it will help the U.S. achieve energy independence, and that the pipeline would be far more efficient than oil transport by rail.

The pipeline was originally supposed to pass close to North Dakota's capital, populated mostly by residents of European descent, but that route did not pass muster in an environmental impact assessment. It was determined that wells that provided drinking water to the capital could be adversely affected. In turn, the route was shifted to pass through the ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, who hold the land to be sacred. They have been joined by environmental and social activists.

The construction of the Dakota Access pipeline has begun. The full pipeline should be operational within three months, the developer of the long-delayed project said Thursday, even as an American Indian tribe filed a legal challenge to block the work and protect its water supply. Workers had already drilled entry and exit holes for the crossing, and oil had been put in the pipeline leading up to the lake in anticipation of finishing the project. Work was stalled for months due to opposition by the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux, as well as a prolonged court battle between the developer and the Army Corps of Engineers that oversees the federal land where the last segment of the pipeline is now being laid. President Trump last month instructed the Corps to advance pipeline construction. The Cheyenne River Sioux on Thursday asked a federal judge to stop the Lake Oahe work while a lawsuit filed earlier by the two tribes against the pipeline proceeds. ETP, which maintains the pipeline is safe, didn't immediately respond in court to the filing. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg didn't immediately rule. The tribes' lawsuit filed last summer maintains that the pipeline project threatens their water and cultural sites. It's been on hold while the river crossing dispute has played out. The Cheyenne River Sioux on Thursday told Boasberg that it also wants to make a claim on freedom-of-religion grounds. Standing Rock Sioux attorney Jan Hasselman has said that tribe will also try to block the lake crossing in court, with likely arguments that further study is necessary to preserve tribal treaty rights and that it's part of the legal process for the company to obtain final permission to finish the pipeline. An assessment conducted last year determined the river crossing would not have a significant effect on the environment. However, the Army decided in December that further study was warranted to address tribal concerns. The Corps launched an environmental impact study on Jan. 18, but Trump signed an executive action six days later telling the Corps to allow the company to proceed with construction. Legal experts have disagreed on whether the Army can arbitrarily change its mind because of the change in White House administrations. Authorities are calling him a serial killer.

The arrests occurred on the road at the main entrance to Oceti Sakowin protest camp, which is situated at the edge of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation near Cannonball, North Dakota. Those arrested were willingly outside of the barrier put up by protesters to block police from going inside the dwelling area, according to officials. Police have yet to enter the inside of the camp where between 25 and 50 protesters remain, the governor said, who indicated that anyone voluntarily leaving overnight into Thursday would not face charges. Camp residents had been given until 2 p.m. local time Wednesday to evacuate the site.

Construction of this final phase has been the focus of a contentious legal battle and massive protests in recent months. While the Army Corps says this area is federally owned land, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe cites an 1851 treaty that it says designates the land for Native American tribes. The tribe, which claims its members were never meaningfully consulted before construction began, sued in July to block the four-state crude oil pipeline. That lawsuit is pending, and the Army Corps and the company behind the pipeline argued in court papers that they followed a standard review process. The protests have drawn thousands of Native Americans, environmental activists and their allies to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation. She also encouraged the Corps to share company documents containing risk analyses and spill models that had not been made available to the tribes during the initial environmental review. She is no longer in the position after the change in administrations. The move to deny the easement was hailed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and other pipeline opponents as a major victory. But on his second weekday in office, President Trump signed a memorandum aimed at advancing the Dakota Access Pipeline, as well as one directed at the Keystone XL Pipeline. Speer said the decision was made based on a sufficient amount of available information. The Army Corps on Feb. 8 granted an easement to the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline, allowing it to install the final segment of the pipeline. The court on Feb. 13 denied that motion seeking a temporary restraining order. The Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe also filed a separate motion seeking a preliminary injunction directing the Army Corps to withdraw the easement issued to the pipeline company.

The Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Sioux had asked U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington to direct the Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw permission for Texas-based developer Energy Transfer Partners to lay pipe under Lake Oahe in North Dakota. The tribes argued that construction under the lake violates their right to practice their religion, which relies on clean water, and they wanted the work suspended until the claim could be resolved. Dakota Access pipeline could be operating within weeks Native groups launch new legal fight against Dakota Access pipeline When they filed the lawsuit last summer, the tribes argued that the pipeline threatens Native American cultural sites and their water supply. Their religion argument was new, however, and disputed by both the Corps and the company. Boasberg in his ruling Tuesday said the tribes didn't raise the religion argument in a timely fashion. Boasberg said he is likely to allow the tribes to continue making the religion argument, though he doesn't think it's likely to succeed. The judge's decision came as Native Americans from across the country gathered in Washington to protest President Donald Trump's policies encouraging oil pipelines. They are planning four days of activities including lobbying lawmakers and culminating in a march on the White House. Tribal members and supporters plan to camp each day on the National Mall, with teepees, a ceremonial fire, cultural workshops and speakers. Keystone XL would be exempt from needing U.S. steel, reports say Keystone XL pipeline gets Trump's OK, but oilpatch needs to recommit In February, Boasberg declined the tribes' request to order an immediate halt to the pipeline construction, ruling that as long as oil wasn't flowing through the pipeline, there was no imminent harm to the tribes. Legal fight not done The court battle isn't over, as no final decision has been made on the merits of the tribes' overall claims. Both tribes also have asked Boasberg to overturn the federal permission for the Lake Oahe crossing and to bar the Corps from granting permission in the future. The judge won't rule until at least April. The pipeline saga has endured for months. Hundreds and sometimes thousands of pipeline opponents who sided with tribal opposition to the pipeline camped on federal land near the drill site for months, often clashing with police. There have been about 750 arrests in the region since August. Authorities last month closed the camp in advance of spring flooding season and set up roadblocks to prevent protesters from returning. Work under Lake Oahe had been held up in the courts until President Donald Trump last month instructed the Corps to advance construction. The Army is involved because its engineering branch manages the river and its system of hydroelectric dams, which is owned by the federal government. ETP began drilling under the lake Feb. 8. Company attorney William Scherman said in court documents that the pipeline could be moving oil as early as next week.

The parties are expected to meet Boasberg next Wednesday to discuss future steps. The Standing Rock Sioux are expected to argue that pipeline operations should be halted. The tribe had sued the Army Corps over its approval of the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, arguing the line could contaminate their water source, the Missouri River. It was unclear whether the judge would agree that the line should be shut. ETP was not immediately available for comment. In February, the Army Corps of Engineers granted the final easement needed to finish the controversial pipeline, which had been delayed for several months after protests led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and climate activists. The controversial pipeline needed a final permit to tunnel under Lake Oahe, a reservoir that is part of the Missouri River. Two previous arguments by the Standing Rock tribe - that the construction had threatened sacred sites, and that the presence of oil in the pipeline would damage sacred waters, had been rejected by the court. President Donald Trump issued an executive order days after being sworn in directing the Army Corps to smooth the path to finishing the line, prompting complaints by the tribe and environmental groups that it had not done an adequate environmental review.

Many activists traveled to Washington, D.C., from Standing Rock, where they had been camping out for months in opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline. Many are statutory and the legislation that created them cannot be swept aside by an executive order. Trump said that both pipeline projects would be subject to renegotiation. In an Oval Office signing before reporters, the president hinted at a possible new wrinkle. He said he would want any new projects to make use of American steel, though that requirement is not mentioned in his executive order. The orders will likely have an immediate impact in North Dakota, where the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners wants to complete the final 1,100-foot piece of the 1,172-mile pipeline route that runs under Lake Oahe. The pipeline would carry oil from the booming shale oil reserves in North Dakota to refineries and pipeline networks in Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other Native American groups have been protesting the project, which they say would imperil their water supplies and disturb sacred burial and archaeological sites. The Army Corp of Engineers called a halt to the project in December to consider alternative routes. The tribe is expected to return to court in a bid to block the project. The camp is in a flood plain, and heavy snow could pose dangers when it starts melting. TransCanada, the Calgary-based project owner, has said it would be interested in reviving the pipeline. Originally, TransCanada had planned to get about 65 percent of the steel pipe from U.S. manufacturers but other supplies from Canada. We build the pipelines, we want to build the pipe. President Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. During the daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer discussed the timeline for the Keystone XL pipeline project. (Reuters) As news of the move surfaced Tuesday morning, oil industry officials hailed it as overdue. Environmentalists, by contrast, vowed to continue to fight the two pipelines. Americans have tended to favor the Keystone XL project even as Obama rejected it. Earlier Post-ABC surveys found that Americans widely expected the project to create a significant amount of jobs, but that they were divided on whether it would pose a significant environmental risk.

An estimated 400 demonstrators, who refer to themselves as water protectors, were attempting to dismantle a nearly month-old roadblock that they say is preventing emergency services from quickly accessing the Oceti Sakowin (Seven Council Fires) protest camp and the Standing Rock community at large. Many were being treated for hypothermia. The Standing Rock Sioux maintain the land in question, recently acquired by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, is unceded Dakota territory as affirmed in the Ft. Laramie Treaty of 1851. During the late-October clash, military vehicles blocking the Backwater Bridge were set on fire and 147 people were arrested. But instead of removing the damaged vehicles, state officials left them where they were and, citing potential structural damage to the bridge as a result of the flames, closed the highway. In the meantime, water protectors claim that by keeping the highway closed the state is strangling the local economy and unnecessarily putting Native lives at risk. According to a press release issued yesterday by 350.org, a global environmental advocacy group currently working with Standing Rock: Despite the obvious public safety risk, and despite promises from Morton County that they would clear the road, law enforcement has insisted on keeping the vehicles on the bridge for weeks. This obstruction of Highway 1806 threatens the lives of the water protectors and residents of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, as emergency services have been needed but unable to reach camp quickly. The blockage also unjustly restricts the free movement of local residents and hurts the Tribe economically by cutting off travel to and from the Prairie Knights Casino. Images of the burned vehicles have fed negative, distorted, and sensationalist media portrayals of the encampment. He says that due to the police enforced roadblock, ambulances currently need an extra 30 minutes to get to and from the hospital. Goldtooth notes on social media early Monday that foreign media interest in Standing Rock was surpassing that of mainstream, domestic news agencies. This was just a fire hose.

White allies who showed up in solidarity are breathing a sigh of relief. For them, the day is won, the black snake is dead, and it's time to head home. But for the indigenous people they are leaving behind, the fight will rage on, harder than ever before. The Lakota Sioux people and their guests from around the globe built a veritable small city at Oceti Sakowin Camp in order to hold ground at Standing Rock, and now that the harsh North Dakota winter is settling in, they could be left with a bigger fight and fewer resources to fight it if the battle continues. At night, communal sleeping spaces are organized with burning wood stoves. People climb the hills above Highway 1806 to the north of Oceti Sakowin Camp to get a better view of the police presence beyond the blockades. The Army Corp of Engineers declined to grant Energy Transfer Partners, the corporation building the pipeline, the easement necessary to cross under Lake Oahe, and they called for environmental impact studies for alternative routes. But ETP doesn't intend to stop plowing through Sioux treaty lands, and Republicans are already bragging that once Donald Trump is in office, the pipeline will carry on as planned. This is big-government decision-making at its worst. I look forward to putting this anti-energy presidency behind us. The short-term victory against the pipeline effort was won by putting bodies on the line to occupy territory. The unintended consequence of celebration could be that those bodies become a scarce resource. When the North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple announced, falsely, that Standing Rock would be forced to evacuate, reinforcements still came. Now, many of the Lakota Sioux and the Standing Rock resistance allies believe that all of the fanfare around the declared victory will just be another attempted deterrent, but this time using the illusion of success to convince the Sioux that their job is done, and that they can head home. A blizzard battles Oceti Sakowin Camp the day after the victory announcement. It's an area of the North Dakota plains that the indigenous rarely settle due to harsh winters, and the camp is already struggling to winterize structures and keep the roads clear as the first blizzards set in.

The tribe will argue that the environmental impact statement process was wrongfully terminated. In November former President Obama ordered the Army to consider re-routing the pipeline to avoid being built within half a mile of an indigenous community. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, along with other campaigners and thousands of military veterans, engaged in peaceful marches to block the pipeline construction, even in freezing temperatures and snow blizzards.

There were almost 700 arrests. Tom Goldtooth, Native American environmental activist, told The Independent that the protests would now be repeated, as their plight had gained sympathy from around the world. The Army Corps had started a new study of the pipeline and its impact on 18 January, two days before Mr Obama left the White House, which would have taken up to two years to complete. Energy Transfer Partners responded that the review was politically motivated. Six days later, new President Trump signed an order, demanding the Corps review Mr Obama's study. In November 2015 Mr Obama had closed down that project, as it would pollute as many as 2,500 aquifers, according to activists. But Mr Trump has now reversed that decision.

The protesters won a reprieve in December, when the Army Corps of Engineers blocked the 1,172-mile pipeline's passage under the tribe's water source. The Corps of Engineers gave everyone until Wednesday afternoon to clear out. Yang, a Getty photographer, visited the Oceti Sakowin camp twice before, and found the solidarity among protesters overwhelming. There was orderliness. Everyone was getting fed. All resources were being distributed. People were unselfish. When the time came, most people left willingly, but on their terms. The fire was a final act of a defiance marking the end of the camp, but not the fight it represents. All rights reserved. Your California Privacy Rights.

One hundred sixty-seven people were injured and seven were taken to the hospital, according to Jade Begay, a spokeswoman for the Indigenous Environmental Network. The tribe fears that the pipeline, which is planned to cross under the river less than a mile from the Standing Rock Reservation, will threaten their water source and argue that construction has already disturbed sacred burial grounds. Pipeline construction is almost completed in North Dakota, but the company building it, Energy Transfer Partners, still lacks a final permit to drill under the river. On Tuesday, 15 November, the company went to court seeking to have a judge force the government to allow it to begin drilling immediately. The trucks have been in place for several weeks, and law enforcement has erected a barricade behind them, forcing all traffic to take an approximately 20-mile detour. Begay said that activists did light two bonfires to keep people warm and make soup and tea. Other fires were sparked by law enforcement weapons, she added. The activists successfully moved one of the trucks before law enforcement responded with tear gas, water cannons, and other weapons, Begay said.

In December, the US Army Corps of Engineers denied pipeline builder Energy Transfer Partners the necessary permission to build the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, and called for additional environmental review of pipeline routes. The decision arrived after months of protests and legal action led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which contended that the pipeline threatened a key water source. The tribe also argued that consultations around the pipeline, promised in treaties, were left out of the initial pipeline planning. The immediate path at forward for the pipeline is not clear. She believes a rapid reversal of this decision could raise legal questions. In 2015 the Obama administration rejected the Keystone XL pipeline, which was due to carry crude oil 1,179 miles from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska, after years of debate. The State Department denied the permit to builder TransCanada, saying the project did not benefit the national interests of the US in terms of jobs or contributions to the economy, and also presented an environmental threat. The administration's support of both projects cheered petroleum industry supporters. Environmental groups that fought both projects strongly condemned the executive orders Tuesday.

It was dark, and she was bundled up in a puffer jacket against the 20-degree temperature. She had volunteered, along with three others, to hold the ground in front of the span, which the protest army had cleared of police- and pipeline-company barricades earlier in the day. She fumbled to pick up a plastic shield, but the onslaught escalated. The explosion had ripped out the radius bone, muscle, nerves and arteries of her left arm, and her hand was hanging by a few threads of flesh. It was the police who were on guard. Wilansky was injured when she and a group of her fellow political extremists attacked the police who were guarding the bridge. They were also attempting to assemble some sort of explosive device, which is when Wilansky was hurt. This from the New York Times: Around the time of the explosion, Lieutenant Iverson said, officers fired sponge and beanbag rounds at three people who had shielded themselves behind a length of plywood near a burned vehicle on the bridge. The three were thought to be acting suspiciously and refused orders to emerge, he said. Officers saw someone roll metal cylinders to the protesters by the burned vehicle, Lieutenant Iverson said, and then heard an explosion. Afterward, he said, several protesters ran up, pulled a woman from under the vehicle and ran off. Three propane canisters were recovered from the vicinity of the explosion early Tuesday, he said. The larger point here is that the violence on the Backwater Bridge happened because the protesters provoked it. The protesters repeatedly attacked the pipeline workers and their equipment. When the police put up road blocks and check points to try and stop the violence, the protesters attacked the police. Had the protesters been peaceful, had they restrained themselves to lawful tactics, nobody (including Wilansky) would have been hurt.

The fact that company building Dakota Access Pipeline says THEY expect to complete it, doesn't mean it WILL be built. They HAVE to say this. Archambault also acknowledged the struggle of the young Native American activists who have spent months resisting the pipeline at grave risk to their health and safety. He continued: We thank the thousands of people who came to the camps to support us, and the tens of thousands who donated time, talent, and money to our efforts to stand against this pipeline in the name of protecting our water.

Now he was doing reconnaissance. The barricade was meant to stop the cops, or at least to slow them down. In late July, the Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners informed the Standing Rock Sioux that in five days its subsidiary would begin construction on a section of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) next to the reservation. Their encampments of teepees, tents, and RVs were mostly ignored by the media until private security guards set dogs on protesters and a few journalists were arrested, sparking a national conversation about tribal sovereignty, environmental racism, and police brutality. A leak or spill, activists believed, would poison the drinking water of as many as 10 million people, nearly all of them on Native American reservations. If the protesters were removed before then, Dakota Access would complete the 1,172-mile pipeline that would transport up to 570,000 barrels of crude a day.

Native unemployment levels are nearly double those of the overall population; their youth suicide rate is the highest in the nation. An early proposal to route the Dakota Access Pipeline through Bismarck, 45 miles north of the reservation, was rejected by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers because of concerns that it could harm the municipal water supply. In May 2015, the coastline near his reservation was ravaged by the rupture of an oil pipeline. Young protesters with red bandannas over their faces dragged tree trunks onto the highway and set them on fire. A heavyset teen stood before the flaming barricade, his back to the police. He paused and looked at his feet like he might cry. Someone else picked up the chant. The scene underscored the conflicts within the anti-pipeline movement. Some activists, led in part by a group of protesters who lived in a compound called Red Warrior Camp, were committed to stopping the pipeline through direct action. While many Standing Rock Sioux were out on the front lines, Archambault was also lobbying Washington in hopes of a legal victory. In early November, Red Warrior Camp was asked to leave Standing Rock for promoting tactics that the tribal leadership thought were too extreme. There were also tensions between white-led environmental groups like 350.org, which focuses on climate change, and Native activists, who believe the larger issue is one of tribal sovereignty and the unfinished struggle for Native American rights. I quit. Allard, a Sioux woman, was hosting a protest camp on her land; she was accompanied by her husband, Miles, who had called for nonviolence at the barricades a few days earlier. Construction resumed on the pipeline, whose North Dakota section was roughly 95 percent complete. Allard recalled the life of her great-great-grandmother, Nape Hote Win, who as a 9-year-old survived the 1863 Whitestone massacre, an attack by the U.S. Army 50 miles east of Standing Rock. She was held in a prisoner-of-war camp for seven years. That battle paved the way for the Standing Rock Sioux to be confined to their current reservation. In mid-November, the Army Corps of Engineers stepped in and said it would not allow completion of the pipeline until there had been further review of its environmental impact. Reaffirming that decision in early December, the Corps said it would consider alternate routes for the pipeline. I did nothing wrong. He had gone back to Montana, feeling bitter and defeated.

However, President Donald Trump on Tuesday signed an executive action to advance approval of both the Dakota Access Pipeline and the Keystone XL Pipeline, which had also been halted by the Obama administration.

At first, she remembered, the camp had anywhere from five to 30 people. Then, when Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the pipeline, put out notification that it was going to begin construction, the camp swelled to 200, then 700. It spilled over the river, into what was at first simply called the overflow camp. But as that camp grew, the campers began to feel it deserved its own name. Oceti Sakowin is the name for the Seven Council Fires, the political structure of what is known as the Great Sioux Nation. Faith Spotted Eagle is also part of the Seven Council Fires, from the Ihanktonwan or Yankton band. She too was there on what she remembered as a wintry, blowing day in April when the Sacred Stone camp first opened. An elder and grandmother, she had also been part of the successful fight against the Keystone XL Pipeline, and pointed out that the networks activated by that fight were coming together again in North Dakota. In 2013, she said, a dream of her grandmother sent her to look at the 1863 treaty between her people and the Pawnee. On the 150th anniversary of that treaty, Jan. 25, 2013, those nations, along with the Oglala and Ponca, signed the International Treaty to Protect the Sacred from Tar Sands Projects. Since that time, other nations have joined, and the treaty was renewed with prayers and a donation to the Sacred Stone camp. Standing Rock will do the same thing for the next one.

Mossett said. click to view this map on LittleSis There are petitions, Facebook pages for the Sacred Stone and Red Warrior camps, and a call for Barack Obama to visit the camp. The long-term strategy, she said, is similar to that of the Keystone XL project. They told us that about the Keystone XL and they are telling us that now about Dakota Access, that it is a done deal. If the permit is granted, she said, they will continue to hold the space, to risk arrest, to halt construction. The sentiments of Mossett and Spotted Eagle underscore what is perhaps most significant about the camps along the Cannonball River: What is happening here is something more than just a fight to stop a pipeline. In the speak-outs and prayer circles, speaker after speaker, from the Pacific Northwest and from the Amazon, from New York to Arizona recalled the historic violence committed against Native American people not far from where the camp stood. Many recalled the Battle of the Greasy Grass, what is taught to schoolchildren as the Battle of Little Bighorn, which LaDonna Allard wrote was the last time the Oceti Sakowin came together. But for her and others, the massacres at Wounded Knee and Whitestone were closer to mind. It was the anniversary of the Whitestone massacre, where 250 women and children were killed by the US military, when private security guards turned dogs on the protesters at Standing Rock. She was raised speaking Dakota, and counted herself lucky to have her language and the worldview that came with it. The grass-roots organizing that brought together the camp, she said, was helping the Standing Rock people and other tribal governments to look past the structures imposed on them by the process of colonization. In the camp, they experimented with bringing back the long-ago structure of the Oceti Sakowin. We are going to do this and make it happen. The lack of good cell phone service, Lay Ha noted, forces people to be more present. A nurse from the medic tent made rounds, making sure that people knew that at night, the Standing Rock ambulance parked on the grounds would leave but the medics would be on duty. At night, campfires burned and tepees glowed, lit from within, as the open mic for speak-outs gave way to singing and dancing. Bringing in porta potties. Waste disposal. The coming together of the nations was something Mossett wanted for as long as she could remember, and that more than anything helped her envision a victory, not just against the Dakota Access Pipeline, not just against the whole extractive industry but for something much bigger.

It's designed to transport half a million barrels of shale oil out of North Dakota each day, and the tribe fears that a leak could threaten tribal drinking water. Protesters have been camping on land now owned by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. But yesterday, Army Corps issued a deadline for protesters to move to a new site.

SIMON: I know you spent several days at the encampment earlier this week. XAYKAOTHAO: First, the place is called Oceti Sakowin Camp. It's more than an hour south of Bismarck. And this place - it's almost mystical. When you drive into it, volunteers say welcome home. And there are hundreds of signs and messages, flags representing tribes or independent groups. There's even a school for children, a mental health building, a medic tent. At night, people gather at what is called a sacred fire. They talk stories. They sing. People go to sleep to the sound of drums, and they wake up to the sound of prayers. And one morning, I heard cow bells ringing and volunteers shouting, wake up, water protectors. SIMON: Protesters have been camped out there for several months. XAYKAOTHAO: Well, that's a complicated question to answer. Late Friday, we saw a letter circulating on social media from a district manager with the Corps to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe chairman. NPR verified that letter to be authentic. And basically, it gave the chairman until Dec. 5 to call supporters and tribes to leave federal land for safety reasons. Now, the letter did state that the protesters could relocate to a free-speech area on the south side of the river. But also, it's an area where if people are going to stay through the bitter cold North Dakota winters, it would be easier access for emergency vehicles. One thing, though, I should say, Scott, is that the timing of the closure of the camp on Dec. 5 coincides with a planned visit by some 2,100 veterans. So people are obviously making the connection that the closure is connected to the arrival of the veterans. XAYKAOTHAO: Well, Standing Rock Sioux tribe Chairman Dave Archambault said in a statement that he's disappointed. He says, we have suffered much, but we still have hope that the president will act on his commitment to close the chapter of broken promises to our people and especially our children. Now, you can imagine that the mood in the camp is, you know, dark. I mean, people are trying to figure out what is going to happen next. And the number of protesters out there is estimated to be between five to 10,000 strong this holiday weekend. SIMON: Doualy Xaykaothao of Minnesota Public Radio, thanks so much for being with us.

Many activists traveled to Washington, D.C., from Standing Rock, where they had been camping out for months in opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline. Many are statutory and the legislation that created them cannot be swept aside by an executive order. Trump said that both pipeline projects would be subject to renegotiation. In an Oval Office signing before reporters, the president hinted at a possible new wrinkle. He said he would want any new projects to make use of American steel, though that requirement is not mentioned in his executive order. The orders will likely have an immediate impact in North Dakota, where the pipeline company Energy Transfer Partners wants to complete the final 1,100-foot piece of the 1,172-mile pipeline route that runs under Lake Oahe. The pipeline would carry oil from the booming shale oil reserves in North Dakota to refineries and pipeline networks in Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other Native American groups have been protesting the project, which they say would imperil their water supplies and disturb sacred burial and archaeological sites. The Army Corp of Engineers called a halt to the project in December to consider alternative routes. The tribe is expected to return to court in a bid to block the project. The camp is in a flood plain, and heavy snow could pose dangers when it starts melting. TransCanada, the Calgary-based project owner, has said it would be interested in reviving the pipeline. Originally, TransCanada had planned to get about 65 percent of the steel pipe from U.S. manufacturers but other supplies from Canada. We build the pipelines, we want to build the pipe. President Trump signed executive orders Tuesday to revive the controversial Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. During the daily briefing, White House press secretary Sean Spicer discussed the timeline for the Keystone XL pipeline project. (Reuters) As news of the move surfaced Tuesday morning, oil industry officials hailed it as overdue. Environmentalists, by contrast, vowed to continue to fight the two pipelines. Americans have tended to favor the Keystone XL project even as Obama rejected it. Earlier Post-ABC surveys found that Americans widely expected the project to create a significant amount of jobs, but that they were divided on whether it would pose a significant environmental risk.

Kaufman Chris D'Angelo, HuffPost US In April 2016, just five months after President Barack Obamarejected the proposal to build the Keystone XL pipeline, the existing Keystone pipeline leaked 17,000 gallons of oil onto private land in southeastern South Dakota. For Art Tanderup, a Nebraska farmer who spent the last five years crusading to keep TransCanada from building the conduit over his modest 160 acres, the spill confirmed his worst fears. He was even more distraught when President Donald Trump reversed course and announced he would approve Keystone XL pipeline days after taking office in January. Keystone XL was the subject of seven-year fight between environmentalists and the Obama administration before Trump reversed course. Trump vowed to jumpstart the United States economy by promoting fossil fuels, slashing environmental regulations and making it easier for drilling and pipeline projects to begin. He signed an executive action in January making Keystone XL and the Dakota Access pipeline top priorities. The State Department approved Keystone XL in March, the same month the Army approved completion of Dakota Access without an environmental study. The farm has been in Helen Tanderup's family for more than 100 years. Construction on the Dakota Access pipeline finished a month later. In August, the Nebraska Public Service Commission began contentious hearings to assess whether Keystone XL would benefit the state. The regulators are scheduled to vote Monday on whether to approve the pipeline, but are barred under state law from considering the South Dakota spill in their decision. The proposed 1,179-mile pipeline would, as the name implies, extend a shortcut for Canadian tar sands pumped through the existing Keystone Pipeline to refineries in Texas. It would carry 830,000 barrels of oil per day, producing emissions equivalent to putting 5.6 million new cars on the road, according to estimates from the environmental nonprofit Friends of the Earth. The proposed route through Nebraska traverses the Sandhills, a region of ancient prairies and sand dunes. It would also cut through the Ogallala, the largest aquifer in North America, at times going underwater. The rock formation, spongey with gravel, silt, sand, and clay, formed 10 million years ago and replenishes very slowly from surface rivers and streams. The water level is particularly close to the surface in Nebraska, making it especially vulnerable in a spill. While the company estimated Keystone XL would have 11 spills of 50 barrels or more over a 50-year period, Stansbury pegged the figure at 91. He also estimated there would be approximately two major spills per year, some potentially releasing as much as 180,000 barrels. The highly pollutive oil would then go to refineries in Texas. During the trial over the past year, TransCanada failed to defend their two main arguments for how Keystone XL would benefit Nebraska, he said. TransCanada pitched the pipeline as a steady stream of tax revenue, but limited its forecasts to 15 years. By the 16th year, the tax gains for the state would drop off to zero. Because the company planned to operate the pipeline for 50 years, that means the conduit would be a drain on state resources for 35 years. The company also failed to justify the proposed route for the pipeline, Domina said. The firm insisted it could not alter the route through Nebraska due to legal restrictions in South Dakota, where the Keystone pipeline is located. But during cross examination, a company engineer admitted TransCanada based that argument on a narrow work permit technicality. TransCanada did not return emails requesting comment Friday. For Allison Reville, a political activist and member of the Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate Sioux Tribe, the incident this week is exactly what she and other pipeline opponents have been warning about and knew would happen. While the cleanup effort will be important, Renville said she hopes the incident will discourage officials from approving Keystone XL and serve as a wake-up call for the residents of red South Dakota, in particular the farming community. she said.

This pipeline never should have been routed near these sacred lands in the first place, and it absolutely never should have received permits without a thorough and meaningful discussion of the risks and benefits to affected Indian Tribes. The Corps further stated that it plans to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement for alternative routes. These actions trigger a new round of public involvement processes to permit the final piece of the pipeline as required by the National Environmental Policy Act. The decision is major victory for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and all who stood in solidarity over the last few months. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, represented by Earthjustice, brought a lawsuit against the Corps for its approvals for the pipeline in July of this year. The lawsuit claimed that the Corps violated multiple environmental and historic preservation statutes, focusing on the decision to reroute the pipeline from Bismarck, North Dakota to the doorstep of the Standing Rock reservation without an adequate environmental analysis and consultation. At various times, pipeline construction has been subject to court injunctions due to the litigation. The Corps granted permits for the pipeline in July 2016 under a highly streamlined approval process known as Nationwide Permitting. The process circumvents any kind of close environmental review and public process. It was this easement that the government confirmed would not be granted. We thank the tribal youth who initiated this movement. We thank the millions of people around the globe who expressed support for our cause. We thank the thousands of people who came to the camps to support us, and the tens of thousands who donated time, talent, and money to our efforts to stand against this pipeline in the name of protecting our water. We especially thank all of the other tribal nations and jurisdictions who stood in solidarity with us, and we stand ready to stand with you if and when your people are in need. This pipeline never should have been routed near these sacred lands in the first place, and it absolutely never should have received permits without a thorough and meaningful discussion of the risks and benefits to affected Indian Tribes.

Yurts, a round tent popular in the cold tundra of East Asia, have started appearing. Portable toilets are being swapped out for heated, composting commodes. Ice cleats, which strap onto boots to give stability on ice, are now in demand. Taylor Orpin, 23, quit her job to move to the camp last month. She spends her days collating donated coats by size and gender in a tent near the camp's main fire circle. Thousands of people, led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, are protesting the pipeline, which would carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico. The route is adjacent to the Standing Rock reservation, and the tribe and climate activists say the line risks contamination of the tribe's water source and its construction has damaged, and would further damage, sacred sites. While clothing, food and money have been pouring in from all over the world, the camp's website requests more donations of wood, blankets, winter sleeping bags and propane to help weather the winter. A division of labor keeps many active, with campers volunteering in the four kitchens, shoveling snow, building tents and doing myriad other tasks. The multitudes at the camp defy the predictions of state and local officials, many of whom said out-of-state protesters would flee south like migrating birds. Children can be seen sliding playfully down nearby hills while senior citizens gossip over fire pits. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple issued an evacuation order for the camp earlier this week, citing the weather. That followed the Army Corps' earlier decree to vacate the camp, which is on federal land, by Monday. The state is not going to enforce that order, and voluntary compliance doesn't look likely. DONATIONS AND SKILLS It's not clear how much money has been raised to build and sustain the camp since it was founded last spring, but estimates stand in the millions of dollars. The Obama Administration has twice delayed approval for ETP to tunnel the pipeline under the Missouri River. This one-mile stretch is the last unfinished spot on the line in North Dakota. The Three Affiliated Tribes of the MHA Nation, another large American Indian tribe in North Dakota, earlier this fall funded portable toilets, food and garbage removal. Even though they have earned billions from the extraction of oil and gas from their lands, the MHA have supported the Standing Rock protest. U.S. postal locations in nearby Bismarck and Fort Yates have been engulfed with donated packages. A UPS spokesman said the number well exceeds what is usual for the area. Beyond donations, Hollywood actors like Shailene Woodley and Susan Sarandon have visited North Dakota, though they are not currently at the camp. Some campers bring technical skills. Joshua Tree, 42, has helped install solar panels and wind turbines to power a white, dome-like structure that dwarfs everything else here. The dome, which organizers say can hold 380 people, is where most meetings and press events are held. As the group tries to ward off the cold, challenges loom. One family had to be hospitalized on Thursday due to carbon monoxide poisoning after attempting to heat a tent using propane without proper ventilation. That feeds concern from law enforcement that protesters don't respect the weather. Signs posted around the camp note there are 18 different communal sleeping areas that are warmer than personal tents."}, {"URL": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/cheats/2016/11/11/obama-administration-to-green-light-dakota-access-pipeline.html?via=desktop&source=copyurl", "Timestamp": "20180918231516", "Sentences": "Follow JOIN Log In Benefits Overview Exclusive Content My Account Your Turn Log Out Cheat Sheet Politics Entertainment World News Half Full Arts and Culture U.S. News Tech Hunt for the Cure Science Scouted Travel STANDING ROCK 2 years ago Obama to Green-Light Dakota Access Pipeline The Obama administration is set to approve the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) project to begin as early as the beginning of next week, sources told Politico.

The 1,172-mile pipeline from Energy Transfer Partners hopes to reshape the landscape of U.S. crude oil supply by transporting crude from the oil-rich Bakken Formation in North Dakota through the Midwest. But tribal leaders argue that the pipeline, which would carry 470,000 barrels of oil a day, threatens the Standing Rock Sioux tribe's environmental well-being and would destroy sacred tribal sites.

Hilton and many other veterans who traveled to North Dakota in December are on standby, preparing for the call to return to protest. While building a shelter at a Standing Rock camp in December, Hilton explained the water crisis that he experienced was part of his motivation to travel the 1,200 miles to stand with others who feared for their water supply. Energy Transfer Partners has been waiting to complete the final piece of the 1,172-mile, multibillion-dollar pipeline, which, if complete, would route approximately 450,000 barrels of crude oil each day through North Dakota to pipeline networks in Illinois.

On her ten-day tour last month, Tauli-Corpuz visited tribes all over the country, from Albuquerque to Bismarck to Boulder. She also discussed the Dakota Access pipeline with North Dakota Senator John Hoeven and Major General Donald Jackson, Jr., the United States Army Corps of Engineers Deputy Commanding General for Civil and Emergency Operations. In January, the US Army Corps officially announced their intention to conduct a lengthy environmental inspection before issuing a permit for construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. Just days after President Trump's memoranda were issued, the Corps reversed that decision and on Feb. 7 issued permission to begin drilling. But it stops short of requiring the government to act on those suggestions, and tribal leaders and activists say their preferences have long gone ignored. He added that the report was spot on. In discussions with US officials, Tauli-Corpuz suggested strengthening the requirements for agencies to communicate with native tribes on decisions, and Anderson believes such a statutory fix is necessary. Previous UN rapporteurs have made similar recommendations to better acknowledge tribal rights, particularly pertaining to consultation.

WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Tuesday he hopes to decide by about March 7 on a request by Native American tribes for the Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw an easement on religious grounds for the final link of the Dakota Access Pipeline. At a hearing Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. Court in Washington, D.C., said he hoped to provide a written ruling by that time on the injunction requested by the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes regarding the final section of the line to go under a lake in North Dakota. The tribes, who have rights to water access in the area, say that the oil pipeline would spiritually degrade river and lake water and harm religious practices even if it does not spill. Their legal options to stop the pipeline are dwindling. Earlier this month, Boasberg denied a request by the tribes for a temporary restraining order to halt construction of the project. Boasberg on Tuesday questioned how the water could be harmed since the pipeline is being built under the Lake Oahe and oil would not likely touch the water in the event of a spill. Nicole Ducheneaux, a lawyer for the tribes, said at the hearing that the pipeline would spiritually degrade the water on the Missouri River because of its presence and that would prevent tribes from carrying out ceremonies because other nearby water sources had been contaminated from decades of mining.

Get Ground Game in your inbox: Daily updates and analysis on national politics from James Pindell. It was not immediately clear whether the incoming administration would support the decision. President-elect Donald Trump has said he supports finishing the project. Trump owns stock in the company building the pipeline but has said his support has nothing to do with his investment. What started as a small but fierce protest in a remote spot along the Missouri River months ago has evolved into an epic standoff involving hundreds of tribes, various celebrities, and activists. About 250 military veterans joined the protest Sunday. Environmental groups that protested alongside the tribes also rejoiced at the decision. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and its allies in the environmental and activist movements had said they were doing just that: using Lake Oahe in North Dakota as a place to take a stand by setting up camps and obstructing roads to block the Dakota Access Pipeline and its owner, Energy Transfer Partners. The pipeline, if completed, would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal in Illinois. At 30 inches in diameter, it could transport an estimated 470,000 barrels of oil per day. Army officials said the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an environmental-impact statement with full public input and analysis, a process likely to take many months. Energy Transfer Partners had said it was unwilling to reroute the project. The federal government had ordered people to leave the main encampment, which is on Army Corps of Engineers land, by Monday. But demonstrators said they were prepared to stay, and authorities said they would not forcibly remove them. About 250 members of the group Veterans Stand for Standing Rock gathered earlier Sunday about a mile from the Oceti Sakowin, or Seven Council Fires, camp. Art Grayson, 29, of Cambridge, Mass., a Navy veteran and Harvard graduate student, told the Associated Press that he came to the camp as part of the veterans group because he thought the demonstrators could use his help. Grayson said he flew to the state, then met with other veterans and rode the final leg of the trip from Bismarck in a pickup truck. Jo-Ellen Darcy said she based her decision on a need to explore alternate routes for the Dakota Access Pipeline crossing. Her office had announced on November 14, 2016 that it was delaying the decision on the easement to allow for discussions with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation lies 0.5 miles south of the proposed crossing. Tribal officials have expressed repeated concerns over the risk that a pipeline rupture or spill could pose to its water supply and treaty rights. Darcy said that the consideration of alternative routes would be best accomplished through an Environmental Impact Statement with full public input and analysis. The Dakota Access Pipeline is an approximately 1,172 mile pipeline that would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Pakota, Illinois. The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter and is projected to transport approximately 470,000 barrels of oil per day, with a capacity as high as 570,000 barrels. Real journalism.

SUBSCRIBE A pipeline leak has spilled tens of thousands of gallons of crude oil into a North Dakota creek roughly two and a half hours from Cannon Ball, where protesters are camped out in opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline. Members of the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes, as well as environmentalists from around the country, have fought the pipeline project on the grounds that it crosses beneath a lake that provides drinking water to native Americans. They say the route beneath Lake Oahe puts the water source in jeopardy and would destroy sacred land. North Dakota officials estimate more than 176,000 gallons of crude oil leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline into the Ash Coulee Creek. State environmental scientist Bill Suess says a landowner discovered the spill on Dec. 5 near the city of Belfield, which is roughly 150 miles from the epicenter of the Dakota Access pipeline protest camps. The leak was contained within hours of the its discovery, Wendy Owen, a spokeswoman for Casper, Wyoming-based True Cos., which operates the Belle Fourche pipeline, told CNBC. It's not yet clear why electronic monitoring equipment didn't detect the leak, Owen told the Asssociated Press. Owen said the pipeline was shut down immediately after the leak was discovered. United States Assistant Secretary of the Army Jo-Ellen Darcy said the best path forward was to explore alternative routes for the pipeline, something Energy Transfer Partners says it will not do. Energy Transfer Partners says the Dakota Access pipeline would include safeguards such as leak detection equipment and that workers monitoring the pipeline remotely in Texas could close valves within three minutes if a breach is detected. Republican President-elect Donald Trump has voiced support for the Dakota Access Pipeline. About 5,000 people are still occupying land near the planned construction site. Owen said the pipeline was built in the 1980s and is used to gather oil from nearby oil wells to a collection point. Suess said the spill migrated almost 6 miles from the spill site along Ash Coulee Creek, and it fouled an unknown amount of private and U.S. Forest Service land along the waterway. The creek feeds into the Little Missouri River, but Seuss said it appears no oil got that far and that no drinking water sources were threatened. The creek was free-flowing when the spill occurred but has since frozen over. Related: Dakota Pipeline Was Denied After Engineers Gave Approval About 60 workers were on site Monday, and crews have been averaging about 100 yards daily in their cleanup efforts, he said. Some of the oil remains trapped beneath the frozen creek. Suess says about 37,000 gallons of oil have been recovered. The 32,000-gallon spill temporarily shut down water supplies in the downstream community of Glendive, Montana, after oil was detected in the city's water treatment system. True Cos. operates at least three pipeline companies with a combined 1,648 miles of line in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming, according to information the companies submitted to federal regulators. Since 2006, the companies have reported 36 spills totaling 320,000 gallons of petroleum products, most of which was never recovered. Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Photo courtesy United Tribes News Less than three weeks later, the youth were back in D.C., and Woodley, Riley Keough, Susan Sarandon joined a huge rally at a federal courthouse, where the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe requested a preliminary injunction against the Army Corps in hopes of stopping the pipeline. A ruling is expected by Friday. Even though the tribe only named the Army Corps as the defendant in the lawsuit, the Obama administration has taken notice. A hearing on Tuesday regarding an emergency request for a temporary restraining order drew an appearance from Solicitor Hillary Tompkins of the Interior Department, which is otherwise not involved in the dispute. When administration officials attend hearings in other cases, they typically take places in a reserved row of seats behind the table where attorneys from the Department of Justice are seated. It's typically seen as a show of support for the federal government. But Tompkins and her colleagues instead took seats behind the table where the attorney representing the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe was seated. The courtroom was nearly full, though, and the row of seats behind the DOJ table was taken up by the large Dakota Access team so Tompkins most likely found the most convenient place to watch the proceeding. Appeals are expected no matter how Judge James E. Boasberg rules on the injunction. But even though the matter is under litigation, the Obama administration plays a major role in determining whether the Dakota Access Pipeline goes forward -- the Army Corps has yet to issue a key easement for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River.

The route has the necessary permits in Montana and South Dakota, where activists are preparing to oppose the pipeline if construction goes ahead. The comments fly against much of the Republican support for the project, which has long touted job creation, energy independence and local tax revenue as a justification. The pipeline would carry a daily load of 830,000 barrels of crude oil from Alberta in Canada, along a 1,204-mile route to Steele City, Nebraska, where it will meet the existing Keystone pipeline and transport crude tar sands oil, which is dirtier and more energy-intensive to extract than other oil, down to refineries on the Gulf coast. It is likely that a significant amount of the refined product is destined for export, and the state department estimates that while the project will result in tens of thousands of temporary jobs, just 50 permanent positions will remain after construction. TransCanada says the pipeline will bring jobs, and that the route is safe and will be protected by state-of-the-art leak detection technology. TransCanada insists it has consulted all parties along the route, including Native American tribal leaders. The Obama administration blocked the project in 2015, after the state department found the construction would undermine US leadership in the fight against global warming. In Montana and South Dakota, advocates estimate that dozens of landowners were essentially forced to sign easements with TransCanada under the threat of eminent domain, the right by which private land is seized for public use. Art Tanderup, a Nebraska corn farmer and one of the remaining 90 landowners in the state yet to have signed an easement with TransCanada, said he and his wife planned to lay down their bodies to prevent the company from digging up their land. The Nebraska public service commission, which is administered by five elected commissioners, will hold public hearings over a week in early August, with a decision on the route proposal expected later in the year. A set of meeting minutes seen by the Guardian in the city of Baker, Montana, show that TransCanada representatives told local officials in February that they could commence construction of pipeline pumping stations in 2018, with a view to building the pipeline itself between 2019 and 2020.

Story Continued Below Keystone XL, which was rejected by former President Barack Obama in 2015, has been at the center of one of the largest opposition campaigns in the history of the environmental movement, with activists conducting a years-long effort to kill the project. During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly promised to approve Keystone XL, which would carry Canadian oil sands crude from Alberta to Texas, and he said he wants the U.S. government to get 25 percent of the pipeline's profits. Another of the executive actions signed on Tuesday was aimed at identifying high priority infrastructure projects and speeding the required environmental reviews that Trump blamed for slowing construction of important infrastructure projects. We can't be in an environmental process for 15 years if a bridge is going to be falling down or if a highway is crumbling. That's what it has to do with. Building the Keystone XL pipeline would also be a boon for Trump's friend and early energy adviser Harold Hamm, the founder and CEO of Continental Resources, the oil company that is the biggest oil producer in North Dakota's Bakken field. The pipeline would help transport oil from those wells, which have relied in the past on trains to get the crude to customers. It was not immediately clear if Trump was altering the 2004 George W. Bush administration order that requires a broad inter-agency review of cross-border pipeline projects led by the State Department, but simplifying that process move that would make it easier to approve Keystone. While Trump has long been expected to take steps to approve Keystone, two people familiar with the issue said Trump administration officials have had little communication with the State Department in the runup to the executive actions. One of those people said State did not sign off on the executive actions. Mulvaney defends nanny tax lapse, tangles with Democrats on budget By BEN WEYL and BRENT GRIFFITHS Building Keystone XL faces a number of obstacles. The pipeline is still awaiting approval from Nebraska state regulators for its proposed route, and many landowners in the state are opposed to the project. The planned 1,100-mile Dakota Access pipeline, which would run from North Dakota to Illinois, has also become a focal point of progressive opposition to fossil fuel projects. Native American tribes joined with activists in protests that have occasionally turned violent and caught national attention over the last few months. The Standing Rock Sioux, which has been at the center of the protests because of the threat the tribe says the pipeline poses to its water supply, said Trump's order violates previous agreements they had struck with the federal government. Any move to approve the pipelines will face legal challenges from environmental groups, and Democrats and activists immediately bashed Trump over the pending actions. Jamie Henn, co-founder of the environmental group 350.org, promised that greens will fight Trump. A Trump spokeswoman told reporters last year that he sold his stake in the company. Earlier Tuesday at a meeting with auto industry executives, Trump criticized the sometimes lengthy process required to secure environmental permits required to build infrastructure projects.

Nov. 23, 2016 President-elect Donald J. Trump, however, has taken a different view of the project and said as recently as last week that he supported finishing the 1,170-mile pipeline, which crosses four states and is almost complete. Mr. Trump owns stock in the company building the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, but he has said that his support has nothing to do with his investment. There was no immediate response from Energy Transfer Partners, but its chief executive, Kelcy Warren, has said that the company was unwilling to reroute the pipeline, which is intended to transport as much as 550,000 barrels of oil a day from the oil fields of western North Dakota to a terminal in Illinois.

Since August when the protests against the construction of the oil pipeline reached historic proportions and made major headlines, some Native-American water protectors and allies have been seriously injured by the indiscriminate use of life-threatening crowd-control weapons by law enforcement. People across the globe witnessed much of this abuse through live video feeds shared through social media and footage taken by independent indigenous drone journalists. Sadly, these reports were confirmed and further substantiated during a U.N. hearing earlier this week co-facilitated by the International Indian Treaty Council and the ACLU. Several water protectors gave testimonials about being shot with rubber bullets at point blank range, hosed with water cannons in freezing temperatures, beaten by officers, and incapacitated by concussion grenades. Witnesses described the war-like weapons being deployed indiscriminately, against medics, reporters, elders, pregnant woman, and legal observers. Protesters who were arrested testified about abuse and ill-treatment in detention, including being held in dog kennels. The testimonies were heartbreaking and disturbing. There has been little, if any, leadership from local authorities to curtail the well-documented abuses. There has been a resounding lack of accountability for law enforcement agents and commanders. Some were hit with outlandish felony charges and high bail bonds. More than likely, if state leaders do not require a significant change in policing tactics, law enforcement will only continue its violent and unconstitutional responses to largely peaceful protesters. This must be investigated, and the people responsible for releasing dogs on protestors should be held accountable. Recently, the Standing Rock Tribal Council called for the evacuation of the camps behind the Dakota Access Pipeline protests within 30 days, which means by February 19. However, the question remains whether law enforcement will use force to clear the camps and, whether on accident or with intent, injure or kill someone who refuses to leave in an act of civil disobedience. But where local law enforcement quickly resorts to the massive use of less-lethal weapons, it is the responsibility of the state and federal governments to step in. The state and federal governments must rein in the county sheriff and private security contractors, and they must immediately end any unlawful surveillance practices against individuals and groups expressing their right to free speech and peaceful assembly. Until then, the ACLU will continue to monitor the situation through legal observers and will consider taking legal action including supporting the Water Protectors Legal Collaborative. We have also released an action requesting the public to call North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum and urge him to do everything in his power to prevent police violence against Standing Rock water protectors. Using crowd control weapons will only exacerbate the injuries and trauma that has plagued Native American communities and water protectors since the pipeline protest intensified this past August. That carnage is occurring right now at the hands of law enforcement in Standing Rock. If Trump truly intends to end unnecessary violence, he must listen to the voices of Native American water protectors and those who are supporting them at Standing Rock, and he must vow to protect their right to water, sacred sites, and their future development as sovereign nations. Human decency requires it. The executive order makes no reference to the Dakota Access Pipeline, the 1,100-mile pipeline being constructed to carry nearly 500 million gallons of fracked crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois each day. Yet expediting the construction of DAPL is the obvious goal of the executive order. The Obama administration recognized that the pipeline has the capacity to cause catastrophic misery and loss if it ruptures. The Obama administration also confirmed that under federal law DAPL cannot be approved until proper consultation with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is completed. Moreover, under international legal principles, our government should seek the informed consent of indigenous people prior to undertaking a project on federal land that threatens their health and welfare. Yet Trump seems determined to rush the approval process. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe strenuously argues that construction of the pipeline would violate its rights under federal treaties and statutes. Those are issues that may ultimately need to be litigated. At this point, however, Trump apparently agrees that the law requires the Army Corps to complete the environmental impact assessment and determine the threat to the environment before going ahead with the pipeline. The Trump administration should therefore allow the Army Corps to take the time it needs to conduct a careful and proper assessment of environmental impact, both to the general public and to the tribe.

About 250 veterans gathered about a mile from the main camp for a meeting with organizer Wes Clark Jr., the son of former Democratic presidential candidate Gen. Wesley Clark. The group had said about 2,000 veterans were coming, but it wasn't clear how many actually arrived.

In a piece early this month, Nives Dolsak and Aseem Prakash explained the DAPL controversy: DAPL is designed to carry 570,000 barrels of Bakken crude oil per day from the Dakotas to Illinois. To make this journey, DAPL needs to cross the Missouri River. Initially, this crossing was supposed to take place just north of Bismarck, the capital of North Dakota. But engineers flagged the possibility of drinking water contamination if the pipeline were to leak. DAPL was therefore rerouted north of the Standing Rock reservation instead. The message is clear: While the risk of water contamination is not acceptable for Bismarckians, it is OK for the Sioux Indians. The pipeline is nearly complete and Kelcy Warren, the CEO of Energy Transfer Partners, which is building DAPL, has said that a reroute will not be considered. Last Monday, the Army Corps of Engineers issued a call for more dialogue with the Standing Rock tribe as it considers whether to grant an easement for the next stage of the pipeline.

Leave a respectful comment. Email Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Pinterest Tumblr Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Keystone XL survived politics, but economics could kill it Nation Aug 3, 2017 11:53 AM EDT LINCOLN, Neb. Low oil prices and the high cost of extracting Canadian crude from oil sands are casting new doubts on Keystone XL as executives with the Canadian company that wants to build it face the final regulatory hurdle next week in Nebraska. The pipeline proposed in 2008 has faced dozens of state and federal delays, many of them prompted by environmental groups who ultimately persuaded President Barack Obama to deny federal approval in November 2015. The company has invited customers to bid for long-term contracts to ship oil on the pipeline. The bidding will run through September. An energy expert said the project has been delayed so long it may no longer make economic sense. The 1,179-mile pipeline would transport oil from tar sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, across Montana and South Dakota to Nebraska, where it would connect with existing pipelines that feed Texas Gulf Coast refineries. South Dakota and Montana regulators have approved the project, although there are legal challenges pending in both states. Only Nebraska has yet to give regulatory approval. The rest of the route for the oil to the Gulf would travel an existing pipeline in the network. Mason said the biggest economic problem is that synthetic crude from the Canadian deposits is considered a lower-value product because it tends to be heavier, and thus more expensive to refine into gasoline and jet fuel. The elected commission is comprised of four Republicans and one Democrat. Nebraska law enforcement authorities already have had discussions with their counterparts in North Dakota about how that state handled widespread protests during construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline near the Standing Rock Indiana Reservation, said Cody Thomas, a Nebraska State Patrol spokesman. Protesters led by Native American tribes and environmental groups flocked to North Dakota last summer to rally against the Dakota Access Pipeline, and some camped out in bitter cold through early this year, prompting the state to send a large law enforcement contingent that sometimes skirmished with protesters. The pipeline was ultimately completed but legal challenges remain. To highlight his opposition, Carlson is installing solar panels on his land directly in the path of the proposed pipeline. If the Nebraska commission approves the route, TransCanada can initiate legal proceedings under eminent domain to gain access to the land of holdout property owners. TransCanada has secured agreement with roughly 90 percent of Nebraska landowners along the route. The company said that if it decides to go ahead with the project, it would need six to nine months to start doing some of the staging of the construction crews followed by two years of construction.

Part of the great Dakota Access pipeline system, the Bayou Bridge pipeline is a crude oil pipeline intended to span 162.5 miles across the state, running from Lake Charles to St. James. The pipeline will bring oil refineries in the state closer to neighboring Texas, which serves as a regional energy hub. Approximately 280,000 barrels of crude oil would purportedly pass daily through the pipeline, coming into contact with hundreds of wetlands and waterways. That includes close proximity to drinking water for upwards of 300,000 people. The pipeline would cut through the Atchafalaya Basin, the largest U.S. river swamp.

The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes had argued that information about spill risks could potentially strengthen their case for more environmental review of the project. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg rejected that argument, saying that shielding the information from public view would prevent vandalism of the pipeline. Other information, however, will be available to the public, such as how Energy Transfer Partners plans to handle potential spills. Last year, protest camps near the Standing Rock Sioux reservation brought tens of thousands of protesters, including military veterans and activists from other countries. At times, the protests turned violent, with police using non-lethal bullets, dogs, teargas, and water cannons against protesters. As of February, there had been 750 arrests of anti-pipeline protesters, according to the Associated Press. The Obama administration had temporarily halted construction of the pipeline in December, ordering the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct a more thorough environmental study of the risks associated with the pipeline. Any spill, the tribe argued, could threaten their access to clean water. The Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes are still currently engaged in litigation against the pipeline, arguing that the Army Corps failed to conduct a thorough enough environmental study of the pipeline. They also argue that the government failed to take tribal concerns into account when approving the pipeline. When pipeline operators, for instance, violate laws like the Clean Water Act by spilling pollutants into waterways, the EPA is normally the agency that imposes fines on those operators. Last week, for instance, the EPA and the Department of Justice issued a fine against a pipeline operator in Ohio that violated the Clean Water Act by discharging approximately 1,950 barrels of gasoline from a pipeline into nearby waterways. Comments A note of caution regarding our comment sections: For months a stream of media reports have warned of coordinated propaganda efforts targeting political websites based in the U.S., particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election. We too were alarmed at the patterns we were, and still are, seeing. It is clear that the provocateurs are far more savvy, disciplined, and purposeful than anything we have ever experienced before. It is also clear that we still have elements of the same activity in our article discussion forums at this time. We have hosted and encouraged reader expression since the turn of the century. The comments of our readers are the most vibrant, best-used interactive feature at Reader Supported News. Accordingly, we are strongly resistant to interrupting those services.

Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the UN special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, said construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) over sacred tribal sites and through Lake Oahe, the Standing Rock Sioux's water source, was conducted with a lack of respect to the tribe's land rights. She said she is also concerned about how protests of the pipeline were met with aggressive police force. She was invited to the US by Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault, AP reported. She said she will eventually recommend a full study of the DAPL's environmental impact. Her visit to the US included concerns over the Keystone XL pipeline, as well. In November, acting on a request from the tribe, Edward John, a member of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, visited the Oceti Sakowin protest camp and other areas near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball Rivers in North Dakota. He also met with local law enforcement, he said. Tauli-Corpuz previously called on the US to halt construction of the DAPL. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum defended his state's actions against DAPL protesters. Energy Transfer Partners, the company responsible for the highly-contentious DAPL, says that the pipeline will transport 470,000 barrels of crude oil per day from North Dakota's Bakken shale fields to Illinois. Beginning last year, the DAPL incurred months-long protests originally led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and set up along the pipeline's route, near the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball rivers. The protests camps eventually attracted more than just Standing Rock Sioux Tribe members and those of other Native American tribes. In addition to tribal water supply concerns, the Missouri River is a source of drinking water to millions in the US. The DAPL also represents a continued dependance on fossil fuels, opponents say, which contributes significantly to global climate change. Thousands of people flocked to the area to support the DAPL opposition, leading to hundreds of arrests by at times aggressive, heavily-armed law enforcement.

The Standing Rock Sioux has sued the Army Corps of Engineers and Energy Transfer Partners in federal court. The tribe claims it was not properly consulted on the project, which represented a threat to its health, based on the pipeline's route through its water source off the Missouri River. The tribe also says the project violates treaty rights agreed to in 1868 with the US government. The tribe has argued that the DAPL also threatens its sacred cultural and religious sites in the area. The defendants in the lawsuit dispute these claims. After months of indigenous-led opposition, creating an increasingly tense scene at the protest camps, the Barack Obama administration temporarily halted the project's construction through the area. Upon taking office in January, the Donald Trump administration quickly reversed course and approved of the DAPL's advancement. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

In April, Standing Rock Sioux elder LaDonna Brave Bull Allard established a camp as a center for cultural preservation and spiritual resistance to the pipeline; over the summer the camp grew to thousands of people.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers conducted a limited review of the route and found no significant impact.

URGENT. My friends in Standing Rock just sent this to me & asked me to share it. They are surrounded by militarized police RIGHT NOW. A heroic battle by the Standing Rock Sioux, some 200 other Native American peoples, and many thousands of others has blocked completion of DAPL for nearly a year. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum claimed the state was issued the order to evacuate Oceti Sakowin camp because rising floodwaters could endanger people there and threaten to contaminate the waters of the Missouri because of debris and waste supposedly left in the camp. Most outrageously, the biggest environmental danger is the pipeline itself, which is scheduled to carry 470,000 barrels of Earth-killing oil a day. Photo: AP. Little more than a week later, the Corps dropped its promised environmental impact study of the pipeline and instead granted an easement to Energy Transfer Partners, the conglomerate building the pipeline, to finish it. This easement allows construction of one of the sections of DAPL which most directly threatens the Standing Rock Sioux and the environment: the 1.25-mile section under Lake Oahe, a reservoir on the Missouri River, just north of the current boundaries of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation (and through lands and waters granted to the Sioux nation under an 1851 treaty). North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum claimed the state had issued the order to evacuate Oceti Sakowin camp because rising floodwaters could endanger people there and threaten to contaminate the waters of the Missouri because of debris and waste supposedly left in the camp. This outrageous statement twists truth beyond recognition. First, while this camp is on Army Corps of Engineers land, that land was granted to the Sioux by treaty in 1851 and subsequently stolen by the U.S. government. Pipeline leaks would threaten the water supply of the Standing Rock Sioux, and the 27 tribes and 18 million people downriver who depend on water from the Missouri. On February 1, over 70 water protectors were arrested in a vicious and unjustified government assault. Now these assaults are intensifying, not just aimed at completing the pipeline, but also breaking the powerful resistance that has emerged at Standing Rock against the crimes this system is carrying out against Native peoples, and the accelerating climate crisis, driven in large part by the burning of the fossil fuels DAPL will be carrying. This resistance has resonated with and inspired millions across the U.S. and globally. New bills are being introduced and debated in the North Dakota legislature to increase criminal penalties against those who refuse to leave the protest camp or continue to resist DAPL. Journalists have been targeted, arrested, in some cases strip-searched, and hit with serious charges simply for covering the resistance. There are reports that militarized police are being positioned on high ground near the camp. A different world IS possible.

Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which is leading the courtroom fight to block the pipeline, has also supported the evacuation effort, sparking an intense backlash from other activists.

When Energy Transfer Partners proposed a new 1,200-mile oil pipeline from the Bakken oil fields to the Midwest, it chose a route crossing the Missouri River just yards upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Within days of his inauguration, however, Donald Trump ordered the permits granted. The Tribe filed a lawsuit to challenge this decision, but construction was completed while the case was proceeding. In June, just weeks after pipeline operations had begun, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled for the Tribe that the Army Corps had not complied with environmental review laws before issuing permits for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River. The court ordered separate briefing to assess whether the pipeline should be shut down while the remand process is going on. In a 28-page opinion, the court weighed two factors to determine whether or not the pipeline should be shut down. The court answered that question in the affirmative. Second, it assessed the disruptive consequences if the pipeline were shut down. However, the court found that the first factor was sufficient to rule against shutting down the pipeline. In its legal briefs, the Tribe had asked that if the pipeline were not shut down, then the court should impose additional measures to reduce the risk of oil spills to protect the Tribe. The details and timing of this process will be worked out at a status conference next week. Because the district court case remains live, and the remand process is underway, this is not an appealable decision at this time. The Tribe intends to focus on the remand process and has a technical team of experts assisting it in providing input. The Corps has invited the Tribe to provide input into the remand, and that process is currently underway. The Corps has stated that process should be complete by April of next year.

A spokesman for Mr Trump said he supports construction of the pipeline but would review the situation once in the White House. Oil tanks The developers are rushing to finish the construction of the controversial pipeline because they are under financial pressure, not because of a need for increased local pipeline capacity, argues Clark Williams-Derry of the Sightline Institute, an environmental-research institution. According to court documents oil drillers have the right to void their contracts with ETP if the pipeline is not finished by January 1st, which could result in steep losses for the developers. Mr Williams-Derry argues that the pipeline is a superfluous project being built to preserve the favourable contract terms negotiated by its developers before the oil price tanked. He thinks existing infrastructure can easily handle the transport of Bakken oil. Vicki Granado, a spokesperson for ETP, says January 1st was the original in-service date and denies the company has any contractual obligation tied to the date.

In December, the US Army Corps of Engineers denied pipeline builder Energy Transfer Partners the necessary permission to build the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe in North Dakota, and called for additional environmental review of pipeline routes. The decision arrived after months of protests and legal action led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which contended that the pipeline threatened a key water source. The tribe also argued that consultations around the pipeline, promised in treaties, were left out of the initial pipeline planning. The immediate path at forward for the pipeline is not clear. She believes a rapid reversal of this decision could raise legal questions. In 2015 the Obama administration rejected the Keystone XL pipeline, which was due to carry crude oil 1,179 miles from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska, after years of debate. The State Department denied the permit to builder TransCanada, saying the project did not benefit the national interests of the US in terms of jobs or contributions to the economy, and also presented an environmental threat. The administration's support of both projects cheered petroleum industry supporters. Environmental groups that fought both projects strongly condemned the executive orders Tuesday. The groups argued that the decisions flouted treaty rights to tribes, and risked accelerated harm to citizens and the climate. Submit it here.

Barry Sheppard December 07, 2016 Article originally posted in ESSF Image from Hoodwich Native Americans and their allies won an important battle in their fight to prevent the Dakota Access Pipeline to go through historic tribal lands of the Sioux, and under part of the Missouri River where the Sanding Rock Sioux reservation gets its drinking water. The battle was joined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (ACE), when it issued an ultimatum that the protest at the site where the pipeline is scheduled to go under the river must be disbanded by December 4 or the participants would face arrest and prosecution. In short, the ACE would instruct the state and local police units to attack the water protectors on Dec. 5 unless they left the site by then. That would mean a repeat of the brutal police attacks against the non-violent protest that have already occurred, with clubs, attack dogs, tear gas, rubber bullets, water spraying of protesters with fire hoses in temperatures lower than 10 degrees (-12 C.), stun grenades, and mass arrests. One of these grenades shredded the flesh of the arm of a young woman, a gruesome sight. She is undergoing multiple surgeries. The ACE says it could do this because its operates this federal land, which is a bit outside the reservation. But the Sioux say this land was ceded to them by the U.S. in an 1851 treaty. So the ACE is holding this land illegally because the U.S. arbitrarily broke the treaty, as its has with hundreds of others in its prolonged genocidal war against the first inhabitants of North America. This land also contains sacred burial grounds of the Sioux, some of which have already been bulldozed, a racist insult and desecration to Native Americans. The Standing Rock struggle had already won wide support, but this ultimatum spurred a qualitative new surge of solidarity, with many new supporters coming to North Dakota to put their bodies on the line. By Dec. 3, there were some 10,000 who joined the struggle at Standing Rock, although they faced injury and arrest. In addition, where were protests in many cities against the big multinational banks financing the pipeline. A key aspect of this new surge was veterans of the U.S. armed forces, many Native American but others too, mobilizing to come. They were prepared to form a line of defense between the cops and the protest site. The cops would have to go through them first. By Dec. 3, there were 2,000 veterans ready for the battle. Dec. 5 was a Monday. The article described some of them. Some drove in from reservations across the Plaines. Or they said they were angry at seeing images of violent clashes between lines of law enforcement and Native Americans. The threat of the spectacle of militarized police charging unarmed veterans gave the powers that be cause for concern, and there were a series of retreats, with the ACE backing down from the threats of force. Then on Dec. 4, the ACE (obviously under White House orders) denied Energy Transfer Partners, the company doing the construction, the permit to start building the pipeline underneath the river, officially halting construction. On hearing the news, the encampment broke out into cheers and celebrations, echoed by supporters throughout the country. But the mood was more sober the next day. Energy Transfer Partners reacted to the AEC decision by saying it meant nothing. They implied they might go ahead with the under river construction anyway, but that is uncertain, as it would lead to a direct clash with the federal government. Trump, as Commander in Chief of the armed forces, could order the ACE, part of the Army, to do so. So the water protectors know they may have to re-mobilize. It was the power of mass mobilization that won this battle. Over the last many months of struggle solidarity was built up. First of all, it was the Standing Rock Sioux who united to act. Then other tribes joined in, including from Canada. Eventually over 200 tribes supported the struggle at Standing Rock, overcoming differences in a show of solidarity. This was the largest gathering of Native Americans in struggle since the American Indian Movement of the last radicalization in the U.S. in the 1960s-70s. That they stood up and fought back encouraged others to come in support. Environmental groups recognized this fight against Big Oil was their fight too. Black Lives Matter activists saw a kindred struggle, as did many other groups and individuals. Nothing inspires all oppressed and exploited than to see a mass battle being waged against the ruling class. In the protest camp, a renewed sense of their power was expressed. If there is need for further mobilization, this confidence will give them strength. This spirit will spill over into other struggles, too."}, {"URL": "https://thinkprogress.org/dakota-access-whats-next-c6d8b027abe8#.uc5fkdxqy", "Timestamp": "20180919000932", "Sentences": "House Speaker Paul Ryan is fuming. And Energy Transfer Partners is promising that the Dakota Access Pipeline will go forward as planned. On Sunday, the Army Corps of Engineers determined that one piece of the pipeline needs a full environmental impact study (EIS), a months-long process that looks at whether the line is appropriately sited, where alternative routes could go, and who will be impacted. The EIS is required for a length of the pipeline that would run under Lake Oahe on the Missouri River, a half mile north of the Standing Rock Reservation. On one side, you have money, President-elect Donald Trump, and a network of fossil fuel infrastructure. On the other, you have protesters, lawyers, and time. Trying to Trump this decision would be a bad idea In the immediate aftermath of the announcement, environmentalists were quick to wonder if this was yet another Obama administration decision that the president-elect can reverse come January 20. There is good reason to be concerned. Trump is personally invested in both ETP and a company that will eventually own 25 percent of the completed pipeline. He clearly wants the project to go forward. There is a mountain of paperwork to get through Tribe members and supporters, including many indigenous groups, have been protesting the Lake Oahe section for months, clashing with militarized authorities and drawing national attention to the project. They have also sued the Army Corps over its handling of the permit process. Native American tribes are sovereign states, and permitting agencies are required to consult with the tribes on any environmental issues. Advertisement In addition, it simply makes sense to conduct a full environmental review for a project of this size, said Jan Hassleman, an attorney with Earthjustice who is representing the tribe. The most likely outcome of the EIS is that the pipeline is, in fact, rerouted. There is an alternative route that ETP considered that takes the line 10 miles north of Bismarck. But if it moves ahead with construction without a permit, its bank financing could be at risk, since financing agreements almost always stipulate that the loan party must be in good standing. Market forces are already undermining the financial viability of a pipeline bringing crude oil from North Dakota. But there are multiple market factors at work against the pipeline. Since Dakota Access was proposed in 2014, oil prices have fallen dramatically, even while production from the Bakken formation has decreased. OPEC, the international oil production group, recently agreed to limited production, thrusting global oil prices back up, at least temporarily. Meanwhile, new data from the Energy Information Administration shows that oil exports from the United States have gone up 1,000 percent since 2009. But Williams-Derry said that this current market volatility is, while far from predictive, certainly worrying for investors in the project. The Keystone XL permit rejection opened the doors for a multi-billion dollar lawsuit against the United States. The Shell decision to back out of the Arctic did not stop drilling there. The Paris climate agreement is on shaky ground. But the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe might have just triggered a complete rethinking of how the U.S. government interacts with the Indian nations."}, {"URL": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/24/standing-rock-thanksgiving-jane-fonda-dakota-access-pipeline?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other", "Timestamp": "20180919011042", "Sentences": "Standing Rock: injured protester's father says police account is 'bogus nonsense' Read more Kandi Mosset, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara nation, has mixed feelings about the gesture. asked the 37-year-old who has been at Standing Rock since August.

Dozens of different tribes have gathered at a protest camp near the pipeline construction site in North Dakota, which has led to occasional clashes with police and security guards. Several arrests have been made, with journalist Amy Goodman issued with a warrant after she went to the camp to report on the protests. In total, the pipeline will make 200 river crossings, including the Missouri and Mississippi rivers, in four states. The US army corp of engineers, which has jurisdiction over pipelines that cross major waterways, approved the Dakota Access plan despite warnings from the Environmental Protection Agency that leaking oil could pollute the rivers. The pipeline was originally meant to run near the city of Bismarck, which has an overwhelmingly white population, before objections resulted in it being relocated to a site near Native American land.

Caroline Grueskin, Tribune Buy Now The feeling at camp on Monday was busy but calm. The clash came as protesters sought to push past a bridge on a state highway that had been blockaded since late October, according to the Morton County Sheriff's Office. The attempt escalated into hours of conflict in which protesters reportedly threw rocks and logs at police, who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and cold water. It was the most tense conflict between law enforcement and opponents of the 1,168-mile crude oil pipeline in weeks, and led to at least 26 serious injuries among protesters, according to a camp medical group, and one officer was reportedly hit in the head with a rock. Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier, who said police used fire hoses not water cannons as reported by numerous protesters, said water is not normally used by his department as a method to disperse a crowd. He said field commanders on scene who made the decision to use fire hoses on protesters considered the effect the water would have on people in the cold temperatures. when asked whether the use of force was necessary to keep officers safe. Law enforcement would consider using water again, he said. Kirchmeier said local law enforcement has begun getting federal aid in the form of Customs and Border Patrol officers. Protesters have voiced concerns that a leak in the pipeline would contaminate the Missouri River and Angela Bibens, an attorney who works at the camp, did not miss the irony that people protesting about protecting water were being repelled with it. Bibens said her team was taking statements throughout the day in preparation for a potential lawsuit alleging police brutality. Amnesty International said Monday they would send human rights observes to the pipeline protests, for their fourth visit since August. Treating injuries Michael Knudsen, a member of the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council, was giving medical treatment at the front line of the protest on Sunday night. He said people were suffering mostly from hypothermia, as well as blunt trauma from the rubber bullets and tear gas contamination. Knudsen said ambulances from Standing Rock, Cheyenne River, Kidder and Morton counties were present. According to a release from the medic and healer council, 300 people in total were injured in some form. At least 26 seriously injured people had to be evacuated by ambulance to three area hospitals, according to the release. Sanford Health spokesman Jon Berg said nine people were treated at Sanford but he could not release information on their condition. Cecily Fong, public information officer for the Department of Emergency Services said six were treated at the Fort Yates Hospital. One person was in serious condition at the Hennepin County Medical Center, according to the hospital. Among the most serious injuries were a man who had a seizure, an elder who had to be resuscitated and a woman suffering an eye injury from a rubber bullet to the face, according to the release from the medic and healer council. Protesters criticize the barricade as blocking emergency services and suggest it is being used to prevent access to construction sites just north. North Dakota Department of Transportation spokeswoman Jamie Olson said the department has not received any update from law enforcement on when they might be able to come do testing. She said testing can still be done despite the cooler temperatures but snow or ice would complicate the process. 'Figured it was time' Aidoneus Bishop helped pull one burned vehicle off the bridge Sunday night. He said the move was the end of a two-week-long ritual, in which he would pull a semi-truck up to the burned vehicles as if to tow them, then turn back around to camp. Protesters started arriving to check on what was happening. From there, officers started firing the rubber bullets and more people gathered on the bridge and across the fields to the sides. This led to the long confrontation with police, in which protesters started fires and allegedly threw rocks and burning logs at officers, according to Kirchmeier. Law enforcement responded by spraying the protesters with water and firing rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray into the crowd. Protesters left the bridge late Monday at the request of tribal elders after police warned the crowd that they had found firearms, the Associated Press reported. Bishop said police were reinforcing the barricade with razor wire as protesters retreated. Among the crowd on the bridge Sunday night was Elih Lizama, 24, who stayed for four hours despite several hits from rubber bullets, he said. He fended off some of them with a plastic container lid, which ultimately broke, and then picked up a piece of sheet metal, which he said worked better. He came back to camp after four hours when his girlfriend said it was time. Bismarck Tribune reporter Jessica Holdman and Forum News Service reporter Amy Dalrymple contributed to this article.

The Cheyenne River and the Standing Rock Sioux tribes have sued to stop construction on the final stretch of the Dakota Access pipeline, which would bring oil from North Dakota's rich Bakken fields across four states to a shipping point in Illinois. The tribes say the pipeline threatens their drinking water, cultural sites and ability to practice their religion, which depends on pure water. The last piece of the pipeline is to pass under a reservoir on the Missouri River, which marks the eastern border of both tribes' reservations. The company building the pipeline, Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, has insisted the water supply will be safe. JUDGE TO HEAR ARGUMENTS ON DAKOTA ACCESS PIPELINE WORK Francis didn't cite the Dakota pipeline dispute by name and the Vatican press office said he was not making a direct reference to it. But history's first Latin American pope has been a consistent backer of indigenous rights and has frequently spoken out about the plight of Indians in resisting economic development that threatens their lands. In the waning days of the Obama administration, amid protests over construction that led to some 700 arrests, federal agencies that have authority over the reservoir said they would not give permission for pipe to be laid until an environmental study was done. U.S. President Donald Trump reversed course and last month instructed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to proceed with building the pipeline. Francis' reference to prior consent is enshrined in the U.N. Declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples, which was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 2007 over the opposition of the U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Francis' strong backing for indigenous groups and refugees, his climate change concerns and criticism of the global economy's profit-at-all-cost mentality highlight the policy differences with the Trump administration that may come out if the U.S. president meets with Francis while in Italy for a G-7 summit in May.

If the Keystone XL Pipeline is ever completed, for instance, it will employ about 35 full-time workers, relying for its operation on a vast network of sensors, drones and the like. The number of workers employed in generating solar power now surpasses those employed in the generation of electricity from coal, gas and oil combined. On questions of energy economics, Mr. Trump is stuck somewhere in the Reagan era, when energy independence at any cost was the watchword. Standing Rock, the scene of the battle over the Dakota pipeline, stands with Flint., Mich., as the flash points of environmental racism in our recent history. The Obama administration made a significant stride forward when it took seriously the complaints of Native Americans; Mr. Trump clearly prefers a world where Indians are simply colorful set decorations in the diorama of American history. Each is a complex mix of commercial, political and legal calculation. What is clear, however, is that there will be enormous resistance. Many Indian nations were represented at the Standing Rock camp, and they drew big contingents of clergy members, military veterans and young people as allies.

We've received your submission. Now, a group of advisors to President-elect Donald Trump on Native American issues wants to free those resources from what they call a suffocating federal bureaucracy that holds title to 56 million acres of tribal lands, two chairmen of the coalition told Reuters in exclusive interviews. The tribes have rights to use the land, but they do not own it. They can drill it and reap the profits, but only under regulations that are far more burdensome than those applied to private property. It could deeply divide Native American leaders, who hold a range of opinions on the proper balance between development and conservation. Many Native Americans view such efforts as a violation of tribal self-determination and culture. Reservations governed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs are intended in part to keep Native American lands off the private real estate market, preventing sales to non-Indians. An official at the Bureau of Indian Affairs did not respond to a request for comment. The legal underpinnings for reservations date to treaties made between 1778 and 1871 to end wars between indigenous Indians and European settlers. Tribal governments decide how land and resources are allotted among tribe members. Protesters demonstrate in solidarity with members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota over the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline. AP On Sunday, amid rising opposition, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sunday said it had denied a permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline project, citing a need to explore alternate routes. The Trump transition team has expressed support for the pipeline, however, and his administration could revisit the decision once it takes office in January. Tribes and their members could potentially reap vast wealth from more easily tapping resources beneath reservations. In 2008, the Bureau of Indian Affairs testified before Congress that reservations contained about 20 percent of untapped oil and gas reserves in the U.S. Deregulation could also benefit private oil drillers including Devon Energy Corp, Occidental Petroleum, BP and others that have sought to develop leases on reservations through deals with tribal governments. Those companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. At least three of four chair-level members have links to the oil industry. ETP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The fourth co-chair, Eddie Tullis, a former chairman of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians in Alabama, is involved in casino gaming, a major industry on reservations. Clahchischilliage and Tullis did not respond to requests for comment. BUREAUCRATIC THICKET A service truck drives past an oil well on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota. Reuters Several tribes, including the Crow Nation in Montana and the Southern Ute in Colorado, have entered into mining and drilling deals that generate much-needed revenue for tribe members and finance health, education and infrastructure projects on their reservations. As U.S. oil and gas drilling boomed over the past decade, tribes struggled to capitalize. A 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office found that poor management by the Bureau of Indian Affairs hindered energy development and resulted in lost revenue for tribes. Construction equipment sits near a Dakota Access Pipeline construction site. Over the next decade, some 2.5 million acres of land were removed from tribal control, and 12,000 Native Americans lost their tribal affiliation. Mullin and Swimmer said the coalition does not want to repeat past mistakes and will work to preserve tribal control of reservations. Mullin said the finalized proposal could result in Congressional legislation as early as next year. Washburn said he doubted such a bill could pass, but Gabe Galanda, a Seattle-based lawyer specializing in Indian law, said it could be possible with Republican control of the White House and the U.S. House and Senate. Legal challenges to such a law could also face less favorable treatment from a U.S. Supreme Court with a conservative majority, he said. Trump will soon have the chance to nominate a Supreme Court justice to replace Antonin Scalia, a conservative member who died earlier this year.

Local law enforcement said on Tuesday they planned a blockade of the camp, but local and state officials later retreated, saying they would only check vehicles for certain prohibited supplies like propane, and possibly issue fines. Dalrymple on Wednesday said state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and there had been no plans to block food or other supplies from the camp. He also warned protesters that while emergency responders will try to reach anyone in need, that would be contingent on weather conditions. That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps.

The cause was being investigated. The pipeline transports crude from Alberta, Canada, to refineries in Illinois and Oklahoma, passing through the eastern Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas and Missouri. It can handle nearly 600,000 barrels, or about 23 million gallons, daily. TransCanada says on its website that the company has safely transported more than 1.5 billion barrels of oil, or about 63 billion gallons, through the system since operations began in 2010. There have been over 200 significant leaks in these pipelines since the year 2000. The Project has been defending activists who oppose the Keystone XL pipeline, an extension of the Keystone project, because it passes close to tribal lands and could endanger their drinking supply. TransCanada said in its statement that it expected the pipeline to remain shut down as the company responds to the leak. It did not offer a time estimate. The federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration didn't immediately return an email requesting additional information from The Associated Press. A leak and spill in southeastern South Dakota in April 2016 prompted a weeklong shutdown of the pipeline. TransCanada estimated that just under 17,000 gallons of oil spilled onto private land during that leak. No waterways or aquifers were affected. TransCanada said at the time that the leak was the first detected on the pipeline since it began operating, though there had been leaks at pumping stations. One of those leaks happened in southeastern North Dakota in May 2011, when 14,000 gallons spilled after a valve failed at a pumping station near the South Dakota border. The Keystone Pipeline is part of a 2,687-mile system that also is to include the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which has faced persistent opposition from environmental groups, American Indian tribes and some landowners. President Trump issued a federal permit for the project in March even though it had been rejected by the Obama administration. The project has received needed approvals in states between Alberta, Canada, and Nebraska. Nebraska regulators plan to announce their decision next week. All Rights Reserved.

That will effectively force a reroute of the Dakota Access Pipeline, a project that hundreds of protesters have been demonstrating against for months. Numerous Hawaii activists have been involved in the protests, braving cold, snow and ice to help force attention on the concerns of the Sioux that the pipeline poses a threat to drinking water supplies, among other issues. The Department of the Army and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers made the decision to deny the request for an easement and instead will prepare an environmental impact statement of alternative routes. Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard greets veterans and other protesters at the Standing Rock camp. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose reservation is about a half-mile south of the planned pipeline crossing, also issued a statement expressing gratitude to the Obama administration for its decision. The tribe thanked what it said were thousands of demonstrators who had come to the site and millions of other people around the world for their support. The tribe also expressed hope that the Trump administration would let the decision stand. According to the Corps press release, the Dakota Access Pipeline is an approximately 1,172-mile pipeline that would connect the Bakken and Three Forks oil production areas in North Dakota to an existing crude oil terminal near Patoka, Illinois. The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter and is projected to transport approximately 470,000 barrels of oil per day, with a capacity as high as 570,000 barrels. The decision came as U.S. Rep Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii joined the protesters. She traveled to Standing Rock as part of a movement of veterans who had vowed to protect demonstrators from efforts to evict them as soon as Monday. Just two hours before the Army issued its statement, Gabbard stood on the wind-swept winter prairie, surrounded by dozens of U.S. veterans, some of them dressed in full fatigues. She talked about why it was important to fight alongside the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe to block the construction of the pipeline.

When Energy Transfer Partners proposed a new 1,200-mile oil pipeline from the Bakken oil fields to the Midwest, it chose a route crossing the Missouri River just yards upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Within days of his inauguration, however, Donald Trump ordered the permits granted. The Tribe filed a lawsuit to challenge this decision, but construction was completed while the case was proceeding. In June, just weeks after pipeline operations had begun, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled for the Tribe that the Army Corps had not complied with environmental review laws before issuing permits for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River. The court ordered separate briefing to assess whether the pipeline should be shut down while the remand process is going on. In a 28-page opinion, the court weighed two factors to determine whether or not the pipeline should be shut down. The court answered that question in the affirmative. Second, it assessed the disruptive consequences if the pipeline were shut down. However, the court found that the first factor was sufficient to rule against shutting down the pipeline. In its legal briefs, the Tribe had asked that if the pipeline were not shut down, then the court should impose additional measures to reduce the risk of oil spills to protect the Tribe. The details and timing of this process will be worked out at a status conference next week. Because the district court case remains live, and the remand process is underway, this is not an appealable decision at this time. The Tribe intends to focus on the remand process and has a technical team of experts assisting it in providing input. The Corps has invited the Tribe to provide input into the remand, and that process is currently underway. The Corps has stated that process should be complete by April of next year.

Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines to be revived by Trump administration Read more The Dakota Access pipeline project stalled out more recently, in December 2016, when the US army corps of engineers announced it would not grant a permit for the line to run under the Missouri river at a proposed site in North Dakota. Both pipeline projects have also been mired in court battles. The company behind the Keystone pipeline, TransCanada Corporation, filed two legal challenges in January 2016 accusing accusing Obama of overstepping his authority and violating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The company behind the Dakota Access pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners, asked a federal judge in December to allow it to drill under the Missouri river immediately, despite its failure to win a permit from the army corps. While both pipelines have produced high-profile clashes between environmentalists and energy interests, the conflict over the Keystone pipeline has run for much longer, since Obama first blocked it in early 2012. The plan for the Dakota Access pipeline, which is mostly completed, was presented to the public in 2014.

Resurrection of Keystone and DAPL cements America's climate antagonism Read more Opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline was identified with the Native American protesters who began to set up protest camps in April 2016, warning that a portion of the proposed pipeline route crossed sacred tribal grounds and that the line threatened to contaminate sources of drinking water. The local Standing Rock Sioux tribe and thousands of Native American supporters from across North America eventually set up camps in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, to try and block the oil project. The Keystone project was projected to cost about twice as much. The finished Keystone pipeline would carry tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada, to the Gulf Coast. Defenders of the Keystone project argued that it would create as many as 50,000 construction jobs. The state department estimated the project would create 5,000 to 6,000 construction jobs, while the Obama White House put the figure even lower, at 2,000 construction jobs, and then just 50 to 100 jobs a year.
