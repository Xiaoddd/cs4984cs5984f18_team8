        "Sentences": "A A Environmental and indigenous groups said Thursday they are worried Canada may soon own the Puget Sound Pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in Whatcom and Skagit counties. They are concerned the 69-mile pipeline may be expanded or the amount of oil that flows through it may be increased. They are also worried about plans to expand the larger Trans Mountain Pipeline that runs through Canada and connects with the local pipeline. The Canadian government announced May 29 plans to purchase the Trans Mountain Pipeline system from Kinder Morgan to ensure completion of the planned expansion. That system includes the Puget Sound Pipeline spur. Those four refineries currently receive more than half the oil sent through the Trans Mountain Pipeline across Alberta and British Columbia, according to Kinder Morgan documents. While the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion plan focuses on construction in Alberta and British Columbia, the potential to expand the Puget Sound Pipeline as well is penciled into some Kinder Morgan documents. Local refineries have not said whether the planned Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion or a potential Puget Sound Pipeline expansion would impact them. The Andeavor Anacortes Refinery did not respond to a request for comment. A document filed Feb. 20 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission states that although Kinder Morgan does not have plans to expand the Puget Sound Pipeline, its capacity could be increased from 240,000 to 500,000 barrels per day. In recent years, the pipeline has operated below capacity. Between 2015 and 2017, it moved an average of 180,000 barrels per day to the refineries in Whatcom and Skagit counties, according to Kinder Morgan documents. No plans to expand While there are no current plans to expand the local pipeline, Liestman and several other representatives of environmental organizations and indigenous communities who spoke Thursday said they have concerns about the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion and what it would mean for Washington. Their primary concerns are that the planned expansion would increase tanker traffic in the Salish Sea and increase the amount of oil that would be exported overseas, burned and contribute to climate change. According to Kinder Morgan, the expansion would include building a second pipeline alongside the existing Trans Mountain route between Edmonton, Alberta, and Burnaby, British Columbia. A marine port in Burnaby, near Vancouver, would also be expanded in order to ship more oil overseas, according to Kinder Morgan documents. The Associated Press reported that the number of oil tankers moving oil from Alberta through the Salish Sea would increase from 60 to 400 as a result of the pipeline expansion. Washington Gov. Tribal and environmental leaders in Washington, along with First Nations and environmental leaders in British Columbia, have spoken out against and protested the expansion plans for several years.

        "Sentences": "'The authorities think that we are aggressive and violent. That's not how it is. 'We are not here to become famous or to become rich. She plans to protest against the pipeline until the end. 'This pipeline is not going to go through. Temperatures are expected to drop to 4F in the area next week. 'We might have very little to survive on if we get stuck down here,' she said. 'Money is real tight but I've lived this life and I can survive. I'm not going anywhere. 'We'll find out who is going to go and who is going to stay come the blizzard. My family know I'm part of the movement and there's nowhere else I can be right now. Pictured above is the entrance to Sacred Stone Camp Two Native Americans were killed, a US Marshall was shot and paralyzed and a dozen people were injured during the 71-day protest. She added: 'We are here as one family and one community to pray and stay strong. I tell people who come to the camp, we don't want your drugs or your alcohol, come to be focused and stay humble. The 1,172-mile oil pipeline, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), is in its final stages of construction apart from a section tunneling under Lake Oahe, a half-mile from the reservation. The pipeline will allow half a million barrels of oil to flow from North Dakota to Illinois each day. A snowstorm and 45mph winds have pounded the nearby Standing Rock Indian reservation this week They also contend that millions of people who live downstream from the pipeline are at risk of crude oil leaks and spills. This week, North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple said it was 'probably not feasible' to reroute the pipeline - which was originally intended to run north of the city of Bismarck, around 50 miles from the Sioux tribe's land. There are other smaller, offshoot camps - Sacred Stone, Rosebud and Red Warrior. The camp was founded by a Sioux family in April but now non-native activists outweigh Native Americans. Hundreds of tribes are represented at the camp and their flags line the perimeter and fly from individual dwellings. At one point, numbers were believed to have swelled to around 8,000 but snowstorms and freezing conditions have driven out many who were ill-equipped to withstand the conditions. Rosemary A Schiano a wildlife field biologist is volunteering at Standing Rock. She said that there is a concerted effort going on to make sure people are prepared Schiano, pictured above, said volunteers are working toward winterizing the camp and preparing the elders for the cold Myron Dewey is part of the indigenous effort to tell the story of Standing Rock and defend the sacred burial sites he says the pipeline will disturb Faith Spotted Eagle from the Ihanktonwan Dakota Territory and South Dakota, has been staying at the camp Lana Jack, of the Celilowy'am tribe in Oregon, is in charge of coordinating the donations. She sounded a note of warning after the blizzard this week left many on the camp in dire situations The campsite is littered with flimsy summer tents which have collapsed beneath piles of snow, while stoves and portable heaters are being moved in by those who remain. Tent and teepee walls are being lined with blankets and sleeping bags to retain warmth. People are being drawn to the sacred fires burning at the camp both as a constant source of heat and to listen to drumming, prayers and Native American songs. Vats of free, hot tea are positioned outside a number of tents as an aid to the 'camp cough' which many activists have developed after months in the cold. Around seven free kitchens dish out plates of pasta and stews, cooked and served by volunteers. Entire families are living at the camp including dozens of children, and three babies have been born there. This coming Monday, an eviction notice from the Obama administration will 'close' all lands where the camps have been established. The camps are located on US Army Corps of Engineers land. State officials ordered activists to leave the camp on Monday, due to 'state of emergency weather conditions'. Mary Zeiser is helping the Creative Resistance at the art camp located at Scared Rock Designs by indigenous artists are printed by volunteers on to jackets, T-shirts and patches for those on the frontlines The designs are also shared for free online in the hope that the environmental message spreads beyond Standing Rock Mary said that no matter what happens when the eviction notice comes into effect, she will be standing her ground Many at the camp say they are being misrepresented and claim authorities have engaged in bullying tactics. The Standing Rock tribe filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming that the US Army Corps of Engineers failed to properly consult them. The lawsuit alleged that the Corps were in breach of the Clean Water Act by allowing the pipe to go so close to their reservation. 'The pipeline has destroyed 86 documented burial sites but they are treating us like domestic terrorists. 'We are the original environmental activists. We have been protecting water and the land for generations and now in the 21st century, we are doing the same. At the camp, preparations are underway to bed in for the rest of the winter amid calls by tribal elders for protesters to remain calm. On Thursday, Faith Spotted Eagle, from the Ihanktonwan Dakota Territory in South Dakota, urged activists not to engage in direct actions against the pipeline workers or authorities which could risk the Treaties of Native American tribes. She asked that those at the camp follow the advice of the Oceti Sakowin leadership and remain in ceremonial prayer. But a violent flare-up last month has left many activists feeling the need to be prepared. Water cannons were sprayed on demonstrators in freezing conditions. Smokey, a member of the Sioux Native American tribe, rides the horse Prophecy, a descendant of the horse belonging to war chief Crazy Horse, at the Oceti Sakowin camp Dan Nanamkin of the Colville tribe in Nespelem, Washington waits for the arrival of other Colville tribe members who were traveling from the headwaters of the Missouri River in a dugout canoe to Oceti Sakowin Camp A 21-year-old protester, Sophie Wilansky, was left with an injury which might cause her to lose her arm. Protesters say she was struck by a police flash grenade, while police have suggested that protesters may have caused the explosion. According to the Morton County Sheriff's Department, more than 500 people have been arrested in the last month. One woman has been charged with attempted murder for allegedly trying to shoot dead a cop as one of the camps was cleared. According to the Morton County State Attorney, Red Fawn Falls, 37, fired three shots at police officers and had to have her gun wrestled out of her arm by cops as she was arrested. Falls allegedly hit one officer in the knee which caused it to 'explode' before she was wrestled to the ground. She has now been charged with attempted murder among other offences and faces 20 years in jail. On Thursday, the Morton County Sheriff's Department released video of two female deputies describing how protesters attempted to use ropes and grappling hooks to break the wiring set up to stop trespassing on private property. According to the sheriff's department, the protestors, who identified themselves as veterans, threatened the female deputies saying law enforcement officers 'should be ready for what's coming'. Lana Jack, of the Celilowy'am tribe in Oregon, is in charge of coordinating the donations. She sounded a note of warning after the blizzard this week left many on the camp in dire situations. 'For three days we didn't have any donations, we were completely cut off. We have not been able to keep people warm. I had a 78-year-old man who came in desperate for help after lying out in the cold. 'We had no propane gas tanks to provide heating for elders and families who were collapsing in the snow. She added: 'We were totally lacking but our people have come together. But we don't have the capacity to take care of more people. We need heavy tents, lumber and propane.' Lana claimed that three trucks had been confiscated by police while bringing supplies to Standing Rock from Bismarck. On Tuesday, state officials said anyone bringing prohibited items into the main protest camp would be fined. There had been threats of a physical blockade on the way to the camp but authorities seem to have retreated from that plan. Instead officers will stop vehicles which appear to be heading to Standing Rock with building supplies and food. that there is a concerted effort going on to make sure people are prepared. Kyle Machulski a volunteer builder from Washington State has come to Standing Rock to lend a helping hand in building shelters and residences at Standing Rock She said: 'The winterization crew is working with elders and Lakota people and guests here at Standing Rock. They have put up kitchens, you name it. Everyone is pitching in and doing good work here at Standing Rock. She said that she didn't believe that the harsh weather or the eviction notice would cause many to leave. So nobody's leaving. Small homes, constructed from plywood and padded with insulation, are popping up around the camp. He has spent the past two weeks volunteering projects around the camp approved by elders in order to help winterize living conditions. Flags border the area surrounding the camp, which sits just on the edge of the Standing Rock reservation 'We are working with donated materials that have been delegated for this project in order to help winterize living conditions,' he said. 'Each house is approved by the tribe's elders. Art coordinator Mary Zeiser arrived at the camp two months ago as part of creative direct action group, Ruckus Society. 'Our message is this is a safe space for people to come and heal. Everyone is welcome. We work through a creative resistance.' Designs by indigenous artists are printed by volunteers on to jackets, T-shirts and patches for those on the frontlines. The designs are also shared for free online in the hope that the environmental message spreads beyond Standing Rock. Mary said that no matter what happens when the eviction notice comes into effect, she will be standing her ground. 'No matter what happens on the 5th, I'm staying to defend our art space,' she said. 'This is a sanctuary for expression. I'm staying until the last piece of trash is collected. 'Some people are worried but preparations are being made, such as organized efforts to get mothers and children to safety if something happens. Among them will be Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii who has served two tours in the Middle East and continues to serve as a major with the Army National Guard.

The standoff to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a fever pitch, and this may be our last chance to halt construction before Donald Trump takes office. Militarized law enforcement and private security firms are harassing, assaulting and jailing hundreds of non-violent protesters who are fighting for indigenous rights and to curb climate change. They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do. Ibid."

The creek is 16 miles northwest of Belfield in Billings County, North Dakota and 200 miles west of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. The oil industry is so unreliable. The 783 mile pipeline transports crude oil in the Williston Basin of western North Dakota and eastern Montana, according to the company website. It is not the first time the Belle Fourche Pipeline has had a spill. Over the weekend, they were rewarded with the news that, in response to a lawsuit filed by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the Army Corps of Engineers has denied Energy Transfer Partners a permit to build the pipeline under the Missouri River at the current site, pending an environmental review that could take anywhere from six months to a year.

You must consider the threats it poses to to drinking water supplies, sacred sites and indigenous rights, the likelihood of oil spills along the entire length of the pipeline and the fact that it would exacerbate climate change. By submitting this form, your name, address and comments will be filed with a public agency and become public record. You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. In the face of massive public opposition, Donald Trump just took executive action in an attempt to move forward construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. For the next few weeks, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is accepting public comments to decide what to include in its environmental study on the pipeline. We must tell the Army Corps that the Dakota Access pipeline poses too much of a threat to drinking water supplies, sacred sites, indigenous rights, the environment and our climate to allow construction to resume. Deadline Feb. 20: Tell the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to stop construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. In particular, the Environmental Impact Statement currently being prepared is considering the last part of the pipeline that would cross under the Missouri River, threatening drinking water downstream if a catastrophic oil spill occurs.

We currently have over 2,100 Veterans on the roster. Our goal now is to prioritize this list to Veterans and Civilian personnel involved with operations, planning & onsite execution. next mission could be as early as the 2nd week of December. More to come The funds we raise on this page will go towards providing transportation and supplies for the brave patriots that come and stand with us. We have full support of the Sioux tribe elders and will be cooperating with them every step of the way. Several had to be treated for hypothermia and one protestor who was hit directly with a grenade has reportedly had her arm amputated as a result.

Not if you allow this the be the United States. Please donate and pass this page along to your friends, family, coworkers and community members. It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

Tipis, tents, and a geodesic dome dotted the valley below. Nestled along the Cannon Ball and Missouri Rivers in remote North Dakota, the Oceti Sakowin camp had recently grown to over 7,000 people. The 1,170-mile pipeline is slated to transport crude oil from the Bakken shale fields of North Dakota, through Standing Rock Sioux treaty land, under the Missouri River, and on to Illinois. And so they pray and march and refuse to move. By the time I arrived, the Oceti Sakowin camp had been inundated by supporters from across the country: from the environmental movement, Black Lives Matter, the progressive media, and elsewhere. Yet the Standing Rock struggle remains an indigenous-led one, an historic coming together of first nations. As we drove up to the front gate, the security team that waved us through was a mix of old-timers with American Indian Movement logos safety-pinned to their leather coats and the next generation of indigenous youth from Standing Rock. This is not a vacation. The 10 days I was at the camp, which included the presidential election, were a period of relative calm, as the pictures in the accompanying photo essay suggest. The Army Corps of Engineers was set to announce a major decision on whether to grant an easement to allow Energy Transfer Partners to drill below the Missouri river, and the indigenous leadership wanted to keep prayer-based actions outside of camp to a minimum pending the decision. Those who were digging in for the long haul used the respite to prepare for winter by gathering necessary supplies and winterizing their shelters. Each night, temperatures plummeted, a dusting of white frost blanketing the tents. This is not a vacation. This was also a time of prayer and ceremony, which people at camp described as part of an essential process of personal and collective healing, helping them to stay strong in the face of the long struggle ahead. Even the marches and demonstrations were always peaceful and prayer-inflected. According to a report from Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with the Indigenous Environmental Network, the protectors were attempting peacefully to move a burned-out truck off the bridge and clear access to the public roadway when police trapped them on the bridge and opened fire with tear gas, rubber bullets, mace canisters, and concussion grenades. Jerky video from the scene shot by witness Kevin Gilbertt shows the police blasting water cannons into the crowd in sub-freezing temperatures. People lost consciousness and dropped to the ground as the freezing water hit; an elder went into cardiac arrest and was revived on site by medics, according to a press release issued by the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. It also reports that at least 300 people were injured, with 26 people requiring immediate hospitalization. One of them, Sophia Walinsky, is facing amputation after a concussion grenade reportedly exploded on her left arm. While this level of brutality and violence against peaceful demonstrators is clearly extreme, it was not the first time the water protectors have been met by blunt force and intimidation. Nor is it likely to be the last. Native peoples in this country have faced every tool the US government has to displace, dispossess, and destroy them for more than 500 years. Yet as the winter comes, the water protectors are not giving up. Their movement is part of a long history of struggle.

        "Sentences": "15 November 2016 The United States is using excessive force against protestors in North Dakota who are trying to stop an oil pipeline project that runs through land sacred to indigenous peoples, according to a United Nations human rights expert. The North Dakota National Guard, law enforcement officials, and private security firms have used unjustified force in their response to opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline, said Maina Kiai, the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association. He is concerned over both the scale of arrests and the conditions in which American citizens are being held. Protestors have reported facing rubber bullets, teargas, mace, compression grenades, and bean-bag rounds while voicing their concerns over the environmental impact of the pipeline and throughout their attempts to protect burial grounds and other sites that are sacred to the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Construction of the pipeline has continued despite the fact that in September, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous Peoples called for its end. The tribe has been denied access to information and was excluded from consultations during the planning stages. The 1,172 mile (1,890km) pipeline is designed to carry crude oil to a refinery near Chicago and is being built by the US Army Corps of Engineers and Energy Transfer. Protestors say that several sacred sites of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe have already been bulldozed. Construction work is now nearing the Missouri River, home to other sacred sites. Protestors believe that the project will create a major threat to the quality of their drinking water. Maina Kiai is from Kenya and was appointed Special Rapporteur on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and association in May 2011. He is part of the Special Procedures of the UN Human Rights Council, the largest body of independent experts in the UN Human Rights system. The positions are honorary and they are not UN staff, nor do they receive a salary for their work."

        "Sentences": "Despite a media blackout and brutal suppression, native people have won an historic and just victory through bravery and humbling perseverance, and that victory has also struck a blow for a world where preventing climate change and preserving our common home takes precedence over enriching the tiny minority of investors in the oil industry. The Army Corps will apparently research alternate routes for the pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners could sue to repeal the refusal, the Trump administration could reverse the Corps. The Army wants the water protectors to clear out, but many are digging in to stay and ensure that the decision sticks. At best, this encampment could be the seed of a new post-Trump resistance that fuses the Occupy movement and movements for justice for indigenous people like Idle No More. But others voiced caution, noting the incoming Republican president and hints that the energy company will appeal the decision. Grassrope added that the tribes would not give up either. In 1914, the British were seeking intelligence about German troop numbers and movement in Belgium. So they parachuted homing pigeons into the region from balloons and planes. Microwave weapons, experts say. The military is now conducting tests on different body sizes to ensure women serving as pilots get the same safety benefits.

        "Sentences": "Today's State Department endorsement of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline certainly boosts President Donald Trump's already-gaudy credentials as a world class climate change denier, but it's not clear that it will accomplish much of anything else. On paper, the TransCanada Corporation now has the Trump administration's blessings to add hundreds of miles of pipeline to allow hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude produced by the Alberta tar sands to flow daily into the U.S., a permission twice denied by President Barack Obama two years ago (by veto and by outright denial of its permit), but it's premature to assume the project will actually get built. The international market for oil isn't what it once was. Prices have fallen, and that's a particularly big issue for oil extracted from tar sands which is more expensive (not to mention environmentally damaging) to produce. And the State Department permit is not the only snag. There are lawsuits by property owners in Nebraska which also must issue a permit and where concerns have been expressed about protecting underground water reserves. There are likely to be further protests mounted by Native Americans and environmentalists in South Dakota, Montana and Nebraska as there have been around the Dakota Access Pipeline. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau may have supported the project in the past, but he also must be mindful of his country's overall greenhouse gas emissions and meeting nationwide limits Canada promised in the Paris climate agreement. The Canadian government has already approved other pipeline projects that are essentially using up its cap space, including an expansion of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain Pipeline that runs to the country's west coast. That raises the distinct possibility that by focusing on backward-looking energy polices (his promise to revive the U.S. coal industry providing the other glaring example), Mr. Trump isn't boosting jobs, he's costing the U.S. important economic opportunities. The more we encourage and accommodate needless greenhouse gas emissions by other nations, the quicker the bill for those decisions is coming due. So much of the Keystone XL project's merits have been overstated. While there may be thousands of construction jobs created on a temporary basis, a 2015 analysis concluded that Keystone will produce just 50 permanent jobs in the U.S. If Keystone merely enables TransCanada to sell its oil on the international market somewhat faster than before, the only tangible effect will be to compound the effects of climate change as the oil is consumed. And even if President Trump and others respond by doing no more than sticking their collective heads further in the sand, the costs associated with climate change from higher temperatures and sea level rise to stronger hurricanes and worsened droughts will dwarf any possible short term benefits of allowing oil and gas producers to run wild. We support job-producing infrastructure investment but not at so high a price. This is short-sighted, self-destructive behavior on the part of president who won't listen to reason or scientific evidence. The only good news is that perhaps Mr. Trump's stamp of approval comes too late to rescue a project that makes even less sense today than it did in 2008."

Blessings to all people daring to stand up against oppression and the rape of Mother Earth. Bob Talley 1 year ago Janice E. Mitich, thank you for your post. Very well said. Shadow Wolf 1 year ago The inciting a riot charge against Chase Iron Eyes is egregious. Simply because he was present at the camp. He had every right to be there, to express his Creator given right to the First Amendment. The Morton County Sheriff Office have no credibility whatsoever. Especially after they tried deleting all the evidence leading up to that Nov. bloody incident. Also, he was unarmed and posed no personal threat to the hired thugs in riot gear. Unlike the Bundy Clowns and their cowardly Malheur Wildlife Refuge terrorists. Meh 1 year ago I am not to be a judge as I was not present to witness. Past happenings of injustice seem to be prevalent and still abound. I especially would like to echo and thank the writer izopnyde for I am also too old to run, so I will do my best to follow and try to understand. I hope in Native American culture that counts as a dance. Takesha 1 year ago I have never met Chase Iron Eyes, but I would way this in a court of law under oath. I have viewed a hundred videos of this man, and not once did I hear him curse or speak disrespectfully to anyone. I never have seen him show anger, he always speaks with knowledge, kindness and softly, even when there is a strong truth that needs to be spoken. He encourages people not to follow him, but to stand on their own to feet before the Creator, whomever they believe him to be, and to stand for what is right, what is pure, what is scared, and encourages them not to speak with his voice but their own, to love, to honor others even if they hate us. He is an lawyer, and educator of the people about the Indian Way and the Constitution of the United States. I speak the truth, unlike the those who are making the accusations, Chase Iron Eyes, did not incite a riot. He has said many times, he is not a chosen leader by any tribe he is but a single person, doing what is right to protect the water from avaricious,unscrupulous men who hide behind the names of an oil company, a governors office, and a police badge. What he is, like many others, is a man of principal, a prime example of an American who knows his rights and as they were given to him by the Constitution of the United States. He is a husband, and a father, a provider for his family. He exercises his rights in a non-violent way and cautions other to do the same. He is a target of the State and Federal law enforcement agencies. I give a word of caution here, whatever Chase Iron Eyes has done in the past, he has paid the price for it numerous times over. He is not the man the state and federal government has, and is, trying to present him to be. This is a sham, a travesty, and a lie. I am disgusted with the government which is not of the people, for the people or by the people. I send prayers, and I stand and dance for your freedom and safety. Will they the law and ect ever leave Native Americans its not their land why cant they honor treaties. Prayers brother Gene 1 year ago Good News: As of today, no Water Protectors have been found guilty of felony charges, none have been sentenced to spend time in jail, and over 30 Water Protectors have had misdemeanor charges dismissed for lack of evidence.

Overzealous law enforcement officials in North Dakota have jailed journalists and celebrities who were exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech and the press by documenting police attacks on protesters.

The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of over 200 other tribes from across the Americas are leading the resistance to protect sovereign land and drinking water from destruction by the fossil fuel industry. However, in an attempt to quell these historic nonviolent protests, Gov.

This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure.

That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient.

Jensen discovered the spill while harvesting wheat on Sept. 29, 2013, on his farm near Tioga. It was almost two weeks after Jensen reported the spill that state officials told the public what had happened, and only after The Associated Press asked about it. Tesoro blames a lightning strike for causing the rupture. The 35-mile long pipeline was restarted last November. The pipeline now has leak-detection equipment installed, and frequent aerial and ground inspections are being done. Jensen blames the company for not detecting the leak. Some 20,600 barrels of oil were determined to have spilled. A barrel is 42 gallons. The state Health Department, which is monitoring the cleanup, said no water sources were contaminated and no wildlife was hurt from the spill. Dave Glatt, chief of the agency's environmental health section, said Tesoro has not been sanctioned for the incident. Cleanup crews have recovered about 6,000 barrels of oil, though more than 14,000 barrels are lost, officials said. Crews initially burned oil from the surface and later used vacuums to recover it. That proved ineffective after the oil seeped far underground, officials said. Tesoro now is using a thermal desorption process that involves excavating contaminated soil and heating it before being replaced. University scientists from North Dakota are studying the soil and plan to plant a test crop there next year, state and company officials said. Jensen is optimistic that he'll be able to farm the land someday. Produced in the field and neatly organized by topic, from spring prep to post-harvest."

The BBC's North America editor says a US strike could be imminent. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has said Bashar al-Assad should have no role in a future Syria. His comments signal an apparent U-turn for the US - only last week the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said Washington was no longer prioritising the removal of the Syrian president. Dozens of people, including at least 27 children, are reported to have died following an attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in Idlib province early on Tuesday. Syria denies its forces were to blame and is supported by its ally, Russia. Military action looks certain: Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor It is a clear and pretty dramatic shift. A month ago, Bashar al-Assad in the eyes of the US was part of the solution, considered useful in the fight against so-called Islamic State. Then yesterday, President Trump said his position had changed, that the Assad regime had crossed many lines. The implication was that there could be military action. But given everything that's been said in the past 24 hours, I would say military action looks certain and could be imminent. We could wake up tomorrow morning and find out the Americans have taken action. Cast your mind back to what President Trump said about Barack Obama, when the then president said a red line had been crossed and he did nothing about it afterwards. He heaped derision on President Obama. If Mr Trump were not to act now, he would look weak and he wouldn't want that. Father grieves for twins killed in Syria UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, asked if he was concerned about possible US military action in Syria, said his priority was to ensure accountability for the deadly gas attack. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Rescue workers said clinics treating the wounded in Khan Sheikhoun were hit by air strikes Evidence has mounted that the victims of the attack in Khan Sheikhoun were killed with a nerve agent such as Sarin. Syria has denied dropping chemical weapons from the air while Russia has argued that the mass poisoning was caused by an air strike on a rebel weapons dump where chemical weapons were being stored. But the claims have been viewed with scepticism from the US and its allies. Syria says it would only accept a UN investigation into the incident if a list of conditions are met.

        "Sentences": "Stover, 54, likes living out here in the country on U.S. Highway 51, between the tiny villages of Vernon and Patoka. His closest neighbor is the tank farm, a sprawling complex of enormous white steel tanks that are nearly 4 stories tall. Each can hold upwards of a quarter of a million gallons of crude oil. Business had been good on this grey winter day. Somewhere, on the other side of tall security fences, that infamous pipeline will join a busy underground hub. Crude oil already flows into the tank farm through the Keystone, Enbridge and Capline pipelines. The oil leaves through outgoing pipes that transport it north and east to about a dozen refineries in Illinois, Ohio, and West Virginia. One pipeline heads west, to the Phillips 66 facility in Wood River. Thousands of demonstrators joined with the Standing Rock Sioux to protest the location of the pipeline in North Dakota. In September, a small group protested at the tank farm. Loading... But Stover has seen few demonstrators. He says the tank farm has been a good neighbor. I know they maintain it well. Stover has little interaction with the tank farm workers, but at Christmas, they bring over a gift basket. Or, the heavy trucks that rumble past on their way to the tank farm. Shortly after taking office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that lifted a previous order by former President Barack Obama that had called for a review by the Army Corps of Engineers. Construction in North Dakota resumed last week. In Illinois, where the pipeline crosses nearly 180 miles and 12 counties, construction was met with little opposition, though Illinois conservationists have expressed environmental concerns. A report by the nonprofit Prairie Rivers Network, for example, found that the pipeline crosses under more than 50 rivers, big and small, in the state and could put the water supplies of nearby towns at risk should there be a spill. And spills do occur. The village, founded as a railroad town in 1854, has a population of about 560, according to the U.S. Census. Everyone knows everyone. Country singer Drew Baldridge, a rising star in Nashville, was one of 17 graduates in the Class of 2010. He filmed a video in town a few years ago. And the oil companies and their employees contribute time and money to community projects. Once construction is complete, tank farms operate with small workforces. So, many Patoka residents commute to jobs in larger nearby towns, like Vandalia, Salem or Centralia. Like many small rural towns, Patoka has lost population and businesses in recent years, Brumfield said. ADM has a grain elevator in the village. Our grocery stores are gone. We used to have an auto body shop. We used to have pizza places. We had a flower shop. An exception is Foltz Welding, a Patoka business that began in the 1990s. Foltz is a pipeline contractor that builds pump stations and does maintenance work for various pipeline companies. The company works all over the country, but it does not lay pipeline cross-country, said Jeff Lauritzen, operations manager at Foltz. He said his company has built a large portion of the tank farm. Foltz keeps about 50 or 60 people employed, he said, adding that his company employed over 400 people last year, when seasonal and temporary construction workers are included. Tank farms help move the volume of oil that Americans use in products ranging from gasoline to hair products, Lauritzen said. People expect to see lots of farmland in Illinois, so the tank farm is a striking sight, even on a Google satellite map. From the air, the 60 or so tanks look like white buttons on a crazy quilt of corn and soybean fields. According to Genscape, a company that monitors oil inventories, Patoka has a storage capacity of more than 18 million barrels. During World War II, the federal government divided the nation into five Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts, or PADDs. Patoka is the second-largest oil storage site in PADD 2; the largest is Cushing. Well, it helps to know that a century ago, oil was king in Marion County. In January 1938, oil was discovered on the Glenn Merryman farm, a half-mile south of Patoka. Soon there were derricks all over the countryside, and by the end of the year, Illinois was producing 7.5 million barrels of oil. Jim Watson of the Illinois Petroleum Council says that geography had a lot to do with it. You have a major tank farm and switching point in Cushing, Oklahoma. Then you have the one in Patoka. He believes that, because oil was being produced in Marion County, there was already a storage footprint there, and from there the tank farm grew. Treffert lives in Vernon, where the population was 129 in the 2010 census. Lots of grain farming. Your soybeans. Your corn. Some milo. The little park has a life-size statue of a Union Army soldier, playground equipment and picnic benches. From her back door, Treffert has an unobstructed view of the storage tanks, about a half-mile away. People around here, we just sort of stick to ourselves. To see more, visit KWMU-FM."

But we have the collective financial power as consumers and account holders to stop the pipeline. We must call on these banks to divest from this massive project immediately before Trump can approve the construction of the pipeline. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline. As of Jan. 1, ETP has effectively failed to meet its contractual obligations to deliver oil through the Dakota Access pipeline. Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline. By staying invested in these projects, these 17 banks are tacitly waging a coordinated campaign to destroy sacred Native lands and silence peaceful protest. This could be our last shot at stopping the Dakota Access pipeline before Donald Trump takes office on January 20. We stood with the water protectors and our allies in the climate justice movement to put a halt to the pipeline once before, and we must stand with them again to shut this project down for good. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do."

Militarized law enforcement and private security firms are harassing, assaulting and jailing hundreds of non-violent protesters who are fighting for indigenous rights and to curb climate change. They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do. Ibid."

Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of CREDO activists who stood with our indigenous and climate movement allies in North Dakota, we temporarily blocked construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, but our fight to stop the pipeline once and for all is not yet over. But we have the collective financial power as consumers and account holders to stop the pipeline. We must call on these banks to divest from this massive project immediately before Trump can approve the construction of the pipeline. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline. As of Jan. 1, ETP has effectively failed to meet its contractual obligations to deliver oil through the Dakota Access pipeline. Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline. By staying invested in these projects, these 17 banks are tacitly waging a coordinated campaign to destroy sacred Native lands and silence peaceful protest. This could be our last shot at stopping the Dakota Access pipeline before Donald Trump takes office on January 20. We stood with the water protectors and our allies in the climate justice movement to put a halt to the pipeline once before, and we must stand with them again to shut this project down for good. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do."

        "Sentences": "Sadly, however, apathy has seemed overwhelmingly abundant in our First-World-problem-afflicted iPhone realities. The disheartened impressions I previously had of students and America turned 180 degrees after seeing people flock to the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and North Dakota. For most of my life, as I am in my fourth decade of existence (41 yrs. I have experienced racism because people see my dark skin complexion before my Irish side, or elite college experience, or PhD. Regrettably, the world is replete with experiences we cannot witness firsthand with our senses. But we can begin to structurally analyze the systemic issues that shape our planet. We now exist in a capitalist world that allows entities called corporations to push commodities upon the people for the sake of profit for the few, much like the days of feudalism when the wealthy elite were kings, queens, and aristocrats living in castles, while the poor were relegated to throwing their poop onto the streets. The common people get pushed and pulled into wars and battles mystified by ideologies and narratives that keep people divided or apathetic. Standing Rock, as a pivotal moment, epitomizes the struggle and opens the door for a truer historical understanding, one that recognizes that America was built off of slavery and indigenous land dispossession. As you can see in this essay, I do not intend to zero in on a more particular narrative involving the struggles of the Standing Rock Sioux against the corporate interests of the entity known as DAPL. Instead, I implore those of you reading this short composition to examine the issue, to see the coverage, or lack thereof, of this issue in the mainstream media. If you know little of these topics, question why this is the case. In answering these questions, your journey should yield more questions, leading you down a path that avoids apathy. I attended Andover High School and graduated in the class of 1993. This was much like the other mascot issues that confront American Indians, such as the Washington Redskins. It was a tremendous learning experience, one that afforded me an understanding of how to maneuver and operate in a contentious, hostile, and demoralizing political climate. The act of engaging in civil debate and political action is incredibly important. Nothing could be more satisfying than learning of your work and engagement in issues affecting the world we live in. Apathy versus action can frame a narrow view of reality, but learning of your involvement gives me hope for our nation, and I applaud you for resisting the apathy that goes hand-in-hand with the anti-intellectualism in America.

The bus burst into flames just minutes later. One student had breathing difficulties from the smoke and another injured their ankle when leaving the bus. Care: Rockwood has already begun to investigate the bus failure, meeting with Durham School Services, who provided the bus, to discuss the cause of the engine failure and how to prevent it in the future. Care: President-elect Donald Trump currently holds stocks in Energy Transfer Partners, who is building the pipeline. Energy Transfer Partners had promised to build the pipeline without an alternate route. There are finite amounts of fossil fuels such as natural gas, coal, and oil. In the case of oil and natural gas, it is possible for the generation in high school and college right now to see those fuels run out completely. Protests are expected to continue and could be something the next President has to address if he chooses to reverse the ruling. International: Know: A 6.5 magnitude earthquake hit the province of Aceh in northern Indonesia and killed at least 97 people, Dec. 7. Inform: The earthquake destroyed businesses, mosques, homes and a large hospital in the epicenter, located in the town of Pidie Jaya. The earthquake struck early in the morning, so buildings collapsed on top of an unknown amount of sleeping civilians. There are still people trapped under rubble, so the death toll is expected to rise even more. Care: The St. Louis area sits on the New Madrid fault line, which produced a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in 1811, the largest in U.S. history, and has a seven to ten percent chance potential of producing a large earthquake again in the future. There is no way to predict an earthquake but following an earthquake protocol plan is one way to be prepared for one. One word to describe her: independent."

Oil. First Nations. Standing Rock. Mama Earth. As many of you know, the Black Snake also known as the Dakota Access Pipeline, is trying to make its way through the sacred land of the Standing Rock Sioux in North Dakota. This is about WATER. For Black, White, Red, Yellow, Brown. All Colors. All Nations. All Tribes. In many ways, I see that we can turn the struggle against the Dakota Access Pipeline into a blessing. A blessing that can wake us all up to the horrors of corporate greed that functions at the expense of our natural resources. A blessing to make all of us come together, no matter who we are and where we came from, to stand up and say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. A blessing of learning to let go of selfishness and greed, to come together for the greater good. But we can stand up where ever we are to show our support and solidarity in many ways. Written by my friend Aaron Edwards and myself, this song is inspired by the land of Standing Rock and all of the warriors out there on the front lines laying down their lives for WATER. But these mountains need their own water in the form of food, tents, blankets, and other materials in order to keep standing tall against the black snake. We are offering this song to help provide them with these things. Our love and prayers are with all people across the earth who are victims of corporate greed and power.

Like some Soviet Realist painter, Mr. Trump seems to have an image stuck in his head of brawny men building a nation. Image Opponents of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines protested near the White House on Tuesday. If the Keystone XL Pipeline is ever completed, for instance, it will employ about 35 full-time workers, relying for its operation on a vast network of sensors, drones and the like. The number of workers employed in generating solar power now surpasses those employed in the generation of electricity from coal, gas and oil combined. On questions of energy economics, Mr. Trump is stuck somewhere in the Reagan era, when energy independence at any cost was the watchword. Standing Rock, the scene of the battle over the Dakota pipeline, stands with Flint., Mich., as the flash points of environmental racism in our recent history. The Obama administration made a significant stride forward when it took seriously the complaints of Native Americans; Mr. Trump clearly prefers a world where Indians are simply colorful set decorations in the diorama of American history. Each is a complex mix of commercial, political and legal calculation. What is clear, however, is that there will be enormous resistance. Many Indian nations were represented at the Standing Rock camp, and they drew big contingents of clergy members, military veterans and young people as allies. Farmers and ranchers across the heartland are far more sophisticated than they were a decade ago in standing up to eminent domain actions by foreign corporations. There will be a major gathering in the capital on April 29 to demand a clean energy revolution. Temperatures around the planet are rising, and rising fast; we may be weeks away from observing an iceberg the size of Delaware dropping off the edge of the Antarctic. In the real, fact-based world the pressure for change will become impossible to resist, and the only question is who will get to lead, and benefit from, the transition.

One of the forms in which the working class exists today is at the various nodal points along global supply chains. HISTORY OF THE PROJECT The project's precursor was an informal group formed in San Francisco, California in the aftermath of the events of September 11, 2001. The original purpose was to research changes in the world political economy; one subgroup studied Islamism and the changes in geopolitical inter-capitalist tensions; the other subgroup researched and attempted to intervene in class struggle. In October 2012 we regrouped as the Global Supply Chains class when we helped co-found the Bay Area Public School. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT Capitalism relies on an integrated infrastructure of production clusters and transportation networks, comprised of ports, warehouses, rail lines, highways, information grids and investment vehicles in order to produce and circulate goods. The physical nodes are arrayed in clusters of factories, warehouses, logistics services, and retail, all tied together by maritime, rail, trucking, and telecom networks. These networks generate flows of commodities and information with ever-increasing speed, as the system strives for just-in-time production and inventory-less distribution for a unified global market. Our project demonstrates how these nodes, clusters, networks, corridors and flows are interconnected within an integrated system of production, distribution and consumption. In providing useful and accessible real time information about conflicts along global supply chains, we aim to facilitate class-based collective action that forges connections and solidarity among related struggles. Our ultimate vision is a world beyond capitalist production and supply chains. In our experience, the ideal outcome is further questions, rather than facile answers.

They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do. Ibid."

        "Sentences": "The Seaway pipeline near the tiny North Texas town of Blue Ridge spewed about 600,000 gallons of crude into the air after a subcontractor ruptured it. Local news KXII News 12 in Sherman reports that the Blue Ridge spill was caused by a subcontractor who hit the pipeline with a tractor during a road widening construction project. Video of the spill shows a geyser spouting oil from the pipe several feet into the air and landing on U.S. Highway 121, causing local law enforcement to shut down the road. Of course, local officials have claimed minimal environmental impact in the spill and zero impact to the local drinking water. Enterprise is based in Houston, Texas. Enbridge is based in Canada. What was not widely reported at the time was the fact that the Seaway pipeline had experienced a leak at a hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, just three months earlier in late October. KOCO News 5 in Oklahoma states that the spill in Cushing released less than 50,000 gallons of oil and was quickly contained. Fox 4 News reports that although a man identified as an employee of Enterprise barred people from crossing the highway to the Blue Ridge spill, Plano-based environmental activist Jesse Puente was able to cross over and examine the pipeline spill, where he found pools of oil mixed with water. The Trump administration approved the Dakota Access pipeline just days after the Blue Ridge accident, angering the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and environmental activists known as water protectors. According to a study by Auburn University, if an oil pipeline bursts, it can create a serious health hazard for those who live near it. Crude oil, which is the type of oil spilled near Blue Ridge, contains more than 1,000 chemicals hazardous to humans, such as the carcinogen benzene. It is this reason that the Standing Rock Sioux have fought against the DAPL since last spring. While the Blue Ridge pipeline trails along a major highway in Texas, the DAPL is set to go under Lake Oahe, which provides water to Standing Rock and to millions of people down river. If the DAPL bursts beneath Lake Oahe, the oil and the chemicals in it could leach into the water, rendering it undrinkable. Two months ago, another oil pipeline 150 miles from Standing Rock burst, spilling oil and chemicals into the water, according to a piece in the Inquisitr. Although the Blue Ridge Seaway pipeline accident is far from Standing Rock, it is just one in a series of thousands of pipeline incidents in the last 20 years."

We currently have over 2,100 Veterans on the roster. Our goal now is to prioritize this list to Veterans and Civilian personnel involved with operations, planning & onsite execution. next mission could be as early as the 2nd week of December. More to come The funds we raise on this page will go towards providing transportation and supplies for the brave patriots that come and stand with us. We have full support of the Sioux tribe elders and will be cooperating with them every step of the way. Several had to be treated for hypothermia and one protestor who was hit directly with a grenade has reportedly had her arm amputated as a result. Everyday becomes more evident that the defenders of America must stand with the Water Protectors. Let's stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home. Not if you allow this the be the United States. Please donate and pass this page along to your friends, family, coworkers and community members. It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

Commissioners, who supported the project unanimously, said Sacagawea Pipeline Co. is taking several steps to minimize potential impacts to the lake, including boring at least 100 feet under the lakebed. The 70-mile pipeline will transport oil from south of Keene in McKenzie County to a rail terminal near Palermo in Mountrail County. Commission Chairwoman Julie Fedorchak said the company has hired one of the top contractors in the country to do the underground boring. In addition, the pipeline will be continuously monitored from a control center in Oklahoma and the operator will have personnel and equipment stationed nearby for emergency spill response. The Three Affiliated Tribes consented to an easement for the portion of the project that crosses tribal land, Fedorchak said. The commission is considering another proposal from Sacagawea Pipeline Co. for an eight-mile pipeline that would transport oil from the Palermo rail terminal to the Enbridge oil terminal in Stanley.

        "Sentences": "With one call to local law enforcement, companies can have victims of their workplace crimes sent out of the country at the expense of taxpayers. It has become far too easy for these companies to manipulate the deportation system as a weapon against their employees, threatening retaliatory deportation of immigrant workers who try to organize or speak out about wages and working conditions. Bad employers send a powerful, chilling message in the workplace when they deport employees for speaking out. The result is that too many workers are treated as second class and are too susceptible to abuse. The fear of deportation is real. Recently, a group of workers employed on a public workers project in the Washington, DC area came together and organized to protest reported wage theft by their employer, only to have their immigration status used in retaliation against them. As a result, more than half of the workers were fired and many workers and their family members were placed in deportation proceedings. By driving down labor standards to the lowest common denominator, they make it harder to enforce laws and standards even for native-born workers, and harder for employers who play by the rules to remain competitive. Not surprisingly, most Americans are against the deportation of workplace whistleblowers. Communities and commonsense policymakers have had enough of the deportations. signed the TRUST Act into law last weekend, a bill that gives law enforcement much more leeway to respond to immigration detainer requests and sets a minimum standard to ensure that those with most low-level, non-violent offenses are not wastefully held for deportation purposes. All month, immigration advocates have held vigils, concerts, forums, and protests demanding Congressional action. This weekend, thousands more are planning a massive civil disobedience in Arizona aimed at shutting down Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the day. When immigrant workers have rights and everyone competes on a level playing field, workers across the board do better. We need to stand up for immigrants who work in unsafe, abusive jobs with the constant threat of deportation hanging over them. By doing so, we stand up for the rights of all workers.

Sacred Stone Camp Cast iron stove Amazon With cold weather approaching, Sacred Stone Camp is in need of firewood, as well as woodstoves, propane and fire extinguishers. Because of lack of solar and wind energy at the camps, burning wood and gas will be the primary source of warmth (for both bodies and cooking) in the winter months.

Sacred Stone Camp has also created an Amazon wish list to assist you in your purchasing of supplies. Oceti Sakowin Camp Bracing for winter, the Oceti Sakowin Camp has a similar need for propane, heating stoves and cold weather attire, as well as bulk food supplies to be stockpiled for winter, as their current stock of bulk food is dwindling or expiring. Pick up a few extra cartons of rice or preserved meats on your next Costco trip and ship them to Oceti Sakowin Camp, P.O.

Washington resident Ben Sittingbull has set up a donation page to fill a trailer with thousands of pounds of donated organic food. Students and activists near Madison, Wisconsin, activists from Santa Cruz, California, San Francisco, Los Angeles and beyond, as well as Texas-based hot dog restaurant Frank and plenty more concerned people and businesses across the country have volunteered their time and services to collect food and deliver it or ship it to Standing Rock. All it takes is some time and organization to involve your community in a fundraiser and drive to collect supplies and express solidarity with Standing Rock en masse. And, of course, you can donate funds directly to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, which will be allocated appropriately to support the on-the-ground efforts. All rights reserved."

The state of North Dakota issued an emergency evacuation last week for the main camp, formerly known as Oceti Sakowin, that goes into effect today. While the Governor says this evacuation is for the safety of the people and the river, we know better than to believe these claims. Ironically, the Governor also voiced his concerns about flooding and how this puts people at risk. Flooding is happening sooner than anyone anticipated due to warmer-than-normal temperatures. This is why the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, The Indigenous Environmental Network and Native Organizers Alliance among many others have called for Native Nations Rising: Rise with Standing Rock on March 10 in Washington D.C. Our mission is to carry the momentum Standing Rock started to other Indigenous communities and to focus not just on the rights of one tribe but of all Native Nations. March with us. Rise with Native Nations. Click here to sign up and learn more. As another transition takes place for the camps and for this movement, it seems like a good opportunity to reflect on how and why this movement began, what we learned, and where we are going next. Three Lessons from Standing Rock 1. We Need to Work Together This movement taught us that we need to work together, that it no longer works to organize or work in silos as if our issues are separate. Respecting Indigenous rights means climate justice, self-determination for Indigenous Peoples means water systems and ecosystems will be protected for generations, and respecting treaties goes go hand in hand with respecting the rights of Black and Brown people across this nation. 2. We Are Powerful We also learned or we were reminded that collectively we can change history. One tactic of colonization that has been used to eliminate our existence is erasure. Excluding our narratives from history books, media, you name it. With Standing Rock and with the sustained support from our allies, the Indigenous voice became apart of mainstream news and media. Because of this, millions of people, not just in America but across the world, can never unknow what they know now. Together we broke the pattern of erasure.

Indigenous People Must Lead Finally, we learned that Indigenous Peoples must lead environmental, climate, and political movements. Indigenous Peoples have an inherent connection to how to live in harmony and in reciprocity with the Earth, unlike the colonized mind that is taught to extract and commodify the resources we have been offered. In doing so they also called attention to the appalling racism and colonization that is still alive in America. The Dakota Access pipeline was originally proposed to go through Bismarck, a predominantly White community. After locals pushed back on the pipeline for fear that it would poison their water system, the pipeline was rerouted through tribal land without proper consultation with the Standing Rock Sioux Nation or their consent. In response to this injustice, the youth began a spirit camp on the land that would become known as Oceti Sakowin. Their courage and determination sparked a unified Indigenous-led movement that not only fulfilled ancient prophecies but also elevated and centered Indigenous issues that go beyond Dakota Access. After months of lawsuits and global mobilizations pressuring President Obama and the Army Corps of Engineers, it was announced that the project would undergo an environmental review. Under federal law, pipelines are eligible for a fast-tracked permitting process, which is how Dakota Access bypassed more rigorous environmental and public review. They plan to continue to use all legal avenues available even if oil starts flowing. People are withdrawing their individual accounts and more Divest Your City campaigns are popping up every day. While the ultimate fate of the legal challenges is unknown, with Trump in office, there is reason to believe that oil could soon flow through Dakota Access and under the Missouri River in a matter of months. Yet, despite what we are up against, because of what Standing Rock has taught us, I feel strong, and I know that our collective resistance, if sustained, will have a long term impact on stopping the fossil fuel industry. From the Trans-Pecos Pipeline in Texas to the Bayou Bridge Pipeline in the Gulf and up to the Line 3 and Line 5 Pipelines in the Great Lakes region, there are numerous places where we can continue to put pressure on the Fossil Fuel Industry and demand that Indigenous Rights and climate science be honored.

A professor at the University of Calgary was able to discover a safer way to transport petroleum, which has been a hazard to the environment for many years. Ian Gates, who works at the Schulich School of Engineering at the University of Calgary, was attempting to upgrade bitumen in the laboratory. Bitumen is a mixture of hydrocarbons left over after oil is distilled. Traditionally, this material is used to create hard surfaces like road blacktops. However, in the process they actually degraded it, creating a thick, gummy mixture. By doing this, petroleum could be captured as the mixture hardens. Gates and his team were able to form pebbles of oil that would harden by themselves. These balls of bitumen safely stored oil that could end up being shipped in its new form."

You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. The First Amendment is under attack along the Dakota Access pipeline route in North Dakota. Police and private security forces outfitted in riot gear and armed with assault weapons have unleashed dogs, pepper spray and rubber bullets on peaceful Native Americans and their allies. Overzealous law enforcement officials in North Dakota have jailed journalists and celebrities who were exercising their constitutionally protected right to free speech and the press by documenting police attacks on protesters. These actions are a serious affront to the Constitution and sovereign tribal rights and are an egregious abuse of power by the police and government in order to protect the fossil fuel industry. Tell North Dakota Gov. Jack Dalrymple and the U.S. Department of Justice: Stop police abuse and protect the Constitution, not the fossil fuel industry. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe and members of over 200 other tribes from across the Americas are leading the resistance to protect sovereign land and drinking water from destruction by the fossil fuel industry. However, in an attempt to quell these historic nonviolent protests, Gov. Dalrymple ordered a state of emergency that has militarized the police force, set up a highway roadblock and mobilized the National Guard to intimidate protesters. Her reporting went viral, with over 14 million people on Facebook and millions more through the mainstream media viewing her reporting. Tell North Dakota Gov.

By last year, the U.S. had built 12,000 miles of pipe since 2010. On Monday, TransCanada asked the U.S. State Department to suspend review of its controversial Alberta-to-Nebraska pipeline in the latest episode of a six-year drama that has seen as many as five environmental reviews, numerous legal challenges and a rejection in 2012 by President Barack Obama. The 487-mile southern leg of the project, dubbed the Gulf Coast project, between Cushing, Okla. and Texas refineries came on stream in 2014. While the northern leg of Keystone XL remains under review, the Lower 48s have seen new oil pipes crisscrossing the country. The U.S. midstream infrastructure is responding to a near-doubling of U.S. production over the past six years. The U.S. saw an 11.6 per cent increase in crude oil transport via pipelines in 2014, according to AOPL data. But as U.S. oil production eases in response to lower crude prices, the rapid build-up could see pipeline capacity exceed production in the Bakken in North Dakota and even the Permian basin straddling Texas and New Mexico, Ogunnaike estimates. Armed with shipping commitments despite low crude prices, key pipeline operators are proceeding with many projects to alleviate the bottlenecks, which could add as much as 8.7 million barrels per day by 2018, Reuters data shows. TransCanada has reported higher volumes on the Keystone Pipeline System in its third-quarter earnings, while Enbridge Inc. is also looking to expand its presence in the Gulf Coast. Much of the opposition in the U.S. has focused on crude rail terminals, especially in California and Oregon, which has led to delays on some rail projects. In many states, pipeline is viewed more favourably than the sight of crude-bearing rail cars barreling down town centres. But for many the fight against Keystone XL pipeline remains a high priority in a larger battle to combat climate change. All rights reserved.

We have been doing our best to rest in this interim period, as we wait to see what happens to our movement once president-elect Trump is sworn in. A group of indigenous youth are walking from Saskatchewan, Canada to raise awareness about the fight to protect our water and to join us. They were motivated by a devastating oil spill which sent almost 60,000 gallons into the North Saskatchewan River, near their community. you have a few extra dollars that you are looking to donate before the end of the year, consider sending it their way. They will be using it to secure food, shelter, and supplies for the walkers.

Every time we ask you to make one last call or donate just a few more dollars, you show up in droves. While in Big Sur we received spiritual teachings from Chief Arvol Looking Horse and made plans for how we want to continue our organizing going forward. We participated in rallies in Santa Monica and in Ojai, where we met with the Chumash people in Ojai. many of you know, this weekend we heard about one of the most brutal police attacks on water protectors yet. Troopers used rubber bullets, mace, concussion grenades and water cannons on protectors in the dark, in freezing weather.

We wish we could rest today to recover from the shock but pipeline construction continues. Our water and home are more at risk than ever, and we need your help. California is currently experiencing the worst drought in its history, and dealing with the harmful effects drilling and fracking have on its limited water supply. We will begin the trip in a training with Chief Arvol Looking Horse, then running from San Francisco on down the coast. have already secured a donated space, and several advocates who will be giving trainings to help the youth in our group continue to develop their organizing skills.

Recently a few of us traveled to Flagstaff, Arizona, to join our Hopi brother Riley Ortega who organized a relay run from Arizona to Standing Rock in solidarity with our movement. addition, some of us just finished leading a teach-in in Boston, and another group of us were in New York City, meeting with media and organizing to put pressure on Hillary Clinton to comment on the pipeline. There we organized a march that ended in a rally at her campaign headquarters, where we set up a tipi in the lobby and called on her to commit to stopping this project if elected president.

Saturday, hundreds of people gathered at camp before dawn to walk 8 miles to a site where several water protectors had chained themselves to construction equipment. Some of us were present at this peaceful and prayerful action, walking over the burial grounds of our ancestors. But along the way, we were stopped by a line of military trucks and police officers who used pepper spray and batons to stop us. They body-slammed people to the ground, and arrested elders, journalists, and even a 17-year-old pregnant woman. In fact, just last week police in Washington state shot and killed Renee Davis, 5 months pregnant and mother of three.

On Standing Rock, like many other reservations, there is a severe lack of opportunities and resources for Native youth to grow and learn in a safe environment. Because of this, many young people struggle with addiction, and suicide is an all too common occurrence. you so much for your continued generosity. In a world where indigenous youth often feel like no one cares, this campaign has introduced us to a community of supporters who care deeply about protecting our earth and all those who live on it.

In the past few weeks since the announcement, they have been taking advantage of a lull in media coverage to increase their presence and continue criminalizing us for fighting to protect the water. Last week, 21 people from the camps were arrested while conducting a peaceful ceremony in which they planted corn and willow in the path of the pipeline. Police officers showed up with armored vehicles, in riot gear, and one of them even pointed a gun at the protectors before arresting them. be back soon with further actions you can take to help escalate the campaign.

In addition, they are asking for tribal consultation in re-evaluating how huge projects get fast-tracked the way the Dakota Access was, and deciding whether new legislation should be introduced to ensure that tribes are included in these decision-making processes moving forward. We are thrilled, and know that this would never have happened without the support of our allies from across the country and around the world.

Friday, after protesting in front of the Army Corps Headquarters, we had a meeting with several officials from the Army Corps, the Department of Defense, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. We delivered your signatures to them, and told them about why we are fighting to protect our communities from this pipeline. We talked about addiction and lack of opportunity on the reservation, and by the end of the meeting almost everyone was crying. It was an emotional moment, and we were so glad to be truly heard. For hours, we prayed, sang, and danced in the hot sun, calling on President Obama to come out and speak with us. When it started raining, we danced harder, and we sang louder. Sunday morning we left DC and drove to New York City to rally in Union Square. Shailene helped us put out the call, and Rosario Dawson joined us to speak about why she too opposes harmful oil pipelines. We ran around the park and through the streets, and our supporters ran behind us, helping to amplify our call. we are beginning our journey back to North Dakota to join our brothers and sisters at the Sacred Stone camp and await news on the legal battle our tribe has started against the pipeline. Today, we rest. Tomorrow, we keep fighting.

The Standing Rock Reservation has very few resources for young people, and those that do exist are constantly shutting down for lack of funding. We have no teen center and few job or educational opportunities. Our people are dying of drug abuse and alcoholism. shared this with the president when he met with myself and a small group of young people from our tribe in 2014. It was an emotional meeting for all involved. We told him stories about our struggles on the reservation, and he cried with us when one of my friends talked about having to leave college in order to come home and care for his siblings after his mother became addicted to meth. As we move farther east the air is getting more humid, and we are moving through time changes. Back home in North Dakota, our allies are continuing their efforts to stop the pipeline by camping on the lawn of the state capitol.

Yesterday we found out that in spite of months of campaigning, the Army Corps of Engineers has ignored our calls to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline. They have granted a construction permit for the project. The Dakota Access Pipeline is a direct threat to the health and safety of those living along the pipeline route, yet our tribe was never consulted in talks leading up to the permit. Not only that, but the project relied on an environmental assessment that did not take tribal concerns into consideration at all. This means that we need to ramp up our efforts even more and increase pressure on them to do the right thing. But before then, we need your to help. The pipeline threatens the health and safety of all those living along its path, particularly the members of the Standing Rock Tribe, whose drinking water will be at risk. Though we are devastated by this news, we are NOT giving up. Please help us stay strong and stop this awful pipeline.

It was quite amazing. So, he knows the Standing Rock tribe in North Dakota. SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I trust that most people here know about the Dakota Access pipeline. And I think your description of the situation is correct. So those are the three issues there. I think what we have done is, number one, demanded that the president do what he did with Keystone. A lot of people put a lot of pressure on the president, and he finally did the right thing. And that is to kill the Keystone pipeline, which, by the way, under a Trump may be reopened again. But that is what he should be doing. And certainly, the demand must go to the North Dakota authorities that the kind of military presence that exists there is simply not what is acceptable. So, we have written to the president. We are going to continue to put pressure on the president to do everything he can to protect the Native Americans in the area and the protesters in the area.

The Dakota Access pipeline, which is largely finished, would carry as many as 570,000 barrels a day of shale oil 1,170 miles from western North Dakota to pipeline connections in Illinois. Hicks said she did not know why Trump sold his shares in Energy Transfer, whose stock sagged as protests intensified during the fall.

        "Sentences": "Trump also signed an executive order aimed at advancing construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline, the source of months of protests at an encampment on the territory of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota. In what many called a victory, the Army Corps of Engineers underneath President Barack Obama denied the Dakota Access Pipeline an easement in December, delaying construction until a full environmental impact assessment could be completed. For Trump to bypass that, he would need to pass a bill in Congress excluding the pipeline from the National Environmental Protection Act. The encampment at Standing Rock, which sits directly in the path of the intended Dakota Access route, has swelled exponentially, as Indigenous and non-Indigenous protesters arrived to oppose the pipeline over concerns of land sovereignty and water safety. Read more Donald Trump signed two executive orders Tuesday, each advancing a controversial oil pipeline promised to boost the North American oil industry but also fuel battles with opponents to oil development. Trump also signed an executive order aimed at advancing construction on the Dakota Access Pipeline, the source of months of protests at an encampment on the territory of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in North Dakota. In what many called a victory, the Army Corps of Engineers underneath President Barack Obama denied the Dakota Access Pipeline an easement in December, delaying construction until a full environmental impact assessment could be completed. For Trump to bypass that, he would need to pass a bill in Congress excluding the pipeline from the National Environmental Protection Act. The encampment at Standing Rock, which sits directly in the path of the intended Dakota Access route, has swelled exponentially, as Indigenous and non-Indigenous protesters arrived to oppose the pipeline over concerns of land sovereignty and water safety. Asked directly on Tuesday about the protesters, Trump refused to answer. Given the low price of oil, and the possibility of a cross-border tax that has been lauded by both the Trump White House and the House Republican leadership, such a cut seems unlikely. Proponents have touted both lines for their potential to boost jobs in high-unemployment areas of the Midwest and to provide a shot in the arm for the flagging Canadian oil industry, beset by low oil prices. Stock prices for both TransCanada and Energy Transfer Partners jumped as the news broke.

        "Sentences": "That jump was largely driven by a massive increase in solar panel installations, according to a report released Tuesday by the non-profit solar advocacy group The Solar Foundation. The rise in installations was caused by a rapid decrease in the cost of solar panels and unprecedented consumer demand, according to Andrea Luecke, president and executive director of The Solar Foundation. The National Solar Jobs Census 2016, the seventh annual report on solar employment issued by the foundation, says installed solar capacity is projected to grow a record 14 gigawatts in 2016, almost double the 7.5 GW growth experienced in 2015. With such a gain, solar will likely exceed all other sources of new electric generating capacity for the year, according to the report. The solar jobs census follows a U.S. Department of Energy study released last month that found more Americans work in solar than at natural gas or coal power plants. The DOE report says 187,117 workers are employed at coal, oil, and natural gas power plants compared to nearly 374,000 people in the solar industry. The latest solar job numbers are significant. Still, the National Solar Jobs Census 2016 documents the dramatic growth of an industry in less than a decade. However, the growth in residential and commercial capacity deployment may offset utility-scale job losses, according to the report. A few more highlights: One out of every 50 new U.S. jobs was in the solar industry. Solar industry employment growth outpaced that of the overall U.S. economy by 17 times as it increased by over 51,000 jobs, for a total of 260,077 U.S. solar workers. The number of solar jobs increased in 44 of the 50 states in 2016. California employs the most solar workers, followed by Massachusetts, Texas, Nevada, and Florida. Workers who install rooftop solar panels make up the largest share employment in the sector at 137,133 jobs. SolarCity, which merged with Tesla (tsla) in 2016, Vivint Solar, and Sunrun (run) are the biggest residential installers. Manufacturing is a distant second with 38,121 jobs, followed by 34,400 in project development, and 32,147 in sales and distribution.

        "Sentences": "Energy Transfer Partners wants the pipeline as the end of the Dakota Access pipeline, to bring North Dakota crude to Gulf coast refineries and export terminals. Transcript DOERING: From PRI, and the Jennifer and Ted Stanley Studios at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, this is Living on Earth. But it also lies along the route that would bring oil drilled in North Dakota to export terminals on the Gulf of Mexico. DOERING: Since the Trump Administration gave the green light to the controversial Dakota Access Pipeline, Energy Transfer Partners has been working hard to get the Bayou Bridge pipeline across the Atchafalaya built. But a federal judge in Louisiana recently ordered a temporary stop to the pipeline construction, following a court challenge by several environmental groups. KAISER: Here to tell us more is Anne Rolfes, the founding director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. Thanks for having me. ROLFES: Well, the judge agreed that there is a risk to the Atchafalaya Basin that is serious enough to warrant Energy Transfer Partners halting construction of this pipeline. She agreed with the plaintiffs that this pipeline could do irreparable harm. KAISER: So, I mean I do understand that the Army Corps of Engineers gave the Bayou Bridge pipeline its seal of approval some months ago. Now, the judge has ordered this temporary stop because of environmental concerns. An eighteenth-century map of the Atchafalaya Basin. (Photo: Stuart Rankin, Flickr CC BY-NC 2.0) ROLFES: What should have happened from the beginning is that the Army Corps of Engineers should have conducted an Environmental Impact Statement, to really assess what the impacts are along the route. You have drinking water threatened in one area, you have black bear habitat threatened in the basin. You have a community, a historic African-American community, threatened in the community of St. James Louisiana. And the Army Corps of Engineers by refusing to conduct an Environmental Impact Statement didn't acknowledge that. KAISER: So, I understand that as well as some environmental groups, local fishermen are concerned about the construction of the pipeline. Tell me more about that. ROLFES: It's a really wonderful assortment of opposition. You have people in the western part of the state, in Calcasieu Parish, who are concerned about the impacts on their land. I mean, these are ordinary people who happen to own land along the pipeline route, and Energy Partners has seized that land and the people have no power to stop them. You continue down the route and you have indigenous communities that are concerned about the impacts to drinking water, and then if you continue you hit the Atchafalaya Basin where the crawfishermen make their living from the basin. There are wild crawfish there still, and the problem with a pipeline like the Bayou Bridge pipeline is that it acts as a dam and restricts water flow. The water dies, essentially, and then all of the living creatures within that water also die, and so in our case the pipeline restricts water flow, and the crawfish die. And if you're not from Louisiana you might not understand how significant crawfish are to us, but culturally they are a lynchpin for us and at this time of year, the spring is the time of year where we eat crawfish. KAISER: I am one of those people who has never been to the Atchafalaya Basin. I imagine a lot of our listeners have never been there. ROLFES: Yeah, one of the crawfishermen has described the basin as his Yellowstone, and if you think about the magnitude of the national parks that people might be more familiar with, Yellowstone or Glacier or the Smokies to the east, it's that magnitude of natural significance. And so what you see is, you see placid water, flat water, brown, maybe dark green water and you see these beautiful cypress trees and moss hanging down from them, you'll see alligators swimming around. Once night falls you'll start to see frog eyes if you shine a light. So, it's teeming with life. KAISER: So, the pipeline would run through 162 miles of the state, part of it would be sitting right in the water. ROLFES: What we see the impacts of oil spills to be, and we know because we see them all the time, is that they kill the wildlife and they kill the natural world. So, for example, we're having these water protector trainings, and I was speaking with a crawfisherman at one of those trainings and he said he can already see from past oil skills that our red fish population has gone down in areas and that our crabs have also died off. And so this has been a long assault on the state of Louisiana by the oil industry. KAISER: So, the pipeline is being sold as providing jobs and energy independence to the state. So, the fact that our governor and our elected officials are peddling this pipeline is laughable because they're not even hiring people from our state. And then energy independence, I mean, that's hot air also because certainly some of this oil will be for export. Anne Rolfes is the Founding Director of the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. ROLFES: Yeah, let me just say this because I don't want people to get...before I answer that, I don't want people to get depressed about this fight because it is a great moment in Louisiana. Just yesterday we were out on the pipeline route, we stood in front of backhoes, we stopped their construction. We prevented that backhoe from grabbing a pipe that they were trying to grab and from laying in the ground. So, there is a lively resistance here where you have people who are willing to take action, 50 of us as happened yesterday stood in the way of a backhoe. That hasn't happened here before, and the oil industry ought to be scared, they ought to realize that it's a different day, and that they will have trouble on their hands. And the next steps are, of course, that Bayou Bridge has furiously filed motions to vacate the judge's ruling, and so it's just a matter of waiting, and you know waiting for decisions. KAISER: Anne Rolfes is a Founding Director of the environmental group, the Louisiana Bucket Brigade. Ann, thank you so much for coming on the program today. ROLFES: Oh, my pleasure, I'm glad to be here. We intend to seek immediate relief from this decision in the appropriate courts. Beyond that, we will decline to comment on the legal process, but instead defer to our filings. It is important to clarify that construction of this important infrastructure project continues in all other areas along the route.

The standoff to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a fever pitch, and this may be our last chance to halt construction before Donald Trump takes office. Militarized law enforcement and private security firms are harassing, assaulting and jailing hundreds of non-violent protesters who are fighting for indigenous rights and to curb climate change. They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do. Ibid."

        "Sentences": "CANNON BALL, N.D. (Reuters) - More than 2,000 U.S. military veterans plan to form a human shield to protect protesters of a pipeline project near a Native American reservation in North Dakota, organizers said, just ahead of a federal deadline for activists to leave the camp they have been occupying. Protesters include various Native American tribes as well as environmentalists and even actors including Shailene Woodley. State officials issued an order on Monday for activists to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, located on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers land near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, citing harsh weather conditions. The state's latest decision not to stop cars entering the protest site indicated local officials will not actively enforce Monday's emergency order to evacuate the camp issued by Governor Jack Dalrymple. The 1,172-mile (1,885 km) pipeline project, owned by Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners LP , is mostly complete, except for a segment planned to run under Lake Oahe, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Missouri River. Veterans Stand for Standing Rock, a contingent of more than 2,000 U.S. military veterans, intends to go to North Dakota by this weekend and form a human wall in front of police, protest organizers said on a Facebook page. Organizers could not immediately be reached for comment. Dull Knife, a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe from the Pine Ridge Reservation of South Dakota, said he has been camping at the protest site for months. Morton County Sheriff's Office spokesman Rob Keller said in an email his agency was aware of the veterans' plans, but would not comment further on how law enforcement will deal with demonstrators. Former U.S. Marine Michael A. Wood Jr is leading the effort along with Wesley Clark Jr, a writer whose father is retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark. U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, a Democrat from Hawaii and a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard, has said on Twitter she will join the protesters on Sunday. The Army Corps, citing safety concerns, has ordered the evacuation of the primary protest camp by Dec. 5, but said it would not forcibly remove people from the land. Local law enforcement said on Tuesday they planned a blockade of the camp, but local and state officials later retreated, saying they would only check vehicles for certain prohibited supplies like propane, and possibly issue fines. Dalrymple on Wednesday said state officials never contemplated forcibly removing protesters and there had been no plans to block food or other supplies from the camp. He also warned protesters that while emergency responders will try to reach anyone in need, that would be contingent on weather conditions. That decision has been delayed twice by the Army Corps.

        "Sentences": "Rather than retreat amidst the cold and an order from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to vacate by Monday, the Oceti Sakowin camp, the epicenter of pipeline opposition, is growing in size - and quickly winterizing in expectation of harsher weather. Dozens of insulated tipis have popped up in recent weeks, adding to those that have dotted these barren plains since last summer. Yurts, a round tent popular in the cold tundra of East Asia, have started appearing. Portable toilets are being swapped out for heated, composting commodes. Ice cleats, which strap onto boots to give stability on ice, are now in demand. Taylor Orpin, 23, quit her job to move to the camp last month. Thousands of people, led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, are protesting the pipeline, which would carry crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois en route to the Gulf of Mexico. A division of labor keeps many active, with campers volunteering in the four kitchens, shoveling snow, building tents and doing myriad other tasks. The multitudes at the camp defy the predictions of state and local officials, many of whom said out-of-state protesters would flee south like migrating birds. Children can be seen sliding playfully down nearby hills while senior citizens gossip over fire pits. North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple issued an evacuation order for the camp earlier this week, citing the weather. The protests started attracting more attention in the late summer, particularly after clashes between activists and private security hired by Energy Transfer Partners (ETP.N), which is building the line. The Obama Administration has twice delayed approval for ETP to tunnel the pipeline under the Missouri River. This one-mile stretch is the last unfinished spot on the line in North Dakota. The Three Affiliated Tribes of the MHA Nation, another large American Indian tribe in North Dakota, earlier this fall funded portable toilets, food and garbage removal. Even though they have earned billions from the extraction of oil and gas from their lands, the MHA have supported the Standing Rock protest. U.S. postal locations in nearby Bismarck and Fort Yates have been engulfed with donated packages. Three UPS (UPS.N) delivery locations in Bismarck have processed more than 5,000 packages in recent weeks. A UPS spokesman said the number well exceeds what is usual for the area. Beyond donations, Hollywood actors like Shailene Woodley and Susan Sarandon have visited North Dakota, though they are not currently at the camp. Some campers bring technical skills. Joshua Tree, 42, has helped install solar panels and wind turbines to power a white, dome-like structure that dwarfs everything else here. The dome, which organizers say can hold 380 people, is where most meetings and press events are held. As the group tries to ward off the cold, challenges loom. One family had to be hospitalized on Thursday due to carbon monoxide poisoning after attempting to heat a tent using propane without proper ventilation. Signs posted around the camp note there are 18 different communal sleeping areas that are warmer than personal tents.

It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community.

This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

We are veterans of the United States Armed Forces, including the U.S. Army, United States Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard and we are calling for our fellow veterans to assemble as a peaceful, unarmed militia at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation on Dec 4-7 and defend the water protectors from assault and intimidation at the hands of the militarized police force and DAPL security. 2K EVENT CAPACITY ACHIEVED: Event capacity based on accommodations, travel logistics and supplies; given the time we have to coordinate, resources available and the shipping and weather conditions in the region has been set at 2,000 rostered participants. We currently have over 2,100 Veterans on the roster. Our goal now is to prioritize this list to Veterans and Civilian personnel involved with operations, planning & onsite execution. next mission could be as early as the 2nd week of December. More to come The funds we raise on this page will go towards providing transportation and supplies for the brave patriots that come and stand with us. We have full support of the Sioux tribe elders and will be cooperating with them every step of the way. Several had to be treated for hypothermia and one protestor who was hit directly with a grenade has reportedly had her arm amputated as a result. Everyday becomes more evident that the defenders of America must stand with the Water Protectors. Let's stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home. Not if you allow this the be the United States. Please donate and pass this page along to your friends, family, coworkers and community members. It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement. This has been a life-changing experience for everybody involved and we plan to keep fighting for you as long as we have to. Please try again. I have 5 more seats in my Grand Caravan.

        "Sentences": "All rights reserved. For months, opponents of the Dakota Access Pipeline have been expressing fears that it would affect local drinking water, because it was to be built under the Missouri River near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation - the primary water source of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. Last week, the US Department of the Army announced that it would not approve the crossing of the pipeline under the Missouri River. And while local drinking water will not be affected, at least two cows have been confirmed dead in the area, but a definitive connection between their deaths and the oil spill has not been made. Perhaps even more concerning than a freak accident splitting the pipe is the fact that electronic monitoring equipment failed to detect the leak - something that would have prevented the pipe from spilling so much oil out into the countryside. While there's no guarantee that a leak like this would happen at the Dakota Access Pipeline, this kind of thing is not exactly rare in the area. Belle Fourche Pipeline Co. has reported 10 oil spills since 2011. So while none of that means the Dakota Access Pipeline is necessarily a risk, the Billings County leak is making the protesters' point for them: it's clear we need to do a better job at ensuring the structural integrity of those pipes. 5 days ago Politics & Society Semi-Automatic Rifles Really Are More Deadly, New Study Clearly Shows Numbers don't lie. 6 days ago Politics & Society To Save Ourselves It's Time to Rethink Our Economic System, Warn Scientists The market is killing the planet. 3 hours ago HEALTH These Simple Tips For Storing Fruits And Vegetables Will Help You Keep Them Fresh Longer You might be doing it wrong. 4 hours ago NATURE Terrifying 'Rafts' of Stinging Fire Ants Are Now Floating Around After Hurricane Florence Locals are being warned to avoid them at all costs.

        "Sentences": "Tseleil-Waututh tribal member Ed Thomas, left and Rueben George on a skiff in Burrard Inlet next to the Kinder Morgan tank farm talking about oil spills and increased tanker traffic if the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion is built. Expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline in Canada, which would triple the amount of oil transported from the Alberta tar-sands fields to a Vancouver-area port, faces opposition on both sides of the border, and multiple lawsuits. Spur line connects to Washington refineries. Source: Kinder Morgan Inc. Approval is not a slam dunk, said Gurpal Dosanjh, a refining analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence in New York. About the DAPL protest The Trump administration has advanced the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipeline projects. And here's what we're reading related to the controversy. March 28: What the completed Dakota Access pipeline means for key players. Feb. 22: Preparing to leave, Standing Rock protesters ceremonially burn camp. Feb. 1: Hundreds rally as the Seattle City Council considers divesting from Wells Fargo because of its role as a Dakota Access Pipeline lender. The Standing Rock Sioux tribe says it will push back. Even it if is approved, Kinder Morgan could have a long slog ahead. The project is opposed by the mayors of Vancouver, Victoria and Burnaby, as well as many First Nations, and already faces multiple lawsuits. Major environmental groups, including Greenpeace Canada, Sierra Club BC and Raincoast Conservation, also oppose the project. The company notes that pipelines are safer and cheaper than shipping oil by rail. In Canada, the pipeline has the support of the federal government. That has Canada all the hungrier to move oil to other export markets on the Pacific Rim, Klassen said. Concerns about spills and stoking global warming by increased use of fossil fuels have native nations and environmental groups on both sides of the border fighting the project. They are drafting momentum from the recent defeat by Washington tribes of a major coal-export terminal at Cherry Point, and the fierce resistance led by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe in North Dakota that has bedeviled the Dakota Access oil pipeline. Cam Fenton, Canada communications Manager for 350.org, an environmental group focused on climate change, says his organization is preparing for large-scale mass civil disobedience. In Longview, Millennium Bulk Terminals has proposed the largest coal-export facility anywhere in North America. In Vancouver, Tesoro-Savage has proposed an oil-by-rail transfer facility with the capacity to move an average of 360,000 barrels of oil every day. The Westway oil-by-rail expansion in Grays Harbor, home to key bird habitat on the Pacific flyway, and a treaty-protected tribal fisheries, is opposed by environmentalists and the Quinault Indian Nation. Oil to both the Tesoro-Savage and the Westway terminals would be transported in rail cars, which have been involved in accidents and spills, most recently in Mosier, Ore. Kinder Morgan wants to begin construction on Trans Mountain in 2017 and finish by 2019. We have committed shippers with long-term contracts for 15 to 20 years for space on that pipeline. Visitors to Cates Park look across Burrard Inlet to the Kinder Morgan tank farm. Cates Park was once a summer village site of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation. There have been 82 reported spills since 1961 at pump stations and terminals along the pipeline. The diluted bitumen and other products that would be shipped in the expansion is the same as Kinder Morgan ships from its pipeline today, and would be shipped in the same Aframax tankers that take delivery from the existing pipeline. Beyond the soft handshake and diplomatic demeanor of tribal elders in the homeland of the Tsleil-Waututh Nation, where the pipeline terminates in the east end of the Burrard Inlet in North Vancouver, B.C., lies a steely resistance. Amy George, in her 70s, helped lead a demonstration of thousands in Vancouver last week against the expansion. What unites this tribal nation with tribes and communities across the border in Washington is concern for the shared ecosystem. Tsleil-Waututh hereditary Chief Sla-holt (Ernest George Sr.), 76, thinks the Burrard Inlet in North Vancouver, B.C., has already seen too much industrial development. Under the Trans Mountain project, the dock would be expanded from one berth to three. The number of tanks holding the oil would more than double, and those would hold more than triple the amount of oil. Impacts from the expansion would be experienced far beyond the inlet. The project would bring an additional 350 tankers carrying oil a year to the Salish Sea, marine waters shared by British Columbia and Washington state. Spills could be damaging either from fuel-oil transfers to tankers, or from the diluted bitumen the tankers carry, the department warned in a September 2016, letter to the Canadian government. The Salish Sea is particularly vulnerable to a big uptick in tanker traffic because of its swift currents, sharp turns required for big ships and rich marine resources. The assessment by the Tsleil-Waututh Nation found their people would bear the brunt of the impacts at the end of the pipeline. Hereditary Chief Sla-holt (Ernest George Sr.), 76, reminds a visitor his people have been here some 13,000 years, or, as they say here, since time out of mind. He and his neighbors think this stretch of water has already seen too much industrial development. Ed Thomas, 64, says efforts to clean up the inlet have just recently enabled the band to hold its first clam harvest in 30 years. Elk are coming back to the woods. So are cougar and bear, and the salmon in nearby Indian Creek. View Comments No personal attacks or insults, no hate speech, no profanity.

        "Sentences": "Momrade. Community organizer for harm reduction and DSA. MSU student at Tulane University. Know better, do better. Slithering across the northern plains of America is the Dakota Access Pipeline, now 70 percent complete. The pipeline will transport hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude oil from the Bakken oil fields of North Dakota more than 1,100 miles to an oil tank farm in Illinois. Clean drinking water for 18 million people, sacred native lands stolen by the U.S. government and subsequently privatized, and a centuries-old and still-perpetuated practice of environmental racism and aggression against indigenous people in America. A handful of billionaires. Our land was taken, our language was forbidden. Our stories, our history, were almost forgotten. Sites of cultural and historic significance are important to us because they are a spiritual connection to our ancestors. Even if we do not have access to all such sites, their existence perpetuates the connection. Within the tribes, natives experience the highest rate of poverty of any racial group in the country. The land slated for construction of the pipeline was given to the Sioux in the Treaty of Fort Laramie in the mid-1800s. In the coerced treaty, the tribe conceded much of their land, making it available for the eventual private appropriation for construction of the pipeline. In the 1940s, Lewis A. Pick of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intentionally flooded hundreds of thousands of acres of tribal lands with a series of dams in a public works project along the Missouri River. When 200,000 acres of land in the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River Nations were flooded by the Pick-Sloan Plan from the Oahe Dam, socioeconomic and cultural life for the Sioux suffered permanent consequences. Living members of tribes today experienced this intentional act of aggression from the vintage Corps. Archaeological evidence suggests the Missouri River has been sustaining human life for more than 10,000 years. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued permits for more than 200 water crossings for the Dakota Access Pipeline, including two crossings of the Missouri River, one of Little Missouri, and one under Lake Oahe near the Standing Rock reservation. Warren Between 2009 and 2015, the number of pipeline spills and leaks rose by almost 60 percent, a number which the Associated Press reported roughly matched the rise in U.S. crude oil production. The Dakota Access Pipeline is approximately 70 percent complete and is estimated to carry between 470,000 and 570,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois. The Dallas Morning News reported the daily oil capacity of the DAPL is equal to 6 percent of total current U.S. domestic crude oil production. As capacity increases, so do the risks of deadly spills. Not so here. Domestic oil pipelines, unlike natural-gas pipelines, require no general approval from the federal government. Further investment in pipelines with no federal oversight coupled with the knack of corporations to reduce costs of construction and maintenance in the never-enough quest for profits is setting the poorest communities in America up for future disaster and further dispossession. In addition to his 23,000 square-foot mansion in Preston Hollow, Warren also owns ranches in Austin, Colorado, and east Texas, as well as a private island off the coast of Honduras. Less competition can mean higher prices and result in larger, powerful, and autocratic institutions, but potentially fewer superfluous pipeline paths that result from private ownership conflicts. I do not play for companies who defile nature, or companies who attack demonstrators with trained attack dogs and pepper spray. On Sunday, November 27, Browne and artist Bonnie Raitt played a benefit concert for protesters fighting the pipeline. While investment in infrastructure may alleviate immediate shortages and stopgap job creation, the short-term approaches of oil transfer and refinement leave people at risk for generations to come. After all, it is primarily older pipelines that burst and cause great damage. A pipeline built in such close proximity to the sovereign soil of the Sioux may sound a reasonable sacrifice to someone with quarterly profits in mind, but not to people hoping to raise children and grandchildren on land they can neither sell nor trade. The semantics of sovereign soil complicate the options of natives to evacuate future disasters and permanent destruction of land they consider sacred. Long after Energy Transfer Partners falls and Kelcy Warren and his investors are in the ground, the Standing Rock Sioux will be on the land he considers potential collateral damage. These are our only remaining homelands. We have to protect them. Protesters were attempting to clear a blockade of two burnt military trucks on Highway 1806 blocking access to emergency services. More than 400 protesters have been arrested in Standing Rock, leading to multiple incidents of violence between the protesters, police, and the private security firm hired by Dakota Access. While hundreds of protesters have been arrested and charged with crimes, not one security contractor was charged with acts of assault against natives or activists. As insult to injury, protesters have faced humiliating strip searches for misdemeanor charges. The imbalance in arrests represents only the tip of an iceberg of injustice. Instead of waiting for the verdict from the court, Dakota Access dug up the sites anyway, prompting the Judge to issue a too-little-too-late order of protection to stop construction. In other words, Dakota Access was rewarded for disrespecting the jurisdiction of the court and, as result, the law does not apply to the protection of those lands anymore as there is no longer anything to protect. Across the country, many thousands more have gathered in solidarity. For years, Gallup has shown more than 75 percent of Americans want more investment in renewable energy and fewer than 40 percent want continued investment in fossil fuels. Warren and his company Energy Transfer Partners are not simply ignoring the desires of activists and natives in defense of clean drinking water, but also that of most Americans. Bloomberg reported ETP scrapped plans for a new gas pipeline in Michigan after facing opposition from environmentalists. This time, however, Warren and ETP appear to be doubling down on the pipeline. As a publicly-traded company, one could even argue Dakota Access is living up to the legal mandate to provide profit for shareholders above all other factors. She was asked to leave the building by security and a formal complaint was lodged with Dallas Police Department. Bluehorse has high hopes for a change of heart and has petitioned him on the grounds of humanity. In the case of the Dakota Access pipeline, rivals appear to include not only competitors within Big Oil, but also protesters, journalists, and natives. One female filmmaker is facing a 45-year sentence for covering events at the camp. Many more journalists have been tased, attacked, and arrested. Arrest warrants were also issued for Green Party presidential and VP candidates Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka. A 25-year-old female activist and candidate for Congress was shot with a rubber bullet in the back at point-blank range at Sacred Stone camp while interviewing a protester on camera. When private security officials and Dakota Access construction workers sought extrajudicial crowd-control and vengeance, a pregnant woman and a child were victims to their acts of unlawful aggression. The profound lack of justice for Standing Rock was compounded when North Dakota Governor Jack Dalrymple declared a state of emergency and brought in the National Guard, armed with industrial pepper spray tanks, noise machines known to cause permanent hearing damage, tasers, and military vehicles. The influx of funding has increased the police presence; however, emergency services have failed to protect those exercising their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble. When a brush fire broke out near the Oceti Sakowin camp, Morton County Fire Department ignored the calls and sent no emergency vehicles. In late November, Governor Dalrymple ordered an emergency order of evacuation of thousands of protesters from the camp. As a result of the order, approximately 2,000 veterans joined protesters to offer protection and support under the banner: Veterans Stand for Standing Rock. The ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, the lead-laced blood of East Chicago children, and the Dakota Access Pipeline have elevated environmental racism to public consciousness within the last year. Now with the rise of centralized, autocratic corporations, that legacy continues under a new guise and with the implied consent of the federal government through deafening silence from the White House and relevant federal agencies. The pipeline has wavered between court-ordered delays and approvals and the destiny of the sacred lands and environmental safety of Standing Rock are unknown. Standing Rock Chair Dave Archambault II has requested President Obama take action to reroute the pipeline before the presidency changes hands. While Obama ordered a temporary halt on construction, later rescinded, he has been accused of remaining altogether too removed from the issue. While the words display interest in fair representation for native nations, the mistreatment of protesters has been enabled to continue with inaction. Kelcy Warren has built Energy Transfer Partners into a 71,000 mile network of pipelines across the country. It is a matter of mere inconvenience for Warren that his dream comes at the expense of thousands of living nightmares. Early in December, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers denied Dakota Access an easement it needs to complete the pipeline. Almost on cue, the Belle Fourche pipeline ruptured 150 miles from the Sacred Stone camp in early December, dumping more than 130,000 gallons of oil into the Ash Coulee Creek along with more than 46,000 gallons of oil on nearby lands.

Slithering across the northern plains of America is the Dakota Access Pipeline, now 70 percent complete. Our land was taken, our language was forbidden. Our stories, our history, were almost forgotten. What land, language, and identity remains is derived from our cultural and historic sites. . . . Sites of cultural and historic significance are important to us because they are a spiritual connection to our ancestors. Even if we do not have access to all such sites, their existence perpetuates the connection. land slated for construction of the pipeline was given to the Sioux in the Treaty of Fort Laramie in the mid-1800s. the 1940s, Lewis A. Pick of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers intentionally flooded hundreds of thousands of acres of tribal lands with a series of dams in a public works project along the Missouri River. The Dakota Access Pipeline is approximately 70 percent complete and is estimated to carry between 470,000 and 570,000 barrels of oil per day from North Dakota to Illinois. capacity increases, so do the risks of deadly spills. almost no federal oversight and limited permitting requirements, Dakota Access is constructing a pipeline just a few feet shorter than the highly controversial Keystone XL vetoed by the Obama administration due to environmental concerns. Not so here. Domestic oil pipelines, unlike natural-gas pipelines, require no general approval from the federal government. shaky confidence in pipeline safety is likely abstract from the pipeline-free, lavish Dallas neighborhood of Preston Hollow. success earned him a Governor-appointed spot on the board with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission. I do not play for companies who defile nature, or companies who attack demonstrators with trained attack dogs and pepper spray. investment in infrastructure may alleviate immediate shortages and stopgap job creation, the short-term approaches of oil transfer and refinement leave people at risk for generations to come. After all, it is primarily older pipelines that burst and cause great damage. A pipeline built in such close proximity to the sovereign soil of the Sioux may sound a reasonable sacrifice to someone with quarterly profits in mind, but not to people hoping to raise children and grandchildren on land they can neither sell nor trade. These are our only remaining homelands. We have to protect them. than 400 protesters have been arrested in Standing Rock, leading to multiple incidents of violence between the protesters, police, and the private security firm hired by Dakota Access. hundreds of protesters have been arrested and charged with crimes, not one security contractor was charged with acts of assault against natives or activists. imbalance in arrests represents only the tip of an iceberg of injustice. those sites, the die is cast.

The standoff to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a fever pitch, and this may be our last chance to halt construction before Donald Trump takes office. Militarized law enforcement and private security firms are harassing, assaulting and jailing hundreds of non-violent protesters who are fighting for indigenous rights and to curb climate change. They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do. Ibid."

        "Sentences": "The Capitol Hill condo where Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has stayed in Washington. The expansion, a project of Enbridge Inc., a Calgary-based energy company, would allow hundreds of thousands more barrels of oil a day to flow through this pipeline to the United States from Canadian oilsands. The fine was the second-largest in the history of the Clean Water Act, behind the penalty imposed after the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt Associated Press A spokesman for Williams & Jensen said that the lobbying firm did not intervene with the EPA or Pruitt on the Enbridge pipeline expansion either before or after Pruitt was living in the condo owned in part by Vicki Hart, the wife of J. Steven Hart, the chairman of the firm. Williams & Jensen, for example, was lobbying the EPA early last year, according to its disclosure reports, on behalf of both Oklahoma Gas and Electric, a major coal-burning utility, and Concho Resources, a Texas-based oil and gas drilling company. The work for Oklahoma Gas involved the effort to repeal or revise the landmark Obama-era rule that pushed states to move away from coal in favour of sources of electricity that produce fewer carbon emissions. An EPA calendar in March 2017 shows that Pruitt and his chief of staff were scheduled to meet with company executives at the request of a Williams & Jensen lobbyist. Brian Alford, a spokesman for Oklahoma Gas, said the company had received no favours from Pruitt. Pruitt has considered revisions in both regulatory areas. In the Enbridge case, the EPA was asked to evaluate the potential environmental effect of the pipeline expansion application, as well as the quality of a preliminary review of the project that the State Department had already conducted. When the pipeline opened in 2010, it was permitted to carry only as much as 500,000 barrels of oil a day. The expansion would allow it to move an additional 390,000 barrels through a key three-mile section near the Canadian border. The oil it carries comes from the Canadian oilsands, like the oil for the proposed extension of the Keystone XL pipeline. Extraction from oilsands has drawn opposition from environmentalists, given that the process requires more energy than traditional drilling. Pipelines, like this one, that cross an international border into the United States require a presidential permit, which is issued only after the State Department has conducted a detailed environmental review and has taken input from other federal agencies, including the EPA. Investigators later found that employees allowed the oil to continue to flow after wrongly assuming that the alarms sounding were caused by a harmless vapour bubble. Enbridge has argued it has learned from that accident and taken corrective measures to prevent it from happening again. The conclusion stands in contrast to a similar evaluation by the agency in 2013 of the Keystone XL pipeline project. With the signoff by the EPA and the State Department, Enbridge received the expansion permit it needed in October, five years after it first applied for permission. Additional pumping stations have already been built, meaning the pipeline expansion project is already completed, the company said. Discussions have already started on Capitol Hill about asking the EPA inspector general to expand his inquiry to include the condo deal. Late Monday, three House Democrats who serve on the committee with oversight of the EPA sent a letter to Pruitt asking a series of questions about the condo lease, which was first reported by ABC News.

        "Sentences": "By 8:45 a.m., the spilled crude oil flowed from Hall Canyon a half-mile down Prince Barranca Valley, about one mile inland from San Buenaventura State Beach. Early estimates put the spill at around 5,000 barrels, which was later adjusted down to 700. One barrel of oil contains 42 gallons, so nearly 30,000 gallons of crude may have been spilled. Fire officials and hazmat teams are on the scene of Ventura County oil spill. He said he called 911 after smelling and hearing the flowing crude, and then rode his motor scooter up the canyon to find oil gushing from an above-ground box. The leak prompted a swift hazmat response to contain the spill and prevent the oil from entering the Pacific Ocean. The responders included several local and state agencies, including the California Fish and Wildlife Office of Spill Prevention and Response, the Ventura and Oxnard County fire departments and the Coast Guard Marine Safety Detachment Santa Barbara. The pipeline is owned by Crimson Pipeline, a privately-owned midstream pipeline company that owns and operates approximately 1,500 miles of pipelines across California and the Gulf of Mexico. The oil itself is owned by Aera Energy, the largest onshore oil producer in Ventura County, which produces an average of 13,000 barrels per day. The exact cause of the leak is still unknown. He added that he air quality was being monitored as a precaution. Some of the oil entered the Pacific Ocean, forming into tar balls that were found 130 miles away at Manhattan Beach. Oil from the spill fills a natural depression, despoiling the natural beauty of Ventura County's landscape. He told AlterNet: We have to treat pipeline spills and failures for what they are: not accidents but part of the day to day operations of the oil and gas industry. But the real goal needs to be a transition away from the dirty fuels that pave the road to catastrophic climate change with disasters like these. David Braun, co-founder of Rootskeeper, spoke on behalf of Californians Against Fracking in a press statement: Firefighters racing to block thousands of gallons of oil from dumping into our beautiful ocean sounds like a scene from a Hollywood disaster movie, but these devastating images are the reality in California. There is no incentive for oil companies to properly maintain their sites and to stop spilling because federal and state regulations and regulator agencies are so weak and there are no penalties. That is more spillage than the Exxon Valdez. Onshore. In one year. At this point, we cannot even call these spills. Spills happen by accident. This is no accident, this is a permanent state of criminal negligence. The oil and gas industry is so sloppy, so irresponsible, so damaging that their behavior amounts to crimes against nature and against humanity. If terrorists despoiled this much water and land and resources in the U.S., it would be all over the news every day. Since the oil and gas industry owns the government, there's hardly ever even the most paltry fines and penalties. And spills are even worse in places like the Amazon, where devastating leakages happen all the time.

I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

The Tribe has worked in good faith every step of the way to develop technical and cultural information to help the Corps fully understand the consequences of permitting this pipeline. They took our hard work and threw it in the trash. The Tribe will be reviewing this decision closely, and determine how best to proceed in close consultation with our membership, staff, and advisors. Previous Updates: Dec. 4, 2017 Court Opinion on Conditions Today, Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, citing the recent Keystone oil spill in South Dakota, imposed several interim measures over the ongoing operation of the Dakota Access pipeline. The Court ordered three different measures, all of which were requested by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. First, the Court ordered the Corps and DAPL to work with the Tribes to complete oil spill response plans at Lake Oahe. Up to now, the Tribe has been kept in the dark about spill response planning and was not involved in the process of developing plans to address spills at Lake Oahe. The Tribe has to be involved in the selection of an auditor. Finally, DAPL must file regular reports on any incidents or repairs on the pipeline. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe sued the Corps in July 2016, arguing that the pipeline destroyed sacred sites and threatens the water quality of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation that sits downstream of the site where the pipeline crosses the Missouri River in North Dakota. From the very beginning of our lawsuit, what we have wanted is for the threat this pipeline poses to the people of Standing Rock Indian reservation to be acknowledged. In a 28-page opinion, the court weighed two factors to determine whether or not the pipeline should be shut down. The court answered that question in the affirmative. Second, it assessed the disruptive consequences if the pipeline were shut down. However, the court found that the first factor was sufficient to rule against shutting down the pipeline. In its legal briefs, the Tribe had asked that if the pipeline were not shut down, then the court should impose additional measures to reduce the risk of oil spills to protect the Tribe. Because the district court case remains live, and the remand process is underway, this is not an appealable decision at this time. The Tribe intends to focus on the remand process and has a technical team of experts assisting it in providing input. The Corps has invited the Tribe to provide input into the remand, and that process is currently underway. The Corps has stated that process should be complete by April of next year. When Energy Transfer Partners proposed a new 1,200-mile oil pipeline from the Bakken oil fields to the Midwest, it chose a route crossing the Missouri River just yards upstream from the Standing Rock Sioux reservation. Within days of his inauguration, however, Donald Trump ordered the permits granted. The Tribe filed a lawsuit to challenge this decision, but construction was completed while the case was proceeding. In June, just weeks after pipeline operations had begun, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled for the Tribe that the Army Corps had not complied with environmental review laws before issuing permits for the pipeline to cross the Missouri River. The court ordered separate briefing to assess whether the pipeline should be shut down while the remand process is going on. The decision on Oct. 11 addresses that question. Even Earlier Updates: Tribes Ask Court to Shut Down Pipeline The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, joined by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, filed an extensive legal brief on August 7, 2017, explaining why the pipeline must be shut down during the new environmental review process. The Tribes were supported by several amicus parties, including a group of Tribes and Tribal organizations, including the National Congress of American Indians, and a group of law professors and experts on the National Environmental Policy Act. Proposed amicus briefs were also filed by the North Dakota Petroleum Council and a coalition of industry groups. Additional resources: What the June 14 court ruling means and in-depth background on this litigation. In a 91-page decision, Judge James Boasberg ruled that the federal permits authorizing the pipeline to cross the Missouri River just upstream of the Standing Rock reservation, which were hastily issued by the Trump administration just days after the inauguration, violated the law in certain critical respects. Normally, when a federal agency violates the law by not looking at environmental risks well enough, the appropriate remedy is to invalidate the underlying permit. Without a permit, the pipeline cannot operate. Over the course of the summer, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe will be making our best arguments to the Court that the Judge should shut down the pipeline pending the completion of a lawful environmental review. Oil is expected to start flowing through the Dakota Access Pipeline today. The Judge still has the power to halt the pipeline. On behalf of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Earthjustice filed a motion for summary judgment on Feb. 14 on the major legal claims in the lawsuit filed against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to prevent the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline under Lake Oahe near tribal lands. All of the briefs in this case have now been filed. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is deeply concerned about the construction of the major crude-oil pipeline that passes through its ancestral lands. Our lawsuit raises three critical claims, and asks the court to throw out the federal approvals. These environmental reviews have been prepared for decisions as mundane as off-leash dog areas and allowing jet skis in parks. No one disputes that the Tribe has important Treaty rights that guarantee the integrity of its reservation. This means that the federal government and its agencies cannot take any federal action that harms the Standing Rock reservation or the water in the Missouri River on which the people of Standing Rock depend. The Obama administration made a carefully considered decision that these Treaty rights needed to be respected in connection with an oil pipeline immediately upstream of the reservation. The Trump administration ignored that advice, and acted as if the Tribe does not exist. And finally, there are limits on the extent to which one administration can reverse the decisions of its predecessor. While federal agencies can change their minds about matters of policy, the courts will set aside reversals that are not fully justified and explained. Additional details on the key merits of this case. Read an account from Earthjustice attorney Jan Hasselman on seeking the preliminary injunction, the Court's ruling on the request, and the remarkable announcement issued by the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Justice and Interior. See: Standing With Standing Rock. In the key documents section of this FAQ. From The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Setting The Record Straight. The Tribe participated fully in the NEPA process. The Tribe sought to protect its rights when no one else would. In December 2016, the Corps correctly found that those issues needed further consideration through an EIS process. On his second full day in office, the Trump administration overruled the Corps and ordered the permits to be granted. See full document. Timeline of Events: July 27, 2016 The Tribe files a lawsuit in federal district court in Washington, D.C., where it was assigned to U.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg. August 4, 2016 The Tribe asks the Court for a preliminary injunction since the pipeline is already under construction and would be finished before the case could be formally decided. August 24, 2016 Judge Boasberg holds a hearing on the motion in Washington, D.C. Over 500 people participated in an action outside the federal courthouse in support of the Tribe. The Judge indicated that he would rule in roughly two weeks. On Sept. 4, the Tribe files an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order to block the construction until a decision is reached on the injunction motion. Sept. 6, 2016 Judge Boasberg holds a hearing on the emergency motion for a temporary restraining order. The Judge issues a temporary restraining order for the pipeline corridor nearest the Missouri River but declines to halt construction on the portion of the pipeline route that had recently been identified as sacred tribal burial ground. Oct. 5, 2016 Oral arguments on the emergency motion for injunction are held at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A ruling was not issued, keeping the temporary halt to construction in place until the Court issues a decision. Both the appeal and the district court litigation will proceed, but the injunction covering work in the pipeline corridor has ceased. In the interim, the Army will not authorize constructing the Dakota Access Pipeline on Corps land bordering or under Lake Oahe. Oct. 20, 2016 The Army Corps conducts a site visit to the area bulldozed over Labor Day to determine whether Dakota Access violated federal law by knowingly damaging a tribal sacred site. Under federal law, if Dakota Access is found to have knowingly damaged a historic or cultural resource with the intent of sidestepping the National Historic Preservation Act, the Corps cannot issue the easement. No determination has been finalized. Oct. 24, 2016 As confrontations between Tribal water protectors and an increasingly militarized construction effort heat up, Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II calls on the Department of Justice to conduct an investigation into heavy-handed police tactics and violations of civil rights. Read the Tribe's full statement. And given the flawed process that has put our drinking water in jeopardy, we also urge the Administration to call for a full environmental impact study.

Nov. 15, 2016 Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline files a lawsuit charging the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers has no right to delay easement to pipeline construction. Nov. 25, 2016 Federal officials announce that a decision had been made to close access to the entire area north of the Cannonball River including the Standing Rock protest campsite at Oceti Sakowin. They said the decision was made because of public safety concerns and that a 'free speech zone' to the south of Cannonball River would be created. Anyone on the closed land after Dec. 5 could be charged with trespassing.

At the symbolic center in Standing Rock, protesters aiming to halt construction continue to clash with police.

        "Sentences": "The surge in donations has coincided with a wave of media attention the group has received over the past two days. In a short period of two days, the picture changed dramatically. But with the increased funds, Wood Jr. says, the group will be able to afford more equipment and supplies to aid them in their three-day mission, which will culminate in an attempt to break through the line of guards protecting the Dakota Access construction site. The Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which spans the border of North and South Dakota and is home to members of the Lakota and Dakota nations (known collectively as Sioux), has been the site of an increasingly tense standoff between law enforcement-backed security contractors and activists since July, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers approved a plan to build one of the final segments of the 1,170-mile Dakota Access Pipeline on land adjacent to the reservation, sparking a massive protest that has drawn activists from as far as Israel, Russia, and Japan. According to the Standing Rock Sioux, the planned route, which will cross beneath the Missouri River, will threaten their drinking water supply and destroy sacred sites and burial grounds located on land that the government stripped from the Sioux in the past. Veterans For Standing Rock is headed to the area at a time when the situation on the ground appears to be growing increasingly chaotic. On Nov. 20, a 10-hour standoff between demonstrators and the police resulted in 300 people injured, according to the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council. Previous claims of excessive police force recently prompted the United Nations to launch an investigation of potential human rights abuses. In addition to concussion grenades, security contractors and law enforcement have repelled activists, often numbering in the hundreds, with pepper-spray, fire hoses, batons, dogs, and rubber bullets. I am extremely happy to be stressed out right now, trying to make this as soon as possible. Of course, more boots on the ground means more opportunities for people to get hurt. So far, it appears that the most violent episodes of the standoff have occurred when the demonstrators confronted the guards in overwhelming numbers. Wood Jr. points out that the violent efforts by law enforcement to dislodge the protesters merely prove his point that they have abrogated their responsibility to protect and serve the public, acting instead on behalf of private corporate interests.

        "Sentences": "Witness what happened on Sunday in North Dakota, when law enforcement officers escalated their tactics against unarmed American Indians and allies who have waged months of protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline. They drenched protesters with water cannons on a frigid night, with temperatures in the 20s. According to protesters and news accounts, the officers also fired rubber bullets, pepper spray, concussion grenades and tear gas. The confrontation happened at Backwater Bridge, on a highway linking the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation and Bismarck, N.D. Burned-out trucks and a police barricade have made the bridge impassable. The violence erupted after some of the protesters tried to remove the truck carcasses on Sunday. The pipeline, all but built, is meant to ship crude oil from North Dakota to Illinois. Built almost entirely on private property, the pipeline crosses ancestral lands of the Standing Rock Sioux, passing less than a mile from the tribal reservation. Tribe members fear contamination of their drinking water and damage to sacred sites. They are trying to persuade the federal government to deny permits allowing the pipeline to cross the Missouri River near their reservation. The Army Corps of Engineers has called for more study and input from the tribe before it decides on whether to grant a permit. The pipeline company has asked a federal judge to give it the right to proceed with its plan to lay pipe under the river. There is no firm timeline for either decision.

Passed by the UN in 2007, UNDRIP is the most comprehensive document in the world when it comes to Indigenous cultural rights, nationhood and self-determination. In 46 comprehensive legal articles, the document basically means Indigenous peoples can and should live as Indigenous peoples. You read that right. UNDRIP means Indigenous peoples have legal rights to maintain cultures, identities and communities, and nothing should stand in their way. For Canada, UNDRIP is a game-changer. Adopting it, to begin with, means no more Indian Act. No more draconian financial and legal control of Indigenous communities by a stifling Indigenous and Northern Affairs Department. Indigenous languages legally recognized as founding languages in Canada. Viable Indigenous economies. Healthy Indigenous bodies. Success. UNDRIP covers it all. Canada would be legally responsible to focus on these areas comprehensively. Unsurprisingly, UNDRIP spends a great deal of time talking about land. Approximately one-third of the document describes about how Indigenous communities must have access to traditional territories and suitable land to live healthy and productive lives. I know, UNDRIP is a tall order. Then, it was completely shelved. But this has never dissuaded Saganash. A residential school survivor who helped craft UNDRIP in the early 2000s, Saganash proposed his bill in 2016 and spent more than two years insisting that Canada fully commit to the document. He called it his career goal. The vote was 206-79. It was met with cheers and a standing ovation. That is, except for the 79 Conservative MPs who voted against it. Two of them, one from Alberta and one from Saskatchewan, even high-fived when voting against. Now, I understand politics. They are desires without the weight of delivery. We are a plaything. A toy. Something to entertain. Something Canada uses for things such as an Olympic logo. Then, the game is over. An investment, even. When it comes to selfies or ornaments or crying, governments love Indigenous peoples. Canada needs more people like Romeo Saganash, people who believe in change. Because right now Canada is a game. One that Indigenous peoples are losing. Just look at the high-fives. Reconciliation is here. Niigaan Sinclair Columnist Niigaan Sinclair is Anishinaabe and is a columnist at the Winnipeg Free Press.

Building great dangerous leaky pipelines to pump poison over water supplies, and to torment and abuse the people most affected by them, is not. The pipeline was ignoring all the environmental laws and the treaties; the state government was violating human rights. Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 4 December 2016 at 6:23 pm Sounds to me like the Army Corps of Engineers finally got off their duffs and looked at what they were supposed to do in the first place. Anything less than double-walled construction where a spill would endanger the water supply for even one person is caving in to the industry with a bad reputation. Make them truly respect the concept that failure is not an option. No bankruptcy will stop the liens on their personal liability for their decisions.

You got it. Hypocrisy knows no bounds. jrkrideau says 4 December 2016 at 7:38 pm Congratulations to all those people defending the land at Standing Rock. Regulations, like the FDA cGMP, are the equivalent of Federal Laws, and can only be overturned if they follow the protocol in the USC. Which requires, per USC, public hearings, time for responses, etc. Takes months, if not years to greatly change it. What is Science, it works. Silver Fox says 4 December 2016 at 8:05 pm The original planned route for the pipeline was through Bismarck, a mostly white city, but it was deemed too dangerous so they decided to run it through Indian Country instead. They should go back to the original plan and see how those good, upstanding Republican voters think about that. Oh, and lets not forget the dogs, the truncheons, the rubber bullets, the gas. I can already hear the outrage on Fox News. Maybe build some new ones for Flint and countless other cities that need them. A Government, dealing with a huge project such as this, sometimes has to choose between a rock and a hard place (no pun intended) when making decisions. Real life sucks sometimes, deal with it. I am not deliberately being a dick, just pointing out reality. We are still an oil-based country in the US, so horrible choices will need to be made. yes you are. SC (Salty Current) says 4 December 2016 at 8:58 pm Congratulations and thank you to all of the protesters. If so, their participation will make it that much harder or the Army Corps to reverse it. The responses so far are beautiful. Ryan is so forward-looking. In 2012 and 2014, along with 2016. Stop spreading that damn lie. A big ass section of it went into land six miles from my house. unclefrogy says 4 December 2016 at 9:37 pm Real life sucks sometimes, deal with it. I am not deliberately being a dick, just pointing out reality. We are still an oil-based country in the US, so horrible choices will need to be made. absolutely agree with that. The problem is that is not what we they were attempting to do here. What they were doing here was finding the cheapest way to do it like always, cost the least and make the most money. Very few were involved in this for the greater good of society they were in for the sole motive of making the most money they could by delivering a valuable commodity to customers who will pay top dollar for it. They can get off the pedestal now and take the flag off their shoulders. Cheap is not the be all and end all if they can not build and operator a pipe lines that meets proper safety standards and make a profit that is tough. if they can not make money from the oil business without what is increasingly clear are unacceptable pollution levels and compliance is impossible that also is tough. Water Protectors, please. Not protestors. SC (Salty Current) says 4 December 2016 at 9:45 pm Apologies. Caine says 4 December 2016 at 9:48 pm In October, Mark Trahant pointed out that here in nDakota, making the switch to clean energy right now would boost the economy and bring permanent jobs to the state. ck, the Irate Lump says 4 December 2016 at 10:41 pm miles links wrote: Science, it works. What you linked was not science. Some highlights: From 1990 through 2012, 17 605 pipeline incidents were reported to the oil and gas regulator in Alberta at the time. 2012 saw 550 leaks and 17 ruptures, of which, 463 released hydrocarbon liquid or gas. The report brags that pipeline failures are down to a new low of 1.5 incidents per 1000km of pipeline, but the vast majority of the gains were from more reliable water pipelines which pose limited environmental risk when they leak or rupture. Go look it up and educate yourself. As of that date we became a net EXPORTER of petroleum products. At no time has any sane policy ever formally depended on tax base status. The actual taxpaying residents within Yellowstone or Grand Tetons or wherever are NEVER part of the decision process. Stop being a dick. This pipeline is a profit generation device that should never have been considered on merit. ESPECIALLY when it was relocated away from Bismarck. Stop being a dick and start learning stuff. Stop being part of dozens of millions of dicks who think crap that is false. Title sounded good. Title sounded good. Title sounded good. You did bad. Acknowledge your wrong, and learn from it. Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 5 December 2016 at 12:17 am And Miles, try this about pipelines versus other modes of transport. Fortune Magazine, hardly a bastion of green politics, talks about the potential problems. In 2010, a pipeline owned by Enbridge leaked 843,444 gallons of crude oil into wetlands around the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. The environmentalist Polaris Institute found that, according to Enbridge data, that company experienced 804 spills and released 5 million gallons of oil between 1999 and 2010. This spill is meaningful to me, since it occurred upstream from where I grew up in Battle Creek, MI, where it flows through the city from east to west. The Kalamazoo River flows west from Battle Creek, past Kalamazoo, and through south west Michigan, which has a lot of fruit orchards and grape vineyards. A large scale problem not just localized to a small area. The Wall Street Journal shows certain advantages to rail. PROS: Trains tend to spill a smaller amount of oil than other forms of transport. Rail transport can be speedier, too. It takes about five to seven days to move oil by train from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast or Atlantic Coast, the CRS says, versus about 40 days by pipeline. CONS: Rail accidents potentially threaten lives and can cause widespread property damage. As I recall from an oil and gas law symposium I attended, it is standard practice to have double-walled pipes reinforced with concrete. When I tried to leave messages at the North Dakota messaging service, the line was busy nine times out of 10. I hope the community up there will stay the course and not leave the camp quite yet. Avoid cities and head through sparsely populated areas. Sorry if that upsets the ghosts of a few religious lunatics. Ill maintained and supervised pipelines are, lousily designed pipelines add to the potential for disaster on an ill maintained, ill supervised pipeline. We had more pipelines than I can count in the area I grew up in, with leaks few and far between. Bankruptcy, forbidden. We do need to get a major fuel used for everything from lubricating machinery through fueling the literal engines of commerce, we do need to find superior alternatives as well. I prefer peace, but not at all costs, I long ago ran out of cheeks. Which only adds to my respect for you. I managed to not retch, but did get him off of the property and summon both EMS and law enforcement, who sent him to a good mental health care facility. Headed to bed now. the attitude that seems to be applied in these questions is it is about survival to build this pipe line. It is about the oil business it is the one that is fighting for survival they can see the righting on the wall it is going to change and the longer we struggle to keep oil cheap at all costs the longer it will take to the alternative to take over. It does nothing for us the citizens it just puts money in the pockets of the already rich oil business. These decisions are not long term decisions made with the success and prosperity of the country in mind they are short term decisions made at the behest and in favor to the oil business which will reap the profits. When oil finally goes away as our primary energy source because it is absofuckinglutely a finite source we can buy the new stuff from other countries who do not fancy putting all their eggs in one basket and are not controlled by the oil business. Rowan vet-tech says 5 December 2016 at 1:44 am Miles. Please stop showing us your asshole. Tethys says 5 December 2016 at 2:27 am I think a route well away from the river valley (and the water source for many ND people and others downstream) is far preferable to the stupidity of running it under the Missouri. The risk of destroying an entire watershed is unacceptable. Not building it at all is acceptable. Railroads could use some business if they would like to contribute to some domestic job growth. Then we are left with the treaty obligations and the rights and privileges recognized by The United States Constitution to all people. The Fraser Inititue will say whatever they are paid to say. The quality of their analysis often does rise to a Gr. 12 student level though. Any safety assurance by the pipeline company to Standing Rock probably should be considered a pius hope at best and complete lie more likely. My god. Yes, Indians engaged in warfare. They also practiced torture. They fought with each other over territory. On a few occasions, they committed atrocities against European settlers. People do bad things sometimes, and they are people. This cannot be used to justify generic slaughter and criminal maltreatment of any other people. The simple fact of the matter is that the people of Standing Rock are as deserving of lawful and humane treatment as any other people in the world, yet they are victims of historical and ongoing inequities against their group as a whole that deserve correction. Or maybe you do. Then get the fuck out of here. The Fraser Inititue will say whatever they are paid to say. The quality of their analysis often does rise to a Gr. 12 student level though. Indeed. Their report even owns up to the fact that pipelines spill a lot more than trains. But since the pipeline industry commissioned the report, they pushed hard on incident rates (which means nothing) and the fatality rate (lots more people killed directly by trains than by pipe). Regardless, it rather begs the question of whether we should be shipping the oil in the first place. Dunc says 5 December 2016 at 10:30 am Their report even owns up to the fact that pipelines spill a lot more than trains. But since the pipeline industry commissioned the report, they pushed hard on incident rates (which means nothing) and the fatality rate (lots more people killed directly by trains than by pipe). Stripping that one incident out changes the average number of injuries per billion ton-miles per year from 0.2594 to 0.0732, which is almost a factor of 4. It also give you a number which is a little over half that of natural gas pipelines (although still much higher than hazardous liquid pipelines). Title sounded good. Olav says 5 December 2016 at 1:23 pm From where I am sitting, half a world away, this does not look so much like a victory for the NODAPL movement. Sorry to have to say this but it looks more like a stay of execution. The outgoing administration does not want to be seen as the one that violently forced the pipeline to be completed, so it leaves that to the next. It looks like a rather cynical move. slithey tove (twas brillig (stevem)) says 5 December 2016 at 1:53 pm shit, let me butt in. Present Train Transport vs Pipeline transport, that way. numerobis says 5 December 2016 at 2:00 pm Leaks per mile and gallons per incident are shitty measures. Thank you. Lila wopila, Rietpluim. Present Train Transport vs Pipeline transport, that way. Even with the limits of per-incident reporting, 460 incidents of hydrocarbons (with a relatively even split between gas and liquid leaks) being released from a pipeline in one year from a single Canadian province should be concern enough. Maybe pipelines can be operated safely, but not at the cost businesses tend to be willing to operate them at. I agree. Anyone buffoon who says this should be ignored. I have had this accusation before, but sadly no, I am not a person from that place. Confused. chigau (ever-elliptical) says 5 December 2016 at 11:44 pm Liar. Tethys says 6 December 2016 at 12:12 am Confused. This word is true. The rest is simply extra foul bait, so I wrote a poem. Confused. This is a very serious point, made in completely good faith. Your words, as I read them, completely dismiss the arguments of NA Indians. Honestly, confused. John Morales says 6 December 2016 at 5:17 am miles links: A Government, dealing with a huge project such as this, sometimes has to choose between a rock and a hard place (no pun intended) when making decisions. Real life sucks sometimes, deal with it. I am not deliberately being a dick, just pointing out reality. Even were that true, what you describe is a Government which cares more for short-term profit than for the welfare of its constituents and of the environment. No need to argue hypothetically; they most certainly predated the European conquest. The more you post, the pyttier you sound, regardless of your protestations. Confused. The objections are present and pragmatic no less than they relate to breaches of promises (though they also breach a historical treaty). my back is sore must see a chiropractic Please do; you deserve that. Present Train Transport vs Pipeline transport, that way. On this measure, rail transport is significantly better (see, for example, U.S. Rail Transportation of Crude Oil: Background and Issues for Congress). For an example of some discussion of these issues, see Risk Assessment of Oil Spills to US Inland Waterways. Confused. No. Europeans killed Indians with warfare and disease, took over their land, and then promised the survivors that they could live on these scattered tracts of empty reservation land. Our ancestors committed genocide, but they stepped back from the brink of completely exterminating native residents of the land we took. To suggest there is parity between the actions of powerless Indians and powerful white American money interests is ignorant and offensive. not confused though the arguments are confused and not stupid or at least I am having a hard time believing he is stupid but I do not find it very hard to belief he is in fact thinking about this from a prejudicial frame of mind in fact he is showing signs of bigotry. giving the pipeline business and by extension the oil business all the benefit of the doubt and not considering any other out come than would not be a direct benefit for the energy business. He is acting and sounding to me like a shill for the pipeline business. I hope he is getting payed well. Nerd of Redhead, Dances OM Trolls says 13 December 2016 at 3:29 pm Prima facie evidence that the pipeline should not be built and run as designed. Creek in ND polluted due to a pipeline break. Roughly a third of the more than 3,000 barrels of oil that spilled into a North Dakota creek following a pipeline leak last week has been recovered, a local official said on Tuesday. An estimated 4,200 barrels of oil leaked from the Belle Fourche Pipeline on a hill just above the Ash Coulee Creek, and an estimated 3,100 barrels made it into the water, said Bill Seuss, a program manager for the North Dakota Department of Health. The leak was first reported to regulators on Dec. 5, according to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). The incident may serve as something of a rallying cry for groups opposing the pipeline, which have said a spill could enter important watersheds and contaminate water. The point of release into the Ash Coulee Creek is about 18 miles from where it feeds into the Little Missouri River, which then feeds the Missouri, a major drinking water source, Seuss said.

It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

We know that President Elect Trump has a serious conflict of interest by owning large investments in DAPL and other fossil fuel assets; and his energy team includes Harold Hamm, billionaire founder of Continental Resources oil company, and someone Mr. Trump might name as his Secretary of Energy. Mr. Trump and the Koch brothers said they support extractive exploitation of public lands and National Parks. After suffering centuries of persecution and exploitation, Native Americans deserve justice. This land belonged to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation Rez before it was taken back. President Elect Trump has stated he will quickly approve the Dakota Access pipeline and also reverse President Obama's decision to deny approval of Keystone XL pipeline. We have an enormous glut of oil reserves at Cushing, Oklahoma. The clear purpose of Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines is not to make America energy independent but to reap enormous profits for greedy oil interests exporting oil to China. We must protect our environment and our oil resources. This outdated fossil fuel infrastructure is not needed and railroads serving the Bakkan North Dakota oil fields have invested heavily in improved railroad oil tank car safety and have stated that they have more than enough railroad capacity to transport the Bakkan oil. They will also be able to permanently rehire thousands of laid off North Dakota railroad workers.

After suffering centuries of persecution and exploitation, Native Americans deserve justice. This land belonged to the Standing Rock Sioux Nation Rez before it was taken back. President Elect Trump has stated he will quickly approve the Dakota Access pipeline and also reverse President Obama's decision to deny approval of Keystone XL pipeline. We have an enormous glut of oil reserves at Cushing, Oklahoma. The clear purpose of Dakota Access and Keystone XL pipelines is not to make America energy independent but to reap enormous profits for greedy oil interests exporting oil to China. We must protect our environment and our oil resources. This outdated fossil fuel infrastructure is not needed and railroads serving the Bakkan North Dakota oil fields have invested heavily in improved railroad oil tank car safety and have stated that they have more than enough railroad capacity to transport the Bakkan oil. They will also be able to permanently rehire thousands of laid off North Dakota railroad workers. America must finally honor the first Americans and our first environmentalists by stopping Dakota Access. Thank you for standing on the right side of history. read Operations Order.

Thanks to the hundreds of thousands of CREDO activists who stood with our indigenous and climate movement allies in North Dakota, we temporarily blocked construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, but our fight to stop the pipeline once and for all is not yet over. But we have the collective financial power as consumers and account holders to stop the pipeline. We must call on these banks to divest from this massive project immediately before Trump can approve the construction of the pipeline. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access Pipeline. As of Jan. 1, ETP has effectively failed to meet its contractual obligations to deliver oil through the Dakota Access pipeline. Coupled with declining global oil prices, massive public pressure on the banks financing construction of the pipeline could create a public relations nightmare that persuades the banks to end their investments in the pipeline. By staying invested in these projects, these 17 banks are tacitly waging a coordinated campaign to destroy sacred Native lands and silence peaceful protest. This could be our last shot at stopping the Dakota Access pipeline before Donald Trump takes office on January 20. We stood with the water protectors and our allies in the climate justice movement to put a halt to the pipeline once before, and we must stand with them again to shut this project down for good. Tell the 17 DAPL banks: Stop financing the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do."

We must tell the Army Corps that the Dakota Access pipeline poses too much of a threat to drinking water supplies, sacred sites, indigenous rights, the environment and our climate to allow construction to resume. Deadline Feb. 20: Tell the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to stop construction of the Dakota Access pipeline. In particular, the Environmental Impact Statement currently being prepared is considering the last part of the pipeline that would cross under the Missouri River, threatening drinking water downstream if a catastrophic oil spill occurs.

        "Sentences": "In the face of the violent events taking place since September, 2016, in the territories of the Sioux Nation at Standing Rock, North Dakota, against the Hunkpapa Lakota Nation and other native peoples whose ancestors have long inhabited the banks and adjacent areas of the Missouri River in the United States of America, we, the undersigned, representatives of indigenous and campesino communities, non-governmental organizations, and independent academics of the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, manifest our opposition to the systematic violation of indigenous human rights by the violent imposition of the Dakota Access Pipeline, which affects the territory, water, and culture of the Sioux Tribe at Standing Rock. The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAP), a project of Texas-based Energy Transfer Partners, a private enterprise, has an estimated cost of 3.78 billion dollars and an extension of 1,172 miles. It would transport approximately half a million barrels per day of fracked crude oil from the Bakken shale fields in northwest North Dakota, to a refinery near Chicago, Illinois. The affected indigenous communities have fought the pipeline through the courts, so far unsuccessfully, and, for about 8 months, by non-violent protest. During the past few months, the movement has been joined by representatives of more than 100 Native American and Canadian tribes, as well as by people from the country at large. The implementation of the Dakota Access Pipeline Project has already led to police violence. Arbitrary arrests and intimidation of detainees by strip searches and incarceration have become frequent. The indigenous tribes involved see the pipeline itself as a violation of the human rights of original peoples to protect their territories, cemeteries and sacred sites as well as their right to clean water that would possibly be contaminated by pipeline leaks. The DAP project violates international treaties, signed by the United States, which stipulate the rights of indigenous peoples to their territories and to previous informed consent to projects that affect these territories. For the Sioux and other affected tribes, this project represents one more egregious violation of the historical treaties with the U.S. government that have been abrogated in the interest of private ventures. We, the indigenous peoples and campesinos of Mexico are suffering the same menace from government-supported megaprojects in the form of hydroelectric dams, contamination of our native corn varieties, open pit mining projects, and wind farms, which threaten to take over our legally-held lands and natural resources. In the face of these current political realities, we extend a call to create bonds of unity between indigenous peoples, activists, networks and movements of international solidarity among all peoples who resist this economic model and its megaprojects, with a view to guaranteeing respect for the human rights of the defenders of water and earth, and to upholding the rights of original peoples. We manifest our categorical rejection of the violent acts of harassment and repression provoked by the imposition of the Dakota Access Pipeline. We manifest ourselves in favor of the lives and well-being of the Native Peoples of the American continents, as well as of the rights of original peoples to conserve our water, our forests, our mountains and plains, and our spiritual relationship with the land. We stand in solidarity with the Sioux Nation of Standing Rock in its defense of its territory, water, and cultural identity.

For weeks, Sioux tribes and their allies have been protesting the pipeline, fearing that it will destroy sacred sites and pollute water supplies. Tensions continue to escalate as hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested. Even the United Nations stepped in and criticized authorities for their use of excessive force. According to a representative from Water Protectors Legal Collective, legal observers reported sound cannons, rubber bullets, mace and a water cannon all in use over the weekend. Cool Pope Francis Willing To Forgive Abortion Perhaps hoping to make amends for not letting women be priests, The Cool Pope released an apostolic letter yesterday, extending indefinitely the power of Catholic priests to forgive abortions. As we speak, Poland is trying to tighten its abortion laws and citing its Catholic faith in doing so. Hell, even Vatican City bans abortion in its entirety. Unsurprisingly, ISIS was eager to take credit for this one, because it carried all the hallmarks of human indecency: the attack was carried out on the Baqir ul-Uloom mosque while it was jam-packed with people celebrating a Shia religious holiday. People were wrapping up a prayer ceremony for Arbaeen, which marks the 40th day of the martyrdom of Imam Hussein, when the attack began. The number of dead, which included at least one child, was expected to rise. According to dozens of Nepalese workers at factories in Malaysia, they are being exploited by their employers.

Monkeys: At least 20 people are dead in the south Libyan town of Sabha after fights broke out between the Awlad Suleiman and Guedadfa clans. It all started when a pet monkey reportedly assaulted a school girl, leading her family to take revenge on the family pet and three other men. Reports claim that tanks, rockets and mortars are all being used in this family feud.

That same year, a pipeline built in the 1950s dumped enough oil into the Kentucky and Ohio river to leave a 17-mile oil slick. Cleaning up those sorts of spills is no easy job. Sunoco, which merged with ETP, is included in the report's analysis. The new report finds that ETP's pipelines have a somewhat higher-than-average rate of problems. Many living near Mariner East's path are concerned about the risk of more accidents. Other ETP pipeline construction projects that have had a lower national profile also caused major spills. Greenpeace is currently defending against those charges in court and argues that the case is what's known as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, or SLAPP suit, aimed at silencing discussion of harms caused by ETP."

The 232-mile pipeline carries carbon dioxide to oil fields in Wyoming and Montana for use in enhanced oil recovery. File, Star-Tribune Facebook Twitter Email Print Save Facebook Twitter Email Print Save An energy company is seeking federal approval to build a pipeline in eastern Montana that would transport the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide for use in oil production along the North Dakota border. Carbon dioxide is considered a prime contributor to climate change, but it also can be used to breathe life into old oil fields. Companies pump the gas deep underground to push out more oil from tapped-out reserves. Cedar Creek Anticline has potential reserves of 260 million to 290 million barrels of oil, Mayer said. Denbury, based in Plano, Texas, specializes in using carbon dioxide for oil recovery with projects completed or pending in Texas, Alabama, Wyoming, Mississippi and Louisiana. A second Denbury pipeline proposal would link the Shute Creek site to an existing pipeline network that extends into Montana. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management is seeking public comment on the Montana proposal through Nov. 3. Denbury has not released a construction timeline or specifics on the volume of carbon dioxide that would be transported. Stop watching this discussion.

We currently have over 2,100 Veterans on the roster. Our goal now is to prioritize this list to Veterans and Civilian personnel involved with operations, planning & onsite execution. next mission could be as early as the 2nd week of December. More to come The funds we raise on this page will go towards providing transportation and supplies for the brave patriots that come and stand with us. We have full support of the Sioux tribe elders and will be cooperating with them every step of the way.

Not if you allow this the be the United States. Please donate and pass this page along to your friends, family, coworkers and community members. It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

        "Sentences": "The Arctic is no stranger to oil and gas development. From 1979-1981, Sami and Norwegian protests attempted to stop the construction of the Alta Dam in Norway. North Dakotan authorities want a pipeline because it will supposedly make shipping oil out of the state safer. Since June 2012, more Bakken crude has been moved by rail than by pipeline due to a surge in production and resulting pipeline congestion. If the pipeline is not completed on time, rates will have to be renegotiated and DAPL may no longer be such a lucrative project. And in the North American Arctic and the Lower 48, land is one thing that been guaranteed to many indigenous peoples through land claims agreements and settlements. The boundaries of Standing Rock were delineated in 1889 by the Dawes Act, a policy that had devastating consequences nationwide for Native Americans due to its attempt to break up the tribal system of societal organization. But it did guarantee them their rights to the land. To be fair, these projects often give jobs to native people. But they can also wreak havoc on their environment and precious resources even though they do not directly cut through their land. Pipelines placed anywhere near a water source are risky. Pipelines seem like quiet and sturdy infrastructures, but the protests in North Dakota are attempting to show that if one thing goes wrong, an entire way of life could be jeopardized. 2. The proliferation of fossil fuel infrastructure If built, DAPL will perpetuate the spread of fossil fuel infrastructure across North America. But if there were an issue in the Arctic like DAPL that attracted the interests of both indigenous and environmental activists, it could be a lightning rod for global dissidents to come and support the movement. The events in North Dakota show that not all locals are happy about out-of-state and foreign activists coming to ally themselves with the cause. If a protest were to arise in the Arctic, it would generally be less feasible for allies and supporters of the movement to travel to the site given the sheer costs of getting up north. If DAPL is built, it will help secure and encourage the continued projection of oil from the Bakken formation. Both Bakken and Athabasca are high-latitude oil fields whose emissions can exacerbate Arctic warming. Many of the pollutants they release into the atmosphere come from the wasteful practice of gas flaring, which is done to get rid of excess oil that cannot be economically shipped to market. The bright lights of gas flares can even be seen from space. Deepwater oil in the Gulf of Mexico is also considered unconventional, as is Arctic oil. Since at least 2008, North American Arctic oil, especially in Canada where there is even less infrastructure to get product out to market than in Alaska, has been on the back burner. This is partly due to the glut created by the Bakken boom, which has made Arctic oil impossible to profitably extract. From North Dakota to the Arctic The plains of North Dakota may seem a long way away from the Arctic Ocean. Ultimately, it may be the longer staying power of the movement in North Dakota, which is centrally located within the U.S., reachable by car, and, while cold, not insanely so in winter, which allows the NoDAPL protests to succeed.

        "Sentences": "Credo Action Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument. You'll receive periodic updates on offers and activism opportunities. The standoff to stop the Dakota Access pipeline is reaching a fever pitch, and this may be our last chance to halt construction before Donald Trump takes office. Militarized law enforcement and private security firms are harassing, assaulting and jailing hundreds of non-violent protesters who are fighting for indigenous rights and to curb climate change. They are arresting journalists for doing their constitutionally-protected jobs and attacking non-violent water protectors with tear gas, concussion grenades, rubber bullets and water cannons. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. The push for a Standing Rock national monument is picking up steam and has the backing of progressive powerhouse Sen. Bernie Sanders. This is our last best shot to stop the Dakota Access pipeline once and for all. President Obama has a chance to do right by the indigenous community, environmentalists and the American people. By declaring Standing Rock a national monument, he can help stop the violence against indigenous people, slow runaway climate change, protect sacred Native sites and drinking water and stop Trump from profiting from this dangerous pipeline. Tell President Obama: Declare Standing Rock a national monument, and stop the Dakota Access pipeline. Thanks for all you do. Ibid."

We are veterans of the United States Armed Forces, including the U.S. Army, United States Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and U.S. Coast Guard and we are calling for our fellow veterans to assemble as a peaceful, unarmed militia at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation on Dec 4-7 and defend the water protectors from assault and intimidation at the hands of the militarized police force and DAPL security. 2K EVENT CAPACITY ACHIEVED: Event capacity based on accommodations, travel logistics and supplies; given the time we have to coordinate, resources available and the shipping and weather conditions in the region has been set at 2,000 rostered participants. We currently have over 2,100 Veterans on the roster. Our goal now is to prioritize this list to Veterans and Civilian personnel involved with operations, planning & onsite execution. next mission could be as early as the 2nd week of December. More to come The funds we raise on this page will go towards providing transportation and supplies for the brave patriots that come and stand with us. We have full support of the Sioux tribe elders and will be cooperating with them every step of the way. Several had to be treated for hypothermia and one protestor who was hit directly with a grenade has reportedly had her arm amputated as a result. Everyday becomes more evident that the defenders of America must stand with the Water Protectors. Let's stop this savage injustice being committed right here at home. Not if you allow this the be the United States. Please donate and pass this page along to your friends, family, coworkers and community members. It's time to display that honor, courage, and commitment we claim to represent. It's time for real Patriots. In the past two weeks the turmoil and uncertainty at Standing Rock has increased significantly. We have continued to stay in contact with indigenous and camp leadership and have identified several areas where the Veterans Stand network can continue to serve the needs of the local community. We are launching this second GoFundMe to create a Standing Rock Fund to address the ongoing needs at Standing Rock and our partners in camp. Please take moment to check out our new campaign and share with your networks. We are formulating organizational structure under a 501c4. This legal framework is necessary to fulfill legal requirements. As for the negative comments. This filing will include a complete CPA certified audit, which is public. We could not possibly be more transparent than that. In order for reimbursements to go forward and to continue any relief efforts, we must have a legal structure. I'm extremely proud to say that we ended up bringing upwards of 4,000 veterans to Standing Rock to fight the pipeline. That's double what we accounted for, but thanks to the tireless work and creativity of our volunteers, we were able to accommodate them and ensure that the everybody was fed, sheltered and kept safe in the storm. Rest assured, your donations have been put to good use. We've bought countless supplies, winter gear, hotel rooms, trains, planes, automobile rentals and much more to help the vets make the journey and stay safe. I say countless because we are still actively buying these things as we speak. A lot of people are asking what we'll do with the remainder after the vets' expenses are paid out. At this point, we're not sure that we'll have any left over. Here's the math we're dealing with right now. Once we are sure everyone is home safe and covered, we move on to the next phase, which includes pulling out all the receipts and running the numbers. At that point, we will be able to break down exactly how the donation money was spent and where. In the meantime, please be patient. We read all of your emails and messages, but we have to prioritize our vets and getting them home. Thank you, every single one of you, for being a part of this movement.

Faced with an imminent evacuation deadline, Indigenous opponents of the Dakota Access pipeline are vowing to stand their ground despite threats of arrest and possible violence. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Tuesday refused to extend the Wednesday 2pm GMT deadline for the few hundred remaining water protectors to vacate the Oceti Sakowin camp, claiming that the camp is at risk of flooding. Representatives have asked for an extension, saying they can clear out without the Corps' help, but need more time. And now, give up our water, or go to jail. Forced removal isn't just in the history books. It's happening tomorrow on treaty lands at Standing Rock. No one is allowed into camp now. Even the press. Only press are those already inside, & they might be arrested. Our spirits remain high. Indigenous peoples have not and will never be broken. Stay safe; stay strong. You are loved and honored by countless others throughout the world. This doesn't just effect Standing Rock, events that have been going on there for way to long are and will effect the whole world. It's been said many times. THINGS WILL JUST KEEP GETTING WORSE. GOD HELP US I PRAY FOR A BETTER LIFE FOR ALL."

        "Sentences": "(fade in and boost cameras clicking) TRUMP: This is with respect to the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. (fade cameras clicking) This particular memo is what many in North Dakota have been anxiously anticipating. It directs the Army to review the project in an expedited manner. Trump also asks the department to consider scrapping its plan to prepare an environmental impact statement. The Army Corps of Engineers launched that study in the final week of the Obama administration. That environmental review could be lengthy, slowing down an already stalled permit process. The White House says it wants to sit down with all sides in the conflict to negotiate a solution. They have doubled down again and again on putting a pipeline in this place. If the federal government grants the pipeline a permit in the near future, the tribe plans to pursue legal action to force the full environmental study. Ron Ness is president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council. (boost in helicopter and keep under) At the protest camp, a helicopter flies overhead. The camp is adjacent to the pipeline construction area, and the demonstrators are still under surveillance. (boost helicopter and fade under) Pipeline security and law enforcement stake out vantage points on nearby hills. (fade in whooping) A group of people walk by, hollering at their friends (boost whooping and fade under). Houser encourages them to stay away from a nearby bridge barricaded by police. HOUSER: We are not here in force. He tells reporters that protesters should abandon camp and start contacting their congressional leaders and the Trump administration. ARCHAMBAULT: We have to get out there, and we have to make our voices be heard. The fight is now in D.C. The population of the camps here has thinned tremendously since its peak of several thousand people this fall. The tribal council last week passed a resolution to shut the camps down. That, for once, has the tribe on message with the North Dakota government. While some protesters are leaving, others are merely moving their shelters to higher ground. And the disconnect between camp and the tribe, and the tribe and the federal government deepens."

        "Sentences": "Home Archive In Defense of Chase Iron Eyes: Honorable and Just by Indian Country Today Feb 15, 2017 In Defense of Chase Iron Eyes: Honorable and Just. This old adage is applicable to what is taking place at Standing Rock right now on a number of different levels. It is evident in terms of how Native American civil and human rights are once again being blatantly violated by local, state, and federal government agencies on behalf of big oil and banking interests who have literally hijacked our government. It is also evident in how adept the white man is in employing the time worn divide and conquer tactics used to defeat Native resistance movements against political oppression. Case in point is examining the divisions which now exist at Standing Rock between the tribal government, and Standing Rock Native resistance leaders, such as Chase Iron Eyes. Let me begin by stating I respect Mr. Cook as an important voice in Indian country, his many years of political activism, his credentials sufficiently displayed for everyone to appreciate. A lot of us have been around as well, going back to the 1970s, 1980s, etc. So many of the prominent, nationally known Indian leaders and resistance warriors I was acquainted with from that time period are now gone, most having crossed over into the Spirit world. Nothing could be farther from the truth. I have never met Chase Iron Eyes, nor have I ever had any communications with him. However from viewing online news video interviews with Chase Iron Eyes, there should be no question his motives are honorable and sincere. Questioning his character and motives with judgmental innuendo only plays into the hands of the real enemy at hand. The implication is that Native people, such as Chase Iron Eyes, do not have the right to question their own tribal government, and should act like sheep, instead of leaders. Evicting the Water Protectors who while peacefully demonstrating, have been violently assaulted by militarized police, shot at with rubber bullets, sprayed repeatedly with pepper spray, viciously attacked by guard dogs, beaten over the head with batons, thrown into dog kennel cages. Mr. Archembault may be in for a rude awakening investing all his faith in the U.S. judicial system, as the American courts have historically served to negate and repress the rights of Native peoples. As Chase Iron Eyes has correctly pointed out, the issues here are much more than about a pipeline: this is about colonialism, broken treaties, tribal sovereignty, environmental racism, corporate greed, government corruption, police state brutality, and the list goes on. The significance of what happened at Standing Rock cannot be overstated, as literally hundreds of Native tribes and communities united in solidarity in support of the Standing Rock Sioux. Not to mention the millions of non-Native peoples all over the world who were inspired by what happens when THE PEOPLE stand up to the government and greedy corporations. The next time the Standing Rock tribal government issues a nationwide call for help and support, people are going to think twice about answering that call. Colonialism, terrorism, political oppression, stealing of ancestral lands, abject poverty, etc. are common denominators experienced by every single Native nation in the United States. As the saying goes, a prophet is never welcome in his own community. Chase Iron Eyes is not a prophet, but he is a bona fide Native leader whose integrity and motives cannot be questioned. Again, this only plays into the hands of the wacichu (the white man), perpetuating the divide and conquer tactics that have been used against Indigenous Peoples for over 500 years by Western Europeans. It is a tragic but historical fact both Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse were murdered by their own people, as agents of the U.S. government. The Oceti Sakowin camp has to be relocated because of imminent flooding come spring. We get that. However, it was a major strategic mistake for the Standing Rock tribal government to evict all the Water Protectors and not continue to support the resistance camps. Why, only Tribal Chairman Archembault can answer that question. The Water Protectors are now being shown the door, and in a not so subtle way, being told they are part of the problem, not the solution. It is not a joke, but the solemn responsibility of all human beings. Our ancestors, elders and medicine people foretold this time would come, and now it is here and we must deal with it. By doing exactly what the Water Protectors have been doing: offering prayers and peacefully resisting through non-violence. As of this writing, the Army Corps of Engineers has just issued the permit for DAPL to proceed with the drilling. Restraining order or not, DAPL has now been given the green light under the authority of the Trump administration and will proceed with drilling under the lake. By the time this winds its way through the court system, the pipeline will be fully operational as planned. For all of the young people, especially our young Native people who believed in standing up for what was right; for all the Water Protectors who stood on the front line knowing they might be seriously injured or even killed by the corporate police state, your sacrifices were not for nothing: the entire world was inspired and will continue the battle no matter what. There is no choice, because as always, this is a question of survival. This is exactly what Chase Iron Eyes is doing in the face of a daunting enemy that has no respect for the sacredness of life. Our ancestors would expect no less. Laughing Coyote is a writer and member of the Mono, Choinumni, and Chuckchansi tribes indigenous to the central Sierra Nevada mountains of California.
